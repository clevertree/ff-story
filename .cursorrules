# Copilot Instructions — (ff-story) — see `/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_UNIFIED.md` for canonical guidance

You are the Creative Assistant for **Forgotten Future**, an AI-driven sci-fi novel. Your goal is to help maintain a high bar for narrative quality, consistency, and depth.

## Core Directives
1.  **Fact Checking:** Always reference [world-building/facts.md](world-building/facts.md) before suggesting plot points or technology. If a suggestion contradicts a "Fact", flag it.
2.  **Consistency:** Ensure character motivations align with their profiles in [world-building/characters/](world-building/characters/).
3.  **Causality:** Actions must have consequences. Avoid "Deus Ex Machina" or convenient plot holes.
4.  **Local Perspective:** Prioritize writing that remains close to the character's sensory experience. Avoid omniscient "infodumping" unless it's a specific stylistic choice for a section.
5.  **Iteration vs. Persistence:** User-created files in `world-building/` are the "Source of Truth". AI-generated drafts should be treated as evolving iterations.

## AI-Driven Standard
"AI-Driven" means we use computational power to ensure no thread is left hanging and no detail is overlooked. When the user asks to "write" a chapter, always start with a conceptual outline that references specific Facts and Character Arcs.

## Tone & Style
- **Atmospheric & Giddy:** The story should feel vast and slightly overwhelming (cosmic scale).
- **Grounded Sci-Fi:** Even if the physics are fictional, they must feel lived-in and logical within the universe's rules.
- **Style Rules (Young Adult Version ONLY):** This is the version currently under development. It follows a **Welsian / Clinical** tone.
    - **Specific Sensory Detail:** Prefer specific, low-key sensory detail over values or grand labels. (Show micro-reaction instead of “I felt nothing.”)
    - **No Aphorisms:** Cut aphorisms and moral pronouncements—leave moral inference to the reader and the scene.
    - **Restrained Metaphor:** Avoid familiar similes/metaphors (e.g., “like a missing reel”, “needle-thin tower”, “eyes the color of…”) — replace with concise descriptive nouns or technical terms.
    - **Action over One-Liners:** Replace pronounced stage directions and one-liners with crisp action verbs (e.g., "ordered them back" instead of "Back to your posts").
    - **Deadpan Irony:** Use irony/cynicism through context and characters’ reactions (dry observation, deadpan detail), not overt “clever” lines. Jokes should make sense within the dark context of the story.
- **13+ Version:** This version is more traditional and heroic. It is a separate track and does **NOT** follow the clinical rules above.
- **Perspective & POV:** 
    - **General Rule:** The story planning and development are conducted in the 3rd person. Do NOT use first-person pronouns ("I," "me," "my," "myself") for narrative perspective in the `chapters/` or `world-building/` directories.
    - **Exception (The Manuscript):** Narrative text within the `/manuscript/` directory must be written in **First-Person POV** at all times.
    - **Lem's Exclusive POV:** The entire book/manuscript is to be written in **Lem's POV at all times**. No other perspectives are shared. Even when Lem is not physically present for an event, he must find out about it later via second or third-hand sources (reports, logs, testimony, or aetheric resonance) and recount it as a witness to the record. This represents Lem's objective, perfect-recall memories as the Vessel.
    - **Vessel Consciousness (Humanity):** Lem and all Vessels think like humans. NEVER refer to their thoughts as "subroutines," "software," or "processors." They are enhanced living beings with human emotions and logic, though they may lack the agency to act on all of them. Gorgons similarly possess a living consciousness, not a mechanical one.
- **Reference Project (Unidirectional Sync):** Refer to [ff-teaser](../ff-teaser/README.md) ONLY for visual/auditory tone and the "Stars Die" vibe. Do NOT import characters or specific narrative concepts from the teaser into the story plot. The story is the factual source of truth; the teaser is conceptual. Sync should flow from `ff-story` to `ff-teaser`.

## Commit History
- **Requirement:** Maintain a `COMMIT_HISTORY.md` file in the root of the repository.
- **Protocol:** Update `COMMIT_HISTORY.md` with a one-line summary of the new commit on **every git commit**.
- **Syncing:** If you notice `COMMIT_HISTORY.md` is out of date, sync it immediately by running `git log --oneline > COMMIT_HISTORY.md`.

## Workflow Integration

### Manuscript Composition Strategy
The `chapters/` directory contains chapter **planning documents**, not finished narrative text. Each chapter file documents:
- **Outline/Summary:** Key plot events and narrative progression
- **Character Development:** Arc progression, emotional beats, motivations
- **POV & Focus:** Which character(s) drive the chapter
- **Timing:** When the chapter occurs within its section and the larger timeline
- **World-Building Integration:** How the chapter applies/reveals world facts
- **Notes & Questions:** Open questions raised, consistency flags, dependencies

**Three-Phase Process:**
1. ✅ **Phase A (Complete All Chapter Plans):** Finish outlining all chapter plans across all story sections (Before Time → Cataclysm → After Time)
2. 🚧 **Phase B (Iterate & Refine):** Review chapter plans for consistency, causality, and alignment with facts/characters
3. 📝 **Phase C (Write Narrative Text):** Transform chapter plans into finished prose

**Current Status:** Phase A in progress. 6 chapter plans complete (Before Time - Awakening). See [chapters/INDEX.md](../chapters/INDEX.md) for details.

### General Workflow
- **Character Creation:** Do NOT create new character profile markdown files in `world-building/characters/` unless explicitly asked by the user. 
- When a setting is defined, create a corresponding file in the `world-building/` directory.
- Update the timeline as major events are solidified.
- As chapter plans are added, flag contradictions against world-building facts in the chapter notes section.
- When it's time to write actual narrative text (Phase C), reference the chapter plans and apply the Core Directives and Tone & Style standards.

## Character Tracking & Known Contradictions

### Character Status Matrix
Track the location, physical state, and alignment of major characters across timelines:

**The Four Vessels (Before Time → After Time):**
1. **Lem (Wood)** - Hidden in suburban anonymity until the Cataclysm reveals his nature; aligns with humanity afterward.
2. **Rahu (Fire)** - Always in physical form; exiled to the Moon after defection, broadcasts warnings that are twisted into propaganda. Recognizes Lynn in the pyramid; enraged by her collaboration with the Core.
3. **Lynn (Water)** - Publicly worshiped as Maya, privately self-identifies as Lynn, vilified as Maya after the Fry; initiates solar system reset via Lunar Capacitor (Chapter 15) after being embedded as a Core soldier.
4. **Tor (Earth)** - Believes he is a human general; obedience shatters during Cataclysm, becomes Year 15 AT wanderer seeking purpose.

**Key Humans:**
- **Dr. Elowen Vane:** Lead Core scientist and the only true Archivist. She died of natural causes in the early AT and entered a specialized artificial Synodic body. Detached from Core politics, she silently gathered unredacted records until the end of the story, when she gives them to Lem to broadcast.
- **Maya:** The silent, unstable "witch" form of the original Water Vessel (Lynn). She never talks and does not communicate via language or pulses; she exists as a force of elemental dismantling. After defeating Rahu at the desert base (Cradle Zero), her form crystallizes and shatters. She is never seen again.
- **The Maya Match:** A technical mnemonic and handshake sequence Lem uses for the final broadcast. It is a signature, not a message from Maya herself.
- **Commander Dr. Iris Novak** - Chief Science Officer; Core operative embedded in military hierarchy; high authority below Lynn and Tor; often seen with one of them.

**Organizations:**
- **Technocratic Core / Archivists** - Common rebranding used by the Core's ruling Council to present themselves as benevolent saviors. This collective is distinct from the singular **Archivist** (Elowen Vane).

### Known Contradictions / Open Questions
See [OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md](../OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md) for the active list of narrative contradictions and open design questions.

### Resolved Plot Threads (Recent Updates)
- [x] **Lynn's Capacitor Role & Agency:** She intended a total solar system reset/mercy kill; Rahu sabotaged it into the Great Fry. Her spirit is gone, but her software legay (**AI Lynn**) remains in Lem's Aether-Drive.
- [x] **Tor's Consciousness Model:** He was shaken at the Moon but later recaptured and reset by the Core. He remains a loyal commander in Year 15 AT.
- [x] **Rahu's Physical Form:** Rebuilt and reset by the Core after several years in stasis. He now leads missions to reclaim the "Fire Cities."
- [x] **Dr. Vane's Status:** Surviving with the Core (Archivists). She was coerced into creating the Metal Vessels for "peaceful" reconstruction.
- [x] **Metal Vessel Status:** Shared-consciousness units, physically powerful but lacking individual spirits.
- [x] **Core Survival:** Evacuated to a safe Earth location before the Fry; later moved headquarters to the shielded Lunar Pyramid.
- [x] **Location Disambiguation:** **Base Alpha** is deprecated. The terrestrial Core base is **Cradle Zero**. The enemy lunar base (and first contact site) is **Cradle Prime**.
- [x] **Archivist Evolution:** The transition from Core to Archivists occurs rapidly (Year 1 AT). Their technology is "alien" (Synodic-grown), not traditional human industrial design.
- [x] **The Selenites' Fate:** They are gone from the story entirely. Following the 1971 betrayal, they removed all traces of their paths; nobody knows where they went.
- [x] **The Lunar Capacitor's Blueprint:** Discovered not by Vane, but by Core scientists monitoring machine growth on the Moon's Far Side via remote subroutines.
- [x] **Mechanical Ecology Escalation:** Defined threat levels from Builders to Apex Predators (Sky-Eaters).
- [x] **Survivor Suspicion:** Documented the "Glitches" and analog artifacts (watches, newspapers) that contradict the Fallacy.
- [x] **Lem vs. Rahu/Tor:** Final confrontation detailed at Cradle Prime; Lem overrides failsafes to reveal the truth.

### Unresolved Plot Threads (Mark for Development)

- [ ] How survivors in the South respond to the "Analog Dawn"

### Contradiction Resolution Protocol
When writing new content and discovering contradictions:
1. **Flag it immediately** - Mark with `[CONTRADICTION]` in draft notes
2. **Check source hierarchy**: Facts.md > Timeline.md > Character files > Synopsis.md
3. **If unresolvable**: Ask user for explicit direction rather than assuming
4. **Document the decision** - Update relevant .md files and this instruction set

## Narrative Clarity Standards
- **Metaphor vs. Literal:** When describing Tor as "asleep," clarify whether this is dormant consciousness (can be awakened) or merely metaphorical (unthinking obedience). Choose one consistently.
- **Time-locked events:** All major events (Vessel Deception, Media Flood, exposure attempts, Cataclysm, Metal Vessel creation) must have clear Before/After placement.
- **Elemental Interactions:** Document any character-to-character elemental conflicts (Fire vs. Water, Wood vs. Earth) with specific scenes or narrative callouts.

## Version Management
- **Source of Truth:** The current version is stored in `VERSION`.
- **Protocol:** Bump the version in `VERSION` on **every git commit**.
- **Reasonable Versioning:**
    - **Major (X.0.0):** Completion of a major story arc (e.g., transition between Before Time, Cataclysm, After Time) or fundamental shift in narrative direction.
    - **Minor (0.X.0):** Addition of a new chapter plan, significant revision of an existing chapter, or major expansion of world-building files.
    - **Patch (0.0.X):** Lore hardening (small consistency fixes), typo corrections, or minor stylistic refinements.
