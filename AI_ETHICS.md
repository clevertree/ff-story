# AI Ethics for Modern Authorship

In the age of generative AI and automated agents, the role of the author is evolving from a solitary creator to a "Creative Director" of a complex machine-assisted workflow. This document outlines the ethical standards and operational guidelines for using AI in the production of high-quality narrative content.

## General Ethical Guidelines
1. **Human Sovereignty:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for the human spark. The core emotional truth, thematic depth, and creative direction must originate from a sentient mind.
2. **Transparency:** Authors should be open about their use of AI tools. Whether in the colophon or a dedicated "How This Was Made" section, transparency builds trust with the readership.
3. **Data Integrity:** Ensure that the input data for the AI (the "lore") is original and consistent. The AI should be used to explore the author's world, not to pull from copyrighted external databases without permission.
4. **Attribution and Respect:** If an AI model or specific agent was pivotal to the process, acknowledging the technology's contribution reflects a modern understanding of collaborative creation.

## The CleverTree AI Commandments

These rules define the boundary between "AI-assisted authorship" and "soulless generation."

### The Do's: Automation and Efficiency
- **Plan and Structure:** AI should be used to generate and organize chapter plans, ensuring that the narrative arc remains coherent.
- **Guideline Management:** Automate the creation and maintenance of writing guidelines (style, tone, perspective) to ensure consistency across large manuscripts.
- **Auditing and QA:** Use AI to perform routine audits for contradictions in lore, pacing issues, and narrative flow. 
- **Menial Task Automation:** Automate tasks like formatting, metadata generation, and summarizing previous chapters for context.
- **Support Staff Role:** The AI should act as a tireless support staff, handling the "plumbing" of the story so the author can focus on the "soul."

### The Don'ts: The Sacred Core
- **No Generative Plotting:** AI should NOT be used to generate the actual story plot or the primary story concepts. These must come from the author.
- **No "In-Between" Voids:** The specific activities, character interactions, and micro-moments that happen between major plot points must be directed by the author's vision.
- **No Unrefined Output:** Never publish AI-generated text without a thorough human review. 

### The Creative Boundary
- **Idea Generation vs. Plot Execution:** It is perfectly acceptable to use AI for brainstorming sessions and "what if" scenarios. However, once an idea is selected, the specific execution of that plot—the "A to B" logic—must be defined by the author.
- **Strict Guidelines for Final Text:** It is permissible to generate the entire final text using AI agents, provided they are operating under strict, human-defined guidelines. 
- **The Golden Rule of QA:** Every single line of the final manuscript must be quality-assured (QA'd) by a human. No section is considered "Final" until a person has verified its emotional weight and technical accuracy.

## Intellectual Property and Fair Use
The risk of unintentional plagiarism is a reality of LLM usage. We adhere to the following policy:
- **The Response Protocol:** If an AI accidentally incorporates an idea or sequence that belongs to another creator, and they can prove it, the author must:
    1. **Change the story significantly:** Rewrite the section to ensure it is no longer a "rip-off" and retains original character and world-building fingerprints.
    2. **Negotiate Royalty Sharing:** If the idea is too central to be removed or is of such quality that the author wishes to keep it, a fair royalty share should be negotiated with the original creator. Use of someone else's idea warrants compensation; it's only fair!

*Ethics are the bedrock of the "Forgotten Future" project. By following these rules, we ensure that while our tools are futuristic, our stories remain human.*
