# Outstanding Questions & Plot Contradictions: Forgotten Future

This document tracks unresolved narrative threads, potential contradictions, and open questions that need to be addressed to ensure consistency across the Forgotten Future universe.

---

## ✅ Resolved Plot Threads

### 1. Anton Drexler's Location & Presence
- **Resolution:** All Core leadership, including Anton Drexler, moved from the Lunar Pyramid (Cradle Prime) to the desert base (Cradle Zero) by the end of Mission 2. The Moon was significantly harder to inhabit than the terrestrial base, and most leadership now considers the desert base their new official home.

### 2. Rahu's Year 15 AT Deployment Timeline
- **Resolution:** After his breakdown in Mission 1, Rahu underwent a "slow-burn" reset during Mission 2 to sanitize his memory of the 202X Truth. He was redeployed in Mission 3 for the "Northern Shield." He is reliable so long as he is kept away from Lem.

### 3. The "Fire" in Lem's Stasis Dream
- **Resolution:** The "fire" in Chapter 36 is a recursive vision of a massacre—thermal flashes from Gorgon weaponry disintegrating the White Forest. It is not the "Beckoning Fire" from Chapter 41.

### 4. The Existence of Arlo (Maya)
- **Resolution:** Arlo is the reincarnation of the original Water Vessel spirit (known to the Core and Lem as "Maya"). Arlo rejects this name, viewing it as an unproven theory.

### 5. The Core's Strategy regarding Arlo (Maya)
- **Resolution:** The Core was in a stalemate between "Capture/Cryo-sleep" (Containment) and "Kill/Beacon" (Consumption). This led to the Year 22 AT Diplomatic Ultimatum: Arlo must leave the village peacefully or the village will be destroyed.

### 6. The Exemption of the Northern Villages
- **Resolution:** The Core left them alone for years because they feared "unleashing the unknown" (a rogue Maya) without a containment plan. They only acted once Arlo's influence began causing cultural schisms in the Hive Cities.

### 7. The Core's Monolith Control & Propaganda
- **Resolution:** The Core publicly claims to have "liberated" the Moon base and the Monoliths from "Maya." City citizens cheer when Monoliths land. The Core uses the title **"King of the Gorgons"** as a bogeyman, promising that such power will only be held by their "democratic" collective.

## 🟡 Active Unresolved Questions

### 8. Plan B: Coordinated Strike vs. "Natural" Disaster
- **Context:** Arlo has refused the ultimatum. The Core must now initiate "Plan B" (Scorched Earth).
- **Question:** Will it be a coordinated military strike (overt aggression), or will they use a "natural" disaster (like a Sky-Monolith drop/impact) to maintain a facade of lack of control for the Hive Cities?

### 9. AI Lynn vs. Arlo (Individual Spirit)
- **Context:** Lynn's software "legacy" (AI Lynn) remains in Lem's Aether-Drive, while her spirit (Maya) is reincarnated as Arlo.
- **Question:** Is AI Lynn aware of Arlo's survival? How do they interact or resolve their shared identity in the finale? Does Arlo's "spiritual genius" come from memories of Lynn, or is it a new evolution?

### 10. Tor's Physical Agency
- **Context:** Tor is "grounded" and no longer goes on missions in Year 15 AT.
- **Question:** Is he physically damaged, or is the Core afraid of his psychological stability following his "shaking" on the Moon?

### 11. The Nature of Wood-Water Clusters
- **Context:** Wood and Water tech clusters are blooming in the North.
- **Question:** How do these form without an active Water Vessel's cooperation? Is it a byproduct of Arlo's physical proximity or AI Lynn's presence in Lem?

### 12. Cassia Vane's Agency and Rogue Diplomacy
- **Context:** Cassia warned Arlo about Plan B in Chapter 63.
- **Question:** How does the Core leadership react if they discover she leaked a destructive contingency? Does she have a sub-faction supporting her?

### 13. The Selenites' Total Disappearance
- **Context:** They are "gone entirely" as of 1971.
- **Question:** Is there zero chance of their return, or could a "fragment" of their technology still exist inside the Moon?

### 14. Arlo's Pronouns & Identity Shift
- **Context:** Documentation uses "he/him" for Arlo, but some Stalemate summaries used "she/her" (referring to the Maya influence).
- **Question:** Should his identity be strictly "he/him" despite the Maya connection, or does the spirit influence his self-conception over the years? (**Confirmed:** Arlo rejects the name Maya and the theory).

### 15. The "Analog Interface" Backlash
- **Context:** Interfacing with digital records causes a "psychic crash."
- **Question:** Is this a biological limit or a deliberate "poison pill" left by the Core?
