# Outstanding Questions & Plot Contradictions: Forgotten Future

This document tracks unresolved narrative threads, potential contradictions, and open questions that need to be addressed to ensure consistency across the Forgotten Future universe.

---

## ✅ Resolved Plot Threads

### 1. Anton Drexler's Location & Presence
- **Resolution:** All Core leadership, including Anton Drexler, moved from the Lunar Pyramid (Cradle Prime) to the desert base (Cradle Zero) by the end of Mission 2. The Moon was significantly harder to inhabit than the terrestrial base, and most leadership now considers the desert base their new official home.

### 2. Rahu's Year 15 AT Deployment Timeline
- **Resolution:** After his breakdown in Mission 1, Rahu underwent a "slow-burn" reset during Mission 2 to sanitize his memory of the 202X Truth. He was redeployed in Mission 3 for the "Northern Shield." He is reliable so long as he is kept away from Lem.

### 3. The "Fire" in Lem's Stasis Dream
- **Resolution:** The "fire" in Chapter 36 is a recursive vision of a massacre—thermal flashes from Gorgon weaponry disintegrating the White Forest. It is not the "Beckoning Fire" from Chapter 41.

### 4. The Existence of Arlo (Maya)
- **Resolution:** Arlo is the reincarnation of the original Water Vessel spirit (known to the Core and Lem as "Maya"). Arlo rejects this name, viewing it as an unproven theory.

### 5. The Core's Strategy regarding Arlo (Maya)
- **Resolution:** The Core was in a stalemate between "Capture/Cryo-sleep" (Containment) and "Kill/Beacon" (Consumption). This led to the Year 22 AT Diplomatic Ultimatum: Arlo must leave the village peacefully or the village will be destroyed.

### 6. The Exemption of the Northern Villages
- **Resolution:** The Core left them alone for years because they feared "unleashing the unknown" (a rogue Maya) without a containment plan. They only acted once Arlo's influence began causing cultural schisms in the Hive Cities.

### 7. The Core's Monolith Control & Propaganda
- **Resolution:** The Core publicly claims to have "liberated" the Moon base and the Monoliths from "Maya." City citizens cheer when Monoliths land. The Core uses the title **"King of the Gorgons"** as a bogeyman, promising that such power will only be held by their "democratic" collective.

### 8. Plan B: Coordinated Strike vs. "Natural" Disaster
- **Resolution:** The Core utilizes a hybrid approach. They use massive orbital pod launches to land a ground army of Tripods and Monoliths, while simultaneously unleashing a direct "orbital fire-strike" to vaporize a village. This allows them to maintain a narrative of "containing a terrorist cell" for the Hive Cities while executing a total scorched-earth policy in the North.

### 9. Cassia Vane's Defection
- **Resolution:** Having witnessed the Core's leadership and the brutal execution of Mission 2 and the Northern Siege, Cassia Vane strips herself of her Archivist status and tech, formally joining Arlo's village. She is the first high-ranking "Core-born" human to defect based on a moral disillusionment.

## ✅ Resolved Plot Threads

### 10. AI Lynn vs. Arlo (Individual Spirit)
- **Resolution:** AI Lynn (the version 15 logic/legacy) remains active in Lem's Aether-Drive and is fully aware of Arlo's spiritual signature. In the aftermath of the orbital strike, AI Lynn autonomously confirms Arlo's reincarnation signature on the Aetheric line. They are separate entities—one is a data-legacy, the other is a spiritual reincarnation—until the **Inception Procedure** results in their merger into the re-awakened identity of **Maya**.

### 11. The Failure of Core Technology at Cradle Zero
- **Context:** Maya is able to dismantle the lab equipment from within.
- **Resolution:** The Core’s facilities at Cradle Zero are built using Synodic technology ("Builders"). This technology recognizes Maya (the Water Vessel) as a primary administrative spirit, allowing her to override the Core's remote controls and dismantle the room's infrastructure to reform her own physical body.

### 12. The Nature of Wood-Water Clusters
- **Resolution:** Following the Great Update, these clusters are blooming as the biological and mechanical systems of the planet begin to merge. They are a physical manifestation of the shared data-legacy and the thinning of the aetheric veil between technology and nature.

### 13. The Selenites' Fate
- **Resolution:** While the Selenites remain physically absent, Dr. Elowen Vane's penance on the Moon involves preserving the records of the indigenous past. The fragmenting Moon is no longer a machine-governed prison, but a drifting library of what was lost.

### 14. Arlo's Identity
- **Resolution:** Arlo remains Arlo. While he feels the pulse of Maya's resonance (the "wisdom of the water") after the Great Update, he persists as an individual human leader, proving that spirits can be anchored in nature without the Core's "perfection."

### 15. The "Analog Interface" Backlash
- **Resolution:** This was confirmed as a "poison pill" fail-safe embedded by the Core to prevent the unencrypted Cataclysm data from being viewed by non-Archives. Lem's Great Update neutralized these subroutines globally.
