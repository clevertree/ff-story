# Forgotten Future: The Story

A Clevertree Production.

This repository contains the narrative foundation and manuscript for **Forgotten Future**, an AI-driven science fiction epic.

## Vision: AI-Driven & Open Source

This is an **AI-Driven Story**. This means the bar for narrative depth, consistency, and descriptive fidelity is set extremely high. We leverage AI to maintain complex world-building "facts," simulate character motivations, and ensure causality is never sacrificed for convenience. All AI involvement follows the [AI Ethics Guidelines](AI_ETHICS.md).

**Current Stage: Manuscript Drafting & Refinement (Phase VI/VII)**
The manuscript has been consolidated and refined for pacing. We are maintaining two distinct versions of the story:
- **Young Adult (YA) Version:** Follows a **Welsian/Clinical** style (see [PLAN_YOUNG_ADULT.md](PLAN_YOUNG_ADULT.md)). This is the primary version currently under development.
- **13+ Version:** A more traditional, heroic narrative for younger audiences (see [PLAN_13_PLUS.md](PLAN_13_PLUS.md)).

**Workflow:**
1. **Phase V (Complete):** Create comprehensive chapter planning documents.
2. **Lore Hardening (Complete):** Resolved plot holes and ambiguities through iterative AI dialogue.
3. **Phase VI (In-Progress):** Generate and refine full prose narrative from chapter plans.
4. **Phase VII (Next):** QA/refinement, final polish, and editorial review.
5. **Release:** First edition hardcopy publication and digital site launch.

## Project Roadmap (Waterfall Phases)

1.  **Phase I: Foundation (The Lore):** ✅ Define the universe "Facts", history, and the state of physics/technology.
2.  **Phase II: Dramatis Personae (The Cast):** ✅ Define characters, motivations, and arcs.
3.  **Phase III: Cartography & Chronology (The Stage):** ✅ Map out settings and the timeline.
4.  **Phase IV: Structural Outline (The Skeleton):** ✅ Divide the story into major Acts/Arcs.
5.  **Phase V: Detail Refinement (The Pulse):** ✅ Complete chapter-by-chapter planning documents.
6.  **Phase VI: Narrative Composition (The Meat):** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** — Drafting the manuscript (32 Chapters).
7.  **Phase VII: Polish & Review (The Skin):** Scheduled after Phase VI completion.

## Manuscript Progress

**Current Stage:** Phase VI — Full Manuscript Draft (32 Chapters)
**Completed:** Consolidation and pacing optimization.

The manuscript has been restructured to **32 chapters** to improve narrative velocity and ensure character beats align with the series finale.

## Story Connections

This story is directly linked to the teaser found in [ff-teaser](../ff-teaser). The events of the destruction of the moon and the arrival of the Tripods are the catalyst for our narrative.
