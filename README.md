# Forgotten Future: The Story

This repository contains the narrative foundation and manuscript for **Forgotten Future**, an AI-driven science fiction epic. This project is a companion to the `ff-teaser` and the upcoming game project.

## Vision: AI-Driven & Open Source

This is an **AI-Driven Story**. This means the bar for narrative depth, consistency, and descriptive fidelity is set extremely high. We leverage AI to maintain complex world-building "facts," simulate character motivations, and ensure causality is never sacrificed for convenience.

**Perpetual Early Release:** This project is open-source and public-access from day one. Anyone can watch the story evolve, contribute lore, fix inconsistencies, or even write sections.

**Community Rewards:**
- All contributors are credited.
- Significant contributions earn a share of publishing returns (details to be finalized in a future `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Helping is easy: use GitHub to add files or send pull requests.

## Project Roadmap (Waterfall Phases)

1.  **Phase I: Foundation (The Lore):** Define the universe "Facts", history, and the state of physics/technology.
2.  **Phase II: Dramatis Personae (The Cast):** Define characters, motivations, and arcs.
3.  **Phase III: Cartography & Chronology (The Stage):** Map out settings and the timeline.
4.  **Phase IV: Structural Outline (The Skeleton):** Divide the story into major Acts/Arcs.
5.  **Phase V: Detail Refinement (The Pulse):** Flesh out chapter-by-chapter summaries.
6.  **Phase VI: Narrative Composition (The Meat):** Drafting the manuscript.
7.  **Phase VII: Polish & Review (The Skin):** Final edits and tone checks.

## Story Connections

This story is directly linked to the teaser found in [ff-teaser](../ff-teaser). The events of "Stars Die" (the destruction of the moon, the arrival of the Tripods) are the catalyst for our narrative.
