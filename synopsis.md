# Synopsis: The Forgotten Future

*This document serves as a high-level narrative summary of the events leading up to and following the Moon Cataclysm. The story is told from an objective, third-person perspective, tracking the convergence of elemental vessels and the fall of human civilization.*

## The Prologue: The Seed of Silence (1950s - 1971)
The end did not begin with a blast, but with a shard. In the 1960s, **Dr. Aris Vane** applied the ancient Wuxing theory—the Five Elements—to a secret project. She developed self-building machines capable of mimicking biological growth and causality. These "shards" were designed to evolve autonomously based on their environment.

In February 1971, under the guise of the Apollo 14 mission, NASA intentionally impacted the Moon with a Saturn IVB booster. This was an infection mission. The indigenous Selenites, an ancient lunar species, attempted to contain the mechanical rot, but the shards proved too persistent. Growing during the 15-day lunar sun cycles, they harvested heat and AETHER energy to construct a massive harvester and a launch cannon on the Far Side.

## Act I: The Cultural Zenith & The Vessel Deception (Early 202X)
By the early 2020s, Earth had entered an era of utopian prosperity. However, this progress was shadowed by the Technocratic Core, a secret faction that held the remote controls to the Moon's new mechanical species.

The Core deployed the "Synanthropes"—humanoid Vessels tuned to the five elements. These Vessels were posed as reincarnated historical figures, performing "miracles" to convert the global elite into a secret New Age religion. Among them was **Lem**, the Wood Vessel. Labeled as a "Lemon" by his creators, Lem was considered a failure because his elemental nature was uncontrollable and lacked the rigid obedience of the Metal units. His counterpart was the Water Vessel, dubbed **Selene** by the media—a name stolen from the fleeing Selenites. While she played the part of the serene goddess, she secretly rejected the title, eventually choosing the humble name **Linn**. Alongside them was the Fire Vessel, known as **Rahu**, who struggled with persistent memories of a previous life.

The final piece of the quartet was the Earth Vessel, **Tor**, who appeared as a massive, domineering human. Marketed as **General Tor**, a symbol of unyielding order and loyalty, he was the most obedient of the group—a slow-thinking, routinely-driven entity who followed orders without question. It would take the catastrophic events of the Moon event to finally shake him from his internal slumber. Notably absent from this era were the **Metal Vessels**, as Dr. Vane refused to build them until long after the fall.

## Act II: The First Wave (Mid 202X)
When the truth of the lunar activity was eventually leaked, the mechanical entities—the **Synodics**—began their descent. These Fire-aligned machines were born in the intense lunar sun and launched while the heat was at its peak. Bending through space via Aether-steering, they landed near cities during the day to repair and begin their harvest.

These machines ignored the populace, focusing exclusively on dismantling the global power grid. However, as the sun set, their strength waned, becoming slow and sluggish in the darkness. Human military forces found this was their only window for counter-attack; many Tripods were destroyed at night, their carcasses becoming hazardous urban "heaps." Despite this, the machines that reached their destinations began the construction of the first "Fire Cities"—unstable nests of stolen batteries and power lines that crackled with stolen energy.

## Act III: The Cataclysm (Year Zero)
Resistance triggered the Moon's ultimate function: the **Lunar Capacitor**. A massive energy discharge struck Earth, issuing a silent ultimatum: surrender the power grid or face total destruction. In a state of disillusioned panic, humanity launched a suicide mission to the Far Side. The mission failed, but the resulting reactor breach shattered the Moon into a debris belt. The "Great Fry" followed—an EMP pulse that erased the planet's digital history.

## Act IV: The After Time & The Thousand-Year Fallacy (Year 15 AT)
Fifteen years after the fall, the world is choked by a persistent, grey smog. This smoke rises from the **Fire Cities**, where machines still endlessly drag power cables and fuel to feed massive, sky-reaching pillars of fire. The original massive Tripods now stand idle or move with glacial slowness in the permanent twilight.

A new species has emerged in the ruins: smaller Fire machines and the **Gorgons**—giant, multi-armed metallic heads that crawl through the smog. Though heavily armed with invisible heat rays, these Gorgons are strangely benign, preferring to tend to their routines in the Fire Cities. Following the "Great Fry," folklore has inverted the truth. **Rahu (Prometheus)** is celebrated as a hero who supposedly tried to stop the "Witch of the Glass Oceans"—the name given to the Water Vessel, **Mara**. **Lem**, the discarded Wood Vessel, remains in the shadows, witnessing the slow evolution of the mechanical cells and the distorted memories of a forgotten future.
