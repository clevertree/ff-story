# Synopsis: The Forgotten Future

*This document serves as a high-level narrative summary of the events leading up to and following the Moon Cataclysm. The story is told from an objective, third-person perspective, tracking the convergence of elemental vessels and the fall of human civilization.*

## The Prologue: The Seed of Silence (1950s - 1971)
The end did not begin with a blast, but with a shard. In the 1960s, a female scientist applied the ancient Wuxing theory—the Five Elements—to a secret project. She developed self-building machines capable of mimicking biological growth and causality. These "shards" were designed to evolve autonomously based on their environment.

In February 1971, under the guise of the Apollo 14 mission, NASA intentionally impacted the Moon with a Saturn IVB booster. This was an infection mission. The indigenous Selenites, an ancient lunar species, attempted to contain the mechanical rot, but the shards proved too persistent. Growing during the 15-day lunar sun cycles, they harvested heat and AETHER energy to construct a massive harvester and a launch cannon on the Far Side.

## Act I: The Cultural Zenith & The Vessel Deception (Early 202X)
By the early 2020s, Earth had entered an era of utopian prosperity. However, this progress was shadowed by the Technocratic Core, a secret faction that held the remote controls to the Moon's new mechanical species.

The Core deployed the "Synanthropes"—humanoid Vessels tuned to the five elements. These Vessels were posed as reincarnated historical figures, performing "miracles" to convert the global elite into a secret New Age religion. Among them was **Lem**, the Wood Vessel. Labeled as a "Lemon" by his creators, Lem was considered a failure because his elemental nature was uncontrollable and lacked the rigid obedience of the Metal units. His counterpart was the Water Vessel, dubbed **Selene** by the media—a name stolen from the fleeing Selenites. Alongside them was the Fire Vessel, known as **Rahu**, who struggled with persistent memories of a previous life.

## Act II: The First Wave (Mid 202X)
When the truth of the lunar activity was eventually leaked, the mechanical entities—dubbed the **Synodics** or **Syzygians** by the public—began their descent. Massive tripods were launched from the Farside Cannon, bending through space via Aether-steering to land near Earth's major cities. These machines ignored the populace, focusing exclusively on dismantling the global power grid. Every human attempt to destroy them resulted in the creation of hazardous urban "carcasses," poisoning the very infrastructure they sought to protect.

## Act III: The Cataclysm (Year Zero)
Resistance triggered the Moon's ultimate function: the **Lunar Capacitor**. A massive energy discharge struck Earth, issuing a silent ultimatum: surrender the power grid or face total destruction. In a state of disillusioned panic, humanity launched a suicide mission to the Far Side. The mission failed, but the resulting reactor breach shattered the Moon into a debris belt. The "Great Fry" followed—an EMP pulse that erased the planet's digital history.

## Act IV: The After Time & The Thousand-Year Fallacy (Year 15 AT)
Fifteen years after the fall, the world exists in a state of lasting darkness. Most survivors hide near the **Glazed Oceans**, avoiding the Synodic patrols that still monitor the ruins. Due to the destruction of digital records and the survival of the *New Chronology* book series, a false history has taken hold: most people believe the Cataclysm happened a thousand years ago, in 102X.

In this dark age, folklore has inverted the truth. **Rahu (Prometheus)** is celebrated as a hero who supposedly tried to stop the "Witch of the Glass Oceans"—the name given to the Water Vessel, **Mara**. **Lem**, the discarded Wood Vessel, remains in the shadows, witnessing the slow evolution of the mechanical cells and the distorted memories of a forgotten future.
