# Synopsis: The Forgotten Future

*This document serves as a high-level narrative summary of the events leading up to and following the Moon Cataclysm. The story is told from an objective, third-person perspective, tracking the convergence of elemental vessels and the fall of human civilization.*

## The Prologue: The Seed of Silence (1950s - 1971)
The end did not begin with a blast, but with a shard. In the 1960s, **Dr. Aris Vane** applied the ancient Wuxing theory—the Five Elements—to a secret project. She developed self-building machines capable of mimicking biological growth and causality. These "shards" were designed to evolve autonomously based on their environment.

In February 1971, under the guise of the Apollo 14 mission, NASA intentionally impacted the Moon with a Saturn IVB booster. This was an infection mission. The indigenous Selenites, an ancient lunar species, attempted to contain the mechanical rot, but the shards proved too persistent. Growing during the 15-day lunar sun cycles, the machines harvested heat and AETHER energy to construct a massive harvester and a launch cannon on the Far Side.

## Act I: The Cultural Zenith & The Vessel Deception (Early 202X)
By the early 2020s, Earth had entered an era of utopian prosperity. This "Decade of Revelation" was marked by a constant flood of once-hidden information—whistleblower leaks about extraterrestrial life, secret terrestrial governments, and ancient prophecies that had been suppressed for centuries. This media saturation was a deliberate tactic by the Technocratic Core; by flooding the public consciousness with conflicting "truths," they ensured that the most critical revelations were constantly overlooked or dismissed as noise until it was too late.

The Core deployed the "Synanthropes"—humanoid Vessels tuned to the five elements. These Vessels were posed as reincarnated historical figures, performing "miracles" to convert the global elite into a secret New Age religion. This movement was cleverly masked within the vague, generic terminology of existing faiths—words like "Savior," "Second Coming," and "The End of the World"—allowing the cult to expand globally without alarming the general public. Central to their indoctrination was the "Prophecy of the King of Terror"—a redacted Nostradamus quatrain that the Core had updated from its original "1999" date to "202X." The Vessels were programmed to provide this prophecy to everyone they met, framing their arrival as a divine inevitability.

Among them—though carefully hidden from the public—was **Lem**, the Wood Vessel. Labeled a "Lemon" by his creators, Lem was considered a failure because his elemental nature was uncontrollable and obstructed the Core's desire for obedience. They buried him in suburban anonymity, raising him as an ordinary human to be activated only if absolutely necessary. His counterpart in the public eye was the Water Vessel, dubbed **Selene** by the media—a name stolen from the fleeing Selenites. While she played the part of the serene goddess, she secretly rejected the title, eventually choosing the humble name **Linn**. Alongside them was the Fire Vessel, known as **Rahu**, who struggled with persistent memories of a previous life.

As the truth of the Vessels' origins began to leak, Rahu and Linn attempted to rebel against their programming and expose the Prophecy as a manufactured Core lie. Rahu broadcast from his lunar exile, while Linn tried to counter the narratives on Earth. The Core's media machine twisted every warning into spectacle. Rahu was branded a volatile villain, while Linn was cast as an "unwilling heroine"—a saintly figure who was supposedly arriving to save humanity from the very apocalypse the Core was initiating. Despite her desperate denials of her divinity, she developed a fanatical following within the military, who viewed her as a miraculous deterrent against the coming dark age.

The final piece of the quartet was the Earth Vessel, **Tor**, who appeared as a massive, domineering human. Marketed as **General Tor**, a symbol of unyielding order and loyalty, he was the most obedient of the group—a slow-thinking, routinely-driven entity who followed orders without question. It would take the catastrophic events of the Moon event to finally shake him from his internal slumber. Notably absent from this era were the **Metal Vessels**, as Dr. Vane refused to build them until long after the fall.

## The Awakening & The Moon Mission (Late 202X)
In his final weeks of anonymity, **Lem** lived an unremarkable suburban life, unaware of his own nature. When the machines appeared on the horizon, Linn arrived at his door and forced his activation, installing a compulsive link to the Aether-Drive—a system of control that would dominate his consciousness. Devastated by the revelation of his artificiality, Lem was drafted into a military strike team and embedded aboard **The Caucasian Eagle**, a capital vessel commanded by **Commander Dr. Iris Novak**, a Core operative embedded in the military hierarchy. The soldiers were fed prepared psychological profiles designed to manage their fear and compliance.

**General Tor** commanded the fleet from his flagship, **Hercules**, broadcasting speeches that invoked the cynical "Prometheus narrative"—framing the mission as heroic resistance. As the fleet approached the Moon, the crew confirmed its true nature: the lunar surface was not natural rock but a constructed apparatus. The machinery was visible; the deception was undeniable.

## Act III: The Cataclysm (Year Zero)
As **The Caucasian Eagle** reached lunar orbit, **Linn**—with terrifying authority—ordered a soldier removed from the ship for a psychological break. **Novak** executed the order, jettisoning him into vacuum. The crew, traumatized, was forced to recalibrate their understanding of command and survival.

Moments later, **Tor** broadcast his final speech from **Hercules**. The Moon began to glow with impossible heat. Massive debris rings spiraled upward from the lunar surface—fragments torn free by forces no human physics could explain. The **Lunar Capacitor**, a device built into the Moon's core, had discharged. **The Caucasian Eagle** was struck by the first wave of debris and crippled, its trajectory pulling it toward the Moon's surface.

**Lem** survived the impact and crashed. In an Aether-Drive fugue, he experienced a dream-state where mission markers and data swirled in his consciousness. A repair vehicle—sent by **Linn**—extracted him from the wreckage. **Novak** emerged to deliver a cryptic message: Lem's Aether-Drive had been "activated and connected to the mission software." His agency—his entire existence—was revealed as architecture. Left alone on the lunar surface with a weaponized hovercraft and mission directives pinging in his consciousness, Lem understood only that his mission continued.

On the lunar surface, Lem joined a strike team of human pilots engaging the base's plasma cannons. The mission seemed hopeless—the pilots were being decimated, the base defenses overwhelming. Then a massive heat signature appeared on the communications net: **Rahu**, the Fire Vessel, exiled to the Moon and now emerging as an active threat. The strike team was pinned down, facing apparent annihilation.

From the Hercules flagship in orbit, **General Tor** made a decision that transcended programming: he would sacrifice the Hercules itself. Breaking through the debris field that had scattered the fleet, the capital ship engaged Rahu directly. The confrontation was violent and catastrophic. The Hercules sustained massive damage and began a descent toward the lunar surface—a descent from which there was no recovery. **Tor** remained at his command bridge, accepting the cost of his own sacrifice.

With Rahu suppressed and the base defenses overwhelmed, the human strike teams gained ground. But the price was absolute: **Tor** had given his life. **Novak**, the Chief Science Officer and Core operative, assumed command of the surviving fleet and issued new directives without pause. There was no time for grief. The mission continued. 

With Rahu suppressed (or so the soldiers believed), the strike force advances toward the center of the alien base. There stands a massive pyramid—a geometric structure of impossible scale and precision. As they approach, the lunar surface itself becomes unstable, seismic and thermal readings spiking dangerously. **Novak** makes the only decision available: evacuation into the pyramid.

The moment the human forces cross the threshold, the pyramid stabilizes. Vibrations cease. Thermal fluctuations dampen. The structure becomes a sanctuary in the midst of apocalyptic collapse. For a moment, the soldiers breathe. They have achieved their objective. They are safe.

Then the door beside **Iris** begins to slam. Something on the outside is striking it with tremendous force. The impacts are violent and relentless. The soldiers, trained and paranoid, back away and raise weapons.

The door gives way. **General Tor** emerges.

He is alive—blackened with ash and debris, but unmistakably alive. He looks like he has just survived a catastrophe. Perhaps he has. The soldiers are shocked. Iris, maintaining composure, asks the question everyone wonders: "General, how did you survive?"

Tor does not answer. He ignores the question entirely and orders the door resealed. Only after the entrance is secured does Iris attempt to recalibrate the mission: "We've secured the base. We've destroyed Rahu. We just need to disable the critical systems."

**Tor interrupts her with a single statement that shatters all understanding: "No. Rahu is still alive. Inside this pyramid. Prepare for battle."**

The revelation hits like a physical shock. Rahu was not destroyed. He is alive. He is inside the very structure they have just entered as sanctuary. The soldiers, and even Iris—selected for this mission specifically because she could absorb impossible contradictions and continue functioning—visibly struggle to process the information. But they do not fall apart. They recover. They acknowledge the order. They begin preparing for a confrontation that none of them understand.

The mission is not ending. It is transforming. Tor's survival raises impossible questions. Rahu's continued existence makes the Hercules' sacrifice something other than victory. And the soldiers realize, slowly and with growing dread, that they are deeper inside the true mission than they have been told.

The **Great Fry** followed—an EMP cascade that erased the planet's digital history. Humanity's technological infrastructure collapsed.

## Act IV: The First Wave (Mid 202X)
When the truth of the lunar activity finally became undeniable, the mechanical entities—the **Synodics**—began their descent. These Fire-aligned machines were born in the intense lunar sun and launched while the heat was at its peak. Bending through space via Aether-steering, they landed near cities during the day to repair and begin their harvest. 

Only in these final moments did the general public begin to grasp the connection between the "aliens" and the secret religion that had been growing in their midst. However, by the time the revelation broke through the media flood, the First Wave had already landed. These machines ignored the populace, focusing exclusively on dismantling the global power grid. However, as the sun set, their strength waned, becoming slow and sluggish in the darkness. Human military forces found this was their only window for counter-attack; many Tripods were destroyed at night, their carcasses becoming hazardous urban "heaps." Despite this, the machines that reached their destinations began the construction of the first "Fire Cities"—unstable nests of stolen batteries and power lines that crackled with stolen energy.

## Act V: The After Time & The Thousand-Year Fallacy (Year 15 AT)
Fifteen years after the fall, the world is choked by a persistent, grey smog. This smoke rises from the **Fire Cities**, where machines still endlessly drag power cables and fuel to feed massive, sky-reaching pillars of fire. The original massive Tripods now stand idle or move with glacial slowness in the permanent twilight.

A new species has emerged in the ruins: smaller Fire machines and the **Gorgons**—giant, multi-armed metallic heads that crawl through the smog. Though heavily armed with invisible heat rays, these Gorgons are strangely benign, preferring to tend to their routines in the Fire Cities. The survivors who call themselves **Archivists** are, in truth, the original Technocratic Core preserving the real timeline while the rest of humanity inherits myth. Following the "Great Fry," folklore has inverted the truth. **Rahu (Prometheus)** is celebrated as a hero who supposedly tried to stop the "Witch of the Glass Oceans"—the name given to the Water Vessel, **Mara**. **Lem**, the discarded Wood Vessel, remains in the shadows, witnessing the slow evolution of the mechanical Synodics and the distorted memories of a forgotten future.
