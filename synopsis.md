# Synopsis: The Forgotten Future (Memoirs of a Modern Lemon)

*This document serves as a high-level narrative summary of the events leading up to and following the Moon Cataclysm. It is written in the style of a memoir, primarily from the perspective of Lem, with occasional accounts from other survivors.*

## The Prologue: The Seed of Silence (1950s - 1971)
The end did not begin with a blast, but with a shard. In the 1960s, a female scientist—whose name has been scrubbed from the digital record but lives in my Aetheric memory—applied the ancient Wuxing theory (the Five Elements) to a secret project: self-building machines that mimicked the causality of life. These "shards" were designed to grow based on their environment.

In February 1971, under the guise of the Apollo 14 mission, a Saturn IVB booster intentionally impacted the Moon. It was an infection mission. The indigenous Selenites, a quiet and ancient people who had long avoided Earth's wars, tried to prune this mechanical rot, but the shards were persistent. They grew during the 15-day lunar sun cycles, harvesting heat and AETHER energy. For decades, they built a massive harvester and a launch cannon on the Far Side.

## Act I: The Cultural Zenith & The Vessel Deception (Early 202X)
By the early 2020s, Earth was a utopian mirage. Renewal and creativity flourished, unaware that a secret faction—The Technocratic Core—held the remote controls to the Moon's new mechanical species. 

To consolidate power, the Core deployed the "Synanthropes"—humanoid Vessels like myself. They posed these Vessels as reincarnated historical figures, performing miracles to convert the global elite into a new-age religion. I was one of them, though I was labeled a "Lemon"—Unit W-01, the Wood Vessel. They considered me a failure because my element was "uncontrollable" and lacked the lethal obedience of the Metal units.

## Act II: The First Wave (Mid 202X)
The truth leaked eventually. When the public learned of the "aliens" on the Moon, the Synodics (or Syzygians, as the crowds called them) began to fall. Massive tripods were launched from the Farside Cannon, bending through space using gravity-assistance to land near our cities. They ignored us, focusing solely on dismantling the power grids. We fought back, but every destroyed tripod became a radioactive "carcass" that poisoned our streets.

## Act III: The Cataclysm (Year Zero)
When we resisted, the Moon revealed its final form: a Capacitor. A massive blinding blast of energy struck Earth. The ultimatum was clear: surrender the power or lose the planet. 

In a fit of disillusioned desperation, humanity launched a suicide mission to the Far Side. It was a massacre. The mission failed, but it triggered a reactor breach that shattered the Moon into thousands of fragments. The "Great Fry" followed—an EMP pulse that erased our digital history.

## Act IV: The After Time & The Thousand-Year Fallacy (Year 15 AT)
Now, the world is a shard of its former self. Most of us hide in the shadows of the Glazed Oceans, avoiding the Synodics that still patrol the ruins. Due to the "Great Fry" and a surviving series of alternate-history books called *'New Chronology'*, most people now believe the Cataclysm happened a thousand years ago, in 102X. They call the 21st century an ancient myth.

Only a few of us recall the truth. Rahu—the one the media called "Prometheus"—still haunts the Aether with his guilt. And I, the "Lemon," remain. A useless servant of a dead element, writing this account so that the future might remember why the stars dived into blinding skies.
