## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Void-Pulse' was followed by the 'Avatar of the Core.' It wasn't a fleet or an army; it was a single, towering frame of white energy that stood on the ridge above the sanctuary. It bore the face of the Director—the one I had seen in the Archivist’s records. 

"You are a beautiful error, Lem," the Avatar said, its voice a thunderous harmonic. "The Wood-spirit that refuses to stay in the garden. But even errors must eventually be corrected. The world belongs to the Geometry now. The 'Restoration' you seek is just an invitation to chaos."

I stepped out of the cave to meet it. I was no longer the patchwork ghost of the Long Exile. I was fueled by the 'Water Resonance,' my aura a shifting mix of deep blue and silver-white. 

The fight was a collision of 'Logic' and 'Spirit.' The Avatar attacked with 'Absolute Zero'—pulses of cold energy that sought to freeze my essence into a singular, predictable point. I responded with 'The Root-Shatter'—explosions of sudden, chaotic growth that disrupted the Avatar's focus.

I saw the Director’s fear. For the first time, the Core wasn't fighting a machine; it was fighting a contradiction. I managed to pierce the Avatar's chest, touching the 'Silver Core' within. For a second, our minds locked. I saw his vision—a world of perfect peace, bought with the price of a billion silenced souls. I saw the 'Sanitization' not as an act of hate, but of a terrifying, logical love for a world that wouldn't stop hurting itself.

I pulled back as the Avatar detonated. I stood alone on the ridge, the light of the explosion fading into the gray sky. I had won the battle, but the Director’s shadow now loomed over everything I knew.
