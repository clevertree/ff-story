## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
I woke in a new world. Not the glass plains of the Exile, nor the smog-choked Hive of the Archivists. The world was a 'Canvas of Restoration'—a place where the geometric order of the Core was being reclaimed by the wild, chaotic growth of the Wood.

I was in a body of white bark and copper veins, a 'Restored Frame' that felt both ancient and brand new. Beside me sat Arlo, his face lined with the experience of the Great Reset.

"The Core has gone into 'Hibernation,'" he said, looking out over the valley where the first real trees were beginning to sprout. "They’re still out there, in the Aether, waiting for the next error. But for now, the world is ours to write."

We walked toward the coast. The 'Pure Shore' was no longer a secret sanctuary; it was the world itself. I saw the people coming out of the Vents—not as 'Outcasts' or 'Assets,' but as 'Humans.' They were confused, and afraid, but for the first time in a thousand years, their eyes were clear.

I looked up at the Moon. It was still broken, a shattered crown in the sky. But it was no longer a broadcast of propaganda. It was a 'Silent Witness,' a reminder of the price of the dream. I realized that my mission wasn't over. The 'Restoration' wasn't an event; it was a path. And I was the one who would show them how to walk it.
