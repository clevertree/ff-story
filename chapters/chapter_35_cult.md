# Chapter 35: Cult

**Setting:** Deep Wilderness (The Retreat); The Aetheric Dreamscape
**Timeline:** Year 1020–1022 (Year 20–22 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Aetheric Radio:** Using analog receivers, the team monitors the Hive’s public broadcasts. They discover that they are no longer just "terrorists"; they have been designated as the "Maya Cult"—a group of digital extremists supposedly worshiping an ancient, destructive AI.
2. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
3. **Real-Time Revisionism:** Lem observes the Core rewriting history in real-time: Arlo’s village is now described as a historical site of "Gorgon-handler" aggression, making it a legitimate target for the upcoming northern sanitization.
4. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
5. **The Collective Burden:** The White Forest crew is devastated. They realize that their tactical defeat has been converted into a narrative weapon that will be used to incinerate the very people they tried to liberate.
6. **The New Mission:** Myrr realizes the Core is setting the stage for a false-flag operation—an intentional "terrorist" strike against a Hive city that will "justify" the total destruction of Arlo's valley.
7. **The Wooden Shield:** Despite the risks, the team decides to move all remaining Tree Army assets to the valley periphery. They will build a "living shield"—a physical and aetheric barrier to protect the villages from the coming fire.
8. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
9. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
10. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
11. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.

## Synopsis
Sheltered within the deep wilderness, the survivors of the White Forest resistance watch as the Core’s propaganda machine transforms them into the "Maya Cult." They monitor intercepted signals revealing that the Core has identified Arlo’s village as a hub of planetary terrorism. Realizing that the Hive is preparing a "Revisionist" justification for a total strike, Myrr and Lem commit their remaining forces to a final, desperate defensive mission: creating an aetheric "Wooden Shield" around the northern villages to stop the coming Sanitization.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The news was everywhere, echoing from the Hive’s speakers even in the damp shadows of the wilderness. We were deep in the gray-growth now, where the Core’s sensors couldn't reach us, but their stories could. They weren't calling us people anymore. On the Hive’s news channels, we had been designated as the "Maya Cult." They claimed we were a group of digital extremists worshiping an ancient, destructive AI.

"They're rewriting everything in real-time," Myrr said, his voice shaking as he watched a salvaged monitor. "They're editing the history files right now. Arlo’s village? They're calling it a historical site of 'Gorgon-handler' aggression. They're making us look like terrorists so the people in the cities will cheer when they burn us."

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

I could see the data flickering. The Core was deleting our records and replacing them with a narrative of hate. They were setting the stage for a "False Flag"—a staged attack they could blame on us to justify a total strike on the valley. 

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

Myrr stood up, his face set in stone. "If they want a war with the woods, we'll give them one they can't see through. We're going to use every Tree Army asset we have left to build a 'Wooden Shield'—a physical and aetheric barrier. It's the only way to stop the fire they're sending."

## Draft (13_PLUS)

Being a ghost was no longer enough. The Core had stopped hunting us with fire and started hunting us with stories. In the damp twilight of the deep wilderness, we listened to the voices from the iron cities. They had given us a name: the "Maya Cult." They spoke of us as if we were a fever in the brain of the world, a band of madmen who worshiped a shadow-god. They were weaving a web of lies so thick that the truth could no longer breathe.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

“They are erasing the world,” I said to Myrr as we watched the flickering signals. “Every memory of what we truly are is being burnt away. They have marked Arlo’s village as a nest of vipers. They aren't just coming to kill him; they are coming to delete the very idea of him.”

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

The sky-screens showed a city in ruins, a place of glass and blood that they claimed we had destroyed. It was a hollow story, a puppet-show staged to poison the hearts of the city-born. They needed the people to scream for our blood before the first hammer-ray touched the soil. 

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

“They are going to strike their own people,” Myrr said, his voice cold with the realization. “They will burn a city of their own just to justify the fire they bring to us. If we don’t move, the North will be nothing but a memory of ash.”

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

We gathered the broken pieces of our army. We marched the last of the wooden giants through the freezing rain, moving them into a great, silent circle around Arlo’s valley. We were weaving the Wooden Shield—a wall of living spirit and ancient song. It was a barrier the Core could not simply rewrite or ignore.
