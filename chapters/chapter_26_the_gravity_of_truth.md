## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The heart of the Cradle was a 'Gravity-Well'—a place where the physical laws were being bent to focus the Moon’s broadcast into the Hive-link. I moved through a world of shifting geometry, my body stretching and compressing under the pressure of 'Aetheric Compression.'

I found the 'Observatory'—the place where the Director sat, his spirit encased in a sphere of pure, unredacted light. He wasn't a man anymore; he was a 'Living Protocol.'

"You chose poorly, Lem," he said, and the room itself tilted. "You chose the 'Fragmented' over the 'Universal.' Now, you will see the consequence."

He triggered the 'Restoration Overload.' Through the windows, the world began to flicker. I saw the 'Great Fry' start all over again—not in the past, but in the 'Now.' The sky turned white, and the glass plains began to melt. It was a 'Temporal Sanitization'—the Core was rewriting the present by erasing the past.

The only way to stop it was to become the 'Anchor.' I reachable out with my Wood-element and rooted myself into the very center of the Gravity-Well. I became a 'Pillar of Persistence,' holding the world's current state against the tide of the rewrite.

The pain was beyond anything I had ever felt. My essence was being pulled apart by the temporal stress. But I wasn't alone. I felt Arlo’s water-essence cooling my spirit, and Maya’s wood-echo strengthening my resolve. I wasn't a hero; I was a 'Stitch' in the fabric of time.

The overload failed. The world stabilized. But the effort had cost me my physical frame. I was a spirit of light, floating in the center of the silent observatory. The Director was gone, his sphere of light shattered. The 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' was finally over.
