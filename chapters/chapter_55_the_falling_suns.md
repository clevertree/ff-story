## Chapter Outline

1.  **Advance into the Plain:** The machine army is miles into the valley when Lem's surveillance equipment picks up a signal—not from the base, but from the lunar sky.
2.  **The Falling Suns:** Multiple objects launch from the Moon. Within minutes, fireballs flare up in the atmosphere, growing into mini-suns that head directly for the arsenal's location.
3.  **The Impact:** The pods strike the sand with world-shaking force. Several are direct hits on the Tree Army, vaporizing entire clusters of monoliths in thermal plumes.
4.  **The Birth of the Monoliths:** From the massive pods—much larger than those seen in the Cataclysm—emerge the original Synodic Monoliths. These are "born" in the moment of landing, fully armed and performing instant system checks.
5.  **The Armed Giants:** Unlike the "Headless Striders" of the resistance, these are the Core's perfection of the Synodic form—brimming with Fire-aligned weaponry and high-density plating.
6.  **The Symmetric War:** A massive engagement erupts. Lem remote-controls the Tree Army, attempting to disable the Sky-Monoliths, but it quickly becomes clear they are evenly matched. The Wood/Water technology can hold the line, but it cannot push through to the base.
7.  **The Deadlock:** The plain becomes a landscape of plasma fire and splintered wood. Myrr and Lem realize that a prolonged battle here will never reach the leadership.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Tactician's Shock:** Lem realizes he underestimated the speed of lunar redeployment. The Core is willing to "risk meteorites" to protect the base.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Lunar Drop-Pods:** The primary delivery system for the Core's heavy armor.
-   **Sky-Monoliths:** The evolved, combat-oriented version of the lunar "Builders."

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Birth" of the monoliths from the pods should be described as a rapid, terrifying unfolding of metal and heat.
-   The visual contrast between the "Natural" wood-grain machines and the "Gleaming" fire-metal monoliths should be the center of the battle's aesthetic.
