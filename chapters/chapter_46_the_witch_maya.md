## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Hidden Signature:** Throughout the long hours of discourse with the villagers, Lem has been running a quiet realization. His "Spiritual Resonance" memory—the same one Myrr used to find Maya—has been pinging a 99.9% match on Arlo's spiritual frequency.
2.  **The Impossible Truth:** Lem is internally paralyzed. The "Witch Maya" he was sent to find—the original spirit of the Water Vessel—is not a feminine figure in the woods, but Arlo himself. Whether through reincarnation or a spirit-migration Lem doesn't yet understand, the "Water" soul is anchored in the village leader.
3.  **The Stalling Tactic:** Lem spends several days in the village, observing Arlo's leadership. He is trying to decide if it is ethical or safe to reveal the truth. He knows that telling Arlo will shatter the human identity Arlo has spent a decade building.
4.  **The Final Decision:** Realizing that the mission to destroy the Core is impossible without the Water Vessel's unique capabilities, Lem decides he must act.
5.  **The Private Invitation:** Lem asks Arlo to speak with him in private. The atmosphere is tense; Arlo senses that the "Remarkable Story" Lem told the village was missing its most important chapter.
6.  **The Mission Proposition:** Lem gets straight to the point: he needs Arlo to leave the village and join him on a mission of absolute importance—the destruction of the Technocratic Core.
7.  **Arlo's Confusion:** Arlo is blindsided. He has spent his life protecting these five villages, believing his sacrifice was local. He doesn't understand why a "Wood Vessel" needs a human leader for a cosmic mission.
8.  **The Reveal of the "Key":** Lem reveals the existence of the human interface link he has been carrying. He explains that it can bridge the gap between human biological memory and the Aether-Drive archives.
9.  **The Identity Bomb:** Lem tells Arlo the truth: "You aren't just a leader, Arlo. You are the spirit of the Water Vessel—the one they called Maya. You are the one who survived the Cataclysm when Lynn could not."
10. **The Skeptic's Defense:** Arlo rejects the name. He regards the "revelation" as a theory, unproven despite Lem's convincing causality. He insists that his name is Arlo, and that there could always be "another version of the truth."
11. **The Choice of Memory:** Lem offers Arlo the interface device. He explains that if Arlo puts it on, he will see the memories of who he might have been *before*—the life of the Water Vessel, the truth of the Moon, and the power he has forgotten.
12. **The Villagers' Backlash:** As Lem demonstrates how he can form the vessel from his own hands (using the particles he brought from the "Bloomed" forest), the villagers are horrified. It is a visceral reminder that Lem is artificial, a living violation of their laws. The trust Arlo has placed in him is pushed to its breaking point.
13. **Arlo's Decision:** After a long, agonizing period of reflection, Arlo reaches a conclusion. He still doesn't accept that he *is* Maya, but he trusts Lem's sincerity enough to investigate the "simulation." 
14. **The Conditions of the Experiment:** Arlo agrees to the procedure under two non-negotiable conditions:
    - **Exile for the Experiment:** He and Lem must leave the village to perform the link. He will not bring this "ghost technology" inside their home.
    - **Total De-activation:** All technology, including the HID and any other aetheric signatures, must be kept far from the village periphery.
15. **Meeting the Crew:** Arlo expresses a desire to meet the "White Forest Inhabitants" Lem spoke of, realizing that his own struggle for survival is part of a much larger, global resistance.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Manipulator?** Lem feels a heavy guilt. He is doing exactly what Lynn once did to him—dragging a "human" into a cosmic conflict they didn't ask for.
-   **Law-Breaker:** Lem realizes that his mere existence is an affront to the village's sanctuary, despite his good intentions.

### Arlo
-   **Identity Integrity:** Arlo refuses to let a technological "simulation" rewrite his humanity. He maintains his name and history as his primary reality.
-   **The Pragmatic Leader:** Even in the face of a world-shattering revelation, his first priority remains the safety and legal integrity of his village.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Technological Taboo:** The visceral human reaction to aetheric manifestation.
-   **The Patch of Five Laws:** How the ban on technology is not just practical, but a fundamental moral pillars of their society.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Spiritual Resonance" HUD should be described as a persistent, flickering icon in Lem's vision, growing steadier as he gets closer to Arlo.
-   The transition from the public "discourse" to the private "revelation" should feel intimate and high-stakes.
-   Focus on the physical sensation of the Interface Device—it should look like a piece of salvaged jewelry or a headband, deceptively simple for such a powerful tool.
