# Chapter 5: Monitor

**Setting:** Spacecraft interior and boarding facility; Earth/Ascent
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day -1 → Day 0

## Synopsis
Aboard the hovering transport and later the mission spacecraft, Lem is boarded as a "citizen monitor," a role Lynn uses to bypass authority restrictions while keeping him close. As the ship launches using recently declassified anti-gravity technology, Lem watches the Earth and the ruins of his home recede below. Moving through the massive interior, he eavesdrops on soldiers grumbling about the "business-influenced" strike order that sacrificed residential areas to save downtown skyscrapers. He observes their resolve shift from cynicism back to their mission as they brace for psychological attacks from the enemy lunar base. At this stage, Lem perceives the Core’s narrative as absolute and flawless, finding no room for doubt in the mission’s necessity.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Hovering Transition:** Lem is transferred from the hover-transport to the primary military vessel. Lynn facilitates his entry as a "citizen monitor," bypassing the standard military restrictions.
2. **The Marshall's Inquiry:** A military marshal confronts Lem over his lack of a briefing and civilian status, but Lynn's authority ensures his passage.
3. **The Grumbling Soldiers:** Lem eavesdrops on a group of soldiers joking cynically about the strike order. They suggest it was influenced by business interests downtown who wanted to save their insured skyscrapers at the cost of the residential suburbs. 
4. **Shift of Resolve:** Before getting cut off by a superior, one soldier suggests that the new unified world government must have had to largely compromise on ethics to achieve it's unity. The soldiers turn their focus back to the mission, their professional discipline overriding their cynicism.
5. **The Machine's Scale:** Lem moves through the ship, observing its massive scale and the application of classified anti-gravity technology that he previously thought was science fiction.
6. **Final Rituals:** The ship undergoes final preparations. The launch itself is marked by the strange physics of the anti-gravity drive.
7. **Ascent and the View Below:** As the ship climbs, Lem watches Earth recede. The loping forms of the Monoliths are visible as tiny specks converging on the city.
8. **Physical Strain:** Within the crowded interior, Lem observes the crew's surface confidence masking underlying tension and psychological strain.
9. **Recall of the Briefing:** Soldiers begin discussing the psychological briefing Lem never received on propaganda distribution, warning of the enemy's ability to manipulate belief and disrupt command structure.
10. **Psy-Op Categories:** Lem eavesdrops on descriptions of the two expected psy-op categories—psychological attacks expected from the enemy. One is a deceptive fabrication (a falsehood designed to look like a revelation) and the other is a demoralizing revelation (a real secret revealed to destroy morale). Lem notes that the Core's narrative currently appears perfect and beyond reproach.
11. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
12. **The Weight of the Briefing:** A specific, terrifying truth mentioned in the briefing about the lunar surface dominates the soldiers' fear and sets an ominous tone.
13. **The Obarchive Functions:** Lem listens to fragments of conversations and physical details of equipment, gathering mission intelligence while his civilian status causes soldiers to ignore him.
14. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
15. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
16. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
17. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
18. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The mission spacecraft’s interior was pressurized. I proceeded through the primary corridor-network. A military marshal initiated a security-stop, citing my civilian attire and absence of a briefing-code on his handheld console. The marshal noted a potential protocol violation regarding my age and clearance status. I offered no verbal response.

My consciousness was prioritized for data-collection and observation. I recorded the structural configuration of the vessel. BIOS-indicators for fear remained suppressed beneath mission-priority directives. My role was designated as a "Citizen Monitor."

The AI Lynn unit utilized the comm-link to verify my status with the marshal. Her authorization bypassed standard command channels. The marshal terminated the security-stop. Lynn directed me to assume a position within the troop-quarters to record personnel conduct. She confirmed my inclusion in the lunar assault mission.

Onboard sensors detected ozone and hydraulic outgassing. Acoustic data recorded a constant low-frequency hum throughout the hull. Lighting was maintained at high-contrast mission levels.

The vessel’s scale exceeded standard military transport norms. Structural elements incorporated classified anti-gravity propulsion manifolds. Technical personnel completed final pre-launch sequences on the gantry-ways. Engine initialization produced high-frequency mechanical vibrations.

Launch was executed via anti-gravity drive. Inertial dampeners localized the force to the floor-deck. Visual sensors recorded a rapid increase in altitude. Monolith units were observed on the horizon, maintaining their converged trajectory toward city sectors.

The drive operates by generating a localized distortion in the planetary aetheric/gravitational field. This neutralized the vessel’s mass relative to the Earth’s gravity-well. This represents a functional application of declassified anti-gravity physics.

I positioned myself in the troop bay to monitor personnel. A senior non-commissioned officer exhibited minor motor-function tremors while inspecting equipment. Personnel were equipped with experimental high-output rifles featuring external wiring and canister-reloads. The hardware appeared to be in a late-stage prototype phase.

Personnel discussed the "Propaganda Distribution" briefing protocols. They identified two primary categories of expected psychological offensive: 1) Deceptive Fabrications (high-complexity falsehoods designed for discovery) and 2) Demoralizing Revelations (high-impact factual data intended to compromise unit morale). Current data-integrity assessments indicate that the Core’s mission-narrative remains internally consistent and logically sound.

At T+45:00, the vessel achieved a high-orbital position. Mission transition was complete. I continued to collect data on personnel and equipment specifications. My civilian status inhibited soldier engagement, facilitating data-collection. Private Miller was observed performing redundant maintenance on optical gear. Subject displayed high levels of cognitive dissociation.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The transition from the hovering transport to the primary vessel was seamless, a mechanical dance I only half-understood. I was boarded as a "citizen monitor," a title that felt like a flimsy shield. A military marshal blocked the gantry, his face a map of confusion as he looked at my civilian clothes. He barked questions at me—demanding my code, my name, my purpose. I didn't answer. I didn't have the words for the mystery that had claimed me.

Lynn’s voice cut through the marshal’s comms before he could detain me. I could see the shift in his expression—fear, then a begrudging acceptance. He stepped aside, his hand snapping to a salute that acknowledged an authority I was only starting to comprehend. "Watch everything, Lem," Lynn’s voice whispered in my mind. "The soldiers, the machines, the fear."

I found a corner near a group of infantrymen. They were older than me, scarred and weary, but they were talking in low, jagged sentences that caught my attention.

"They finally declassified the gravity drives," one soldier said, patting the bulkhead. "Guess it's easier to share the toys when the world's on fire."

"Toys?" another man spat, a cynical grin on his face. "Did you see the strike order? They dropped that Monolith right on the suburbs. My sister lived three blocks from there."

"They had to take it down," the first soldier replied, though his voice lacked conviction.

"Yeah, funny how the downtown skyscrapers are still standing, though. I heard the big offices downtown put the squeeze on Unified Command. Better to erase a few thousand houses than lose the insured real estate, right?"

The others laughed—a dry, angry sound. I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the ship's climate control. They knew. They saw the same things I did, even if they were the ones carrying the rifles. But as the engines began to hum—a bone-deep vibration that signaled the final ritual of launch—their posture shifted. The jokes died away, replaced by the practiced, administrative efficiency of men going to war. Their resolve was turning back toward the enemy, the cynicism shelved for the sake of the mission.

The launch didn't feel like a rocket. There was no fire, only a low, bone-deep hum that made my teeth ache as the anti-gravity drive engaged. We weren't fighting gravity; we were ignoring it. I watched through a tiny, reinforced viewport as the city fell away. The skyscrapers became toys, then specks, and finally, just gray stains on the map of a world that was already burning. On the horizon, I could see them—the Monoliths—moving like spiders across the suburbs. They were small from up here, but the smoke rising behind them was a reminder of the power they wielded.

I sat in my corner, ignored by the soldiers who were too busy wrestling with their own ghosts. They spoke in hushed sentences about propaganda distribution and the psy-op categories—the digital weapons the Moon-base would turn against their minds. These were the expected psychological attacks: a decorative fabrication—a lie dressed in the clothes of a secret, designed to lure a soldier into a false sense of insight—and a demoralizing revelation—a truth so devastating it would sever a man's tether to his duty. They were terrified of what they might find in the dark, but as I sat there, I saw no cracks in the Core’s armor. The mission was righteous, the narrative was solid, and the enemy was a wall of shadow waiting to be breached. I didn't know then that the most dangerous lie is the one that has no holes.
