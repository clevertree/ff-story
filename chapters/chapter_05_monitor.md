# Chapter 5: Monitor

**Setting:** Spacecraft interior and boarding facility; Earth/Ascent
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day -1 → Day 0

## Synopsis
Aboard the hovering transport and later the mission spacecraft, Lem is boarded as a "citizen monitor," a role Lynn uses to bypass authority restrictions while keeping him close. As the ship launches using recently declassified anti-gravity technology, Lem watches the Earth and the ruins of his home recede below. Moving through the massive interior, he eavesdrops on soldiers grumbling about the "business-influenced" strike order that sacrificed residential areas to save downtown skyscrapers. He observes their resolve shift from cynicism back to their mission as they brace for psychological attacks from the enemy lunar base. At this stage, Lem perceives the Core’s narrative as absolute and flawless, finding no room for doubt in the mission’s necessity.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Hovering Transition:** Lem is transferred from the hover-transport to the primary military vessel. Lynn facilitates his entry as a "citizen monitor," bypassing the standard military restrictions.
2. **The Marshall's Inquiry:** A military marshal confronts Lem over his lack of a briefing and civilian status, but Lynn's authority ensures his passage.
3. **The Grumbling Soldiers:** Lem eavesdrops on a group of soldiers joking cynically about the strike order. They suggest it was influenced by business interests downtown who wanted to save their insured skyscrapers at the cost of the residential suburbs. 
4. **Shift of Resolve:** Before getting cut off by a superior, one soldier suggests that the new unified world government must have had to largely compromise on ethics to achieve it's unity. The soldiers turn their focus back to the mission, their professional discipline overriding their cynicism.
5. **The Machine's Scale:** Lem moves through the ship, observing its massive scale and the application of classified anti-gravity technology that he previously thought was science fiction.
6. **Final Rituals:** The ship undergoes final preparations. The launch itself is marked by the strange physics of the anti-gravity drive.
7. **Ascent and the View Below:** As the ship climbs, Lem watches Earth recede. The loping forms of the Monoliths are visible as tiny specks converging on the city.
8. **Physical Strain:** Within the crowded interior, Lem observes the crew's surface confidence masking underlying tension and psychological strain.
9. **Recall of the Briefing:** Soldiers begin discussing the psychological briefing Lem never received on propaganda distribution, warning of the enemy's ability to manipulate belief and disrupt command structure.
10. **Psy-Op Categories:** Lem eavesdrops on descriptions of the two expected psy-op categories—psychological attacks expected from the enemy. One is a deceptive fabrication (a falsehood designed to look like a revelation) and the other is a demoralizing revelation (a real secret revealed to destroy morale). Lem notes that the Core's narrative currently appears perfect and beyond reproach.
11. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
12. **The Weight of the Briefing:** A specific, terrifying truth mentioned in the briefing about the lunar surface dominates the soldiers' fear and sets an ominous tone.
13. **The Obarchive Functions:** Lem listens to fragments of conversations and physical details of equipment, gathering mission intelligence while his civilian status causes soldiers to ignore him.
14. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
15. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
16. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
17. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
18. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The ship smelled of recycled air and cold metal, and I was already inside. I moved through the narrow corridors. A military marshal blocked my way, looking first at my civilian clothes and then at his tablet interface to ask for my briefing code. He noted that my presence was a protocol violation and asked why a teenager was on a high-security launch. I didn't answer.

My internal psychological state was one of cold focus. I felt like I was watching myself from a distance, a separate entity navigating this maze of steel. The fear of the unknown was there, but it was buried under a layer of professional curiosity that I didn't recognize as my own. I wasn't just Lem anymore; I was a recorder.

Lynn's voice crackled in my earpiece, her authority bypassing the ship's chain of command with clinical efficiency. She spoke to the marshal, her words sharp and professional, and he stepped aside without another word. Then she spoke to me, telling me to find a position among the soldiers, to stay quiet, and to observe the personnel's conduct. She informed me that I was now part of the assault mission and to obey any orders given.

The sensory impact of the launch facility was overwhelming. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and hydraulic fluid. A constant, low-frequency hum vibrated through the floor, a sound that felt like the earth itself was protesting our departure. The lighting was harsh and clinical, casting long, distorted shadows across the metal bulkheads.

I moved through the ship, observing its massive scale. Support beams and heavy cables stretched into the shadows of the ceiling. The application of classified anti-gravity technology was evident in the way the interior was constructed. The final rituals of preparation were underway. Technicians in white jumpsuits were scurrying across gantry-ways, their voices lost in the mechanical roar. The engines began to hum with a low vibration that I could feel in my teeth.

We launched. There was no roar of fire, just the strange physics of the anti-gravity drive as it engaged. The floor pressed against my boots. I watched the city through a small viewport as it got smaller, falling away into the haze. On the horizon, I could see the monoliths. They looked like tiny, loping insects now, converging on the city grids.

The anti-gravity drive functioned by creating a localized distortion in the aetheric field. It didn't push us away from the earth; it simply made us no longer part of its weight. It was a terrifying, beautiful application of the Wuxing laws that the Core had mastered.

I sat in a corner and listened to the soldiers. They were veterans, but I saw the physical strain behind their confidence. A sergeant’s hands trembled as he checked his gear, and he repeatedly tapped the magazine of his rifle against the bulkhead. They were carrying oversized, experimental rifles that looked like they had been welded together in a workshop. They were heavy, clunky things with exposed wiring and thick canisters attached to the sides.

A religious reflection from the city's outskirts echoed in my mind. *The sky is the only mirror that does not lie.* It felt like a warning as we climbed higher.

The soldiers began discussing a psychological briefing on propaganda distribution that I had never received. They spoke about the psy-op categories—the psychological weapons they expected the enemy at the moon base to use against their minds. The first was a deceptive fabrication, a trap where the lunar base would feed us a secret that felt real, something we’d have to "hack" or "discover" so that we’d trust it more than our own mission. The second was a demoralizing revelation, where the enemy would give us a piece of reality so heavy it would break our morale. To me, it sounded like a warning of a nightmare, but looking at the crisp displays and the steady orders of the officers, I couldn't imagine a hole in the Core's story. Everything was logical, everything was firm.

We had been in the air for forty-five minutes, the Earth already a curving blue arc below. The situational shift was absolute; we were no longer of the world, but of the mission.

I listened to fragments of conversations about the actual conditions on the Moon. Because I was a civilian, the soldiers ignored me, allowing me to gather mission intelligence while I maintained my place among the personnel. I watched every detail of their equipment and their growing dread. A background character, a young private named Miller, was obsessively cleaning his goggles, his eyes fixed on nothing. He looked like he was already gone.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The transition from the hovering transport to the primary vessel was seamless, a mechanical dance I only half-understood. I was boarded as a "citizen monitor," a title that felt like a flimsy shield. A military marshal blocked the gantry, his face a map of confusion as he looked at my civilian clothes. He barked questions at me—demanding my code, my name, my purpose. I didn't answer. I didn't have the words for the mystery that had claimed me.

Lynn’s voice cut through the marshal’s comms before he could detain me. I could see the shift in his expression—fear, then a begrudging acceptance. He stepped aside, his hand snapping to a salute that acknowledged an authority I was only starting to comprehend. "Watch everything, Lem," Lynn’s voice whispered in my mind. "The soldiers, the machines, the fear."

I found a corner near a group of infantrymen. They were older than me, scarred and weary, but they were talking in low, jagged sentences that caught my attention.

"They finally declassified the gravity drives," one soldier said, patting the bulkhead. "Guess it's easier to share the toys when the world's on fire."

"Toys?" another man spat, a cynical grin on his face. "Did you see the strike order? They dropped that Monolith right on the suburbs. My sister lived three blocks from there."

"They had to take it down," the first soldier replied, though his voice lacked conviction.

"Yeah, funny how the downtown skyscrapers are still standing, though. I heard the big offices downtown put the squeeze on Unified Command. Better to erase a few thousand houses than lose the insured real estate, right?"

The others laughed—a dry, angry sound. I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the ship's climate control. They knew. They saw the same things I did, even if they were the ones carrying the rifles. But as the engines began to hum—a bone-deep vibration that signaled the final ritual of launch—their posture shifted. The jokes died away, replaced by the practiced, administrative efficiency of men going to war. Their resolve was turning back toward the enemy, the cynicism shelved for the sake of the mission.

The launch didn't feel like a rocket. There was no fire, only a low, bone-deep hum that made my teeth ache as the anti-gravity drive engaged. We weren't fighting gravity; we were ignoring it. I watched through a tiny, reinforced viewport as the city fell away. The skyscrapers became toys, then specks, and finally, just gray stains on the map of a world that was already burning. On the horizon, I could see them—the Monoliths—moving like spiders across the suburbs. They were small from up here, but the smoke rising behind them was a reminder of the power they wielded.

I sat in my corner, ignored by the soldiers who were too busy wrestling with their own ghosts. They spoke in hushed sentences about propaganda distribution and the psy-op categories—the digital weapons the Moon-base would turn against their minds. These were the expected psychological attacks: a decorative fabrication—a lie dressed in the clothes of a secret, designed to lure a soldier into a false sense of insight—and a demoralizing revelation—a truth so devastating it would sever a man's tether to his duty. They were terrified of what they might find in the dark, but as I sat there, I saw no cracks in the Core’s armor. The mission was righteous, the narrative was solid, and the enemy was a wall of shadow waiting to be breached. I didn't know then that the most dangerous lie is the one that has no holes.
