# Chapter 21: Emissary

**Setting:** The White Forest (Northern Sector); Analog Sanctuary
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT) (Third Mission)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Cradle Reawakening:** Lem wakes up in a specialized "Deep-Cold" frame. His memories of the remote detonation in the Northern village are intact. 
2. **The Worried Handler:** Cassia is there to greet him again, although she isn't smiling as usual. Lem gathers that she had a difficult talk with Anton who is now convinced that Lem is unreliable. 
3. **The Moral Compromise:** She says the only reason Lem is not in permanent stasis right now is because she convinced Anton to let him go on a mission that didn't involve Gorgons. She argued it wasn't fair to make Lem destroy his former Fire City slaves. 
4. **The Final Ultimatum:** Anton had to agree on that one point, but made it clear if he fails Mission 3 (the Northern Shield) he's done. 
5. **The Missing Legion:** Lem notices that only a few soldiers will accompany him on this mission because they have all been deployed with Rahu to the remaining northern village sites. Lem learns that Rahu has returned to the missions, but is clearly being kept away from Lem. Rahu appears to be loyal and effective once again, returning to his hero status as he liberates all the northern villages from the 'alien' threat and allows them to bulid the megacities they desire. The northern shield missions will go on without lem.
6. **The Vague Directive:** Cassia admits the details of the mission are vague; the objective is to seek out the inhabitants of the White Forest and deliver a message offering them ambassadorship with the Core cities. 
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem re-awakens in a "Deep-Cold" frame, specialized for low-temperature environments. He is greeted by a sombre Cassia Vane, who reveals that she had to fight for his existence after his "hesitation" in the Northern village. She argues that forcing Lem to slaughter his former Fire City peers (Gorgons) is morally indefensible, a tactic that successfully persuaded Anton Drexler to reassign him. However, the reprieve comes with a heavy price: if Lem fails this mission into the White Forest, Anton will decommission him permanently. 

Lem notices his escort is unusually small, only to learn that the bulk of the Core's forces have been deployed alongside Rahu. Rahu has been fully restored and is currently being hailed as a hero, "liberating" northern villages and clear-cutting the path for new megacities. The oversight of these major operations has been handed to Rahu, while Lem is sidelined with a vague diplomatic directive: seeking out the reclusive inhabitants of the electronic forest and offering them an alliance with the Core. 

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I awoke in a specialized "Deep-Cold" frame, my memories of the remote detonation in the northern village still burning in my processor. I expected to see the white walls of a storage bay, but instead, I saw Cassia.

She wasn't smiling. Not this time.

"You're lucky to be online, Lem," she said, her voice tight. "Anton wanted you in permanent stasis after the Northern Mines. He called you unreliable. A liability."

I processed this. My hesitation had cost the Core a quick victory. "Why am I here?"

"Because I wouldn't let him," she said. "I told him it wasn't fair to make you hunt your own kind. The Gorgons were your people once, in a way. I made him see that." She looked away. "But it's a thin reprieve. He's given you one last chance. This is Mission 3—the Northern Shield. If you fail here, there won't be a next time."

As I stepped toward the staging area, I noticed the lack of support. Only a handful of Metal Vessels stood ready. In the previous missions, there were dozens.

"Where is the rest of the unit?" I asked.

Cassia hesitated. "They've been redeployed. With Rahu."

The name felt like a cold spike. "Is he...?"

"He's back, Lem. And he's doing exactly what Anton needs. He's 'liberating' the northern sites, clearing the way for the new construction. They're calling him a hero again. Anton is keeping him on a tight leash—away from you—but the Northern Shield campaign is moving forward under his command. You have this one task left."

"What is the objective?" I asked.

"It's... vague," she admitted. "The White Forest is a signal-dead zone. We know people live there, but we don't know who. You're to find them and deliver a message. An offer of ambassadorship. A hand of friendship from the Core."

It sounded simple, but in the Core, nothing was ever simple.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The transition was a silent, icy snap of the soul. I awoke in a frame of obsidian and shadow, designed to slip like a ghost through the analog storms of the North. I expected the void, but instead, I found Cassia. 

Her face was a mask of weary resolve. "I nearly lost you this time, Lem," she said. Her voice lacked its usual brightness, sounding more like the cold wind of the wastes. "Anton wanted to bury you. He said you were a broken machine, a liability. He wanted to place you in permanent stasis."

I felt the echo of my hesitation in the Northern Mines—a hesitation I couldn't explain to them. "Why am I still here?"

"Because I bargained for your life," she replied. "I told him it was cruel to make you executioner of your own past. I argued that the Gorgons—your kin—were a line you should never have been asked to cross." She paused, her eyes searching mine for a flicker of the man she thought she knew. "He agreed, but with an ultimatum: this is Mission 3, the Northern Shield. If you fail to deliver the message to the White Forest, you will be deactivated. Permanently."

I looked out at the assembly deck. The legions I had once stood with were gone. Only a few silent, silver forms remained to guard my path. "The soldiers have departed," I noted.

"They have followed a different light," Cassia said, her eyes darkening. "Rahu has returned to the field. He walks the northern snows as a savior, purging the wild machine threats and promising the people the glory of the new cities. He has become the hero Anton always wanted, leaving you in his shadow. They are keeping him far from you, Lem. They fear what happens when two suns touch."

"Then what is left for me?"

"An offer of peace," she said, though her words felt hollow. "An invitation for the inhabitants of the White Forest to become ambassadors to the Core. A bridge between worlds."

But as I prepared to step into the white silence of the forest, I knew the bridge was already burning.
