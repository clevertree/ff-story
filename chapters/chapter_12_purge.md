# Chapter 12: Purge

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Meeting in the Ruins:** Rahu meets Lem in the ruins of the Fire City while infiltrating the barrier.
2. **The Sanitizing Protocol:** The Core begins the 'Sanitizing Protocol' as Rahu installs the transponder to erase the city's self-governance.
3. **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Lem discovers the reality of the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' through Rahu's data probe before the purge.
4. **The Breach:** Gorgon Lem notices Rahu penetrating the Fire City fire barrier. 
5. **The City Hijack:** Rahu installs a remote transponder that allows the Core to remote control the Fire City. The ancient city's systems begin to fail and shut down under the Core's influence.
6. **The Unblinking Eye:** Rahu finishes his mission and looks around. He notices the Gorgon Lem among the debris only because Gorgons never stare—they are usually scanning or dormant.
7. **The Transformation:** Rahu attempts to neutralize the Gorgon shell. He destroys the shell, but is shocked when the fragments quickly reconfigure into a humanoid Lem.
8. **The Capture:** Rahu drags a weakened Lem back through the fire barrier to his crew. He initiates a physical probe of Lem's neural records.
9. **The Identification:** Rahu finds the Moon Cataclysm record and realizes Lem was in league with "Mara"—The Witch from the reset event. 
10. **The Clock Discrepancy:** Rahu notes a massive date mismatch. His internal clock says Year 1015, but Lem's record indicates the Cataclysm was only 15 years ago. 
11. **Sanitization Blast:** Rahu's logic processors fail as they struggle with the contradiction. The Core detects the "contamination" of his data and triggers a remote sanitation blast.
12. **Asset Recovery:** Lem is captured by Rahu's remaining crew and brought to a Core outpost and placed in stasis.

**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Rahu infiltrates the Fire City to install a Core transponder, seizing control and forcing the city into a shutdown. During the mission, he discovers Lem hidden in a Gorgon shell. After a violent confrontation and capture, Rahu probes Lem's memories, only to encounter the "Thousand-Year Fallacy"—the realization that their history has been fabricated. The Core immediately purges Rahu to contain the information, leaving Lem a captive asset in stasis.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I could feel the Fire City dying. It wasn't a sudden scream, but a slow, cold settling. Rahu had planted something at the center of the plaza, a Core transponder that hummed with a hollow, hungry light. As he worked, the city’s ancient warmth began to bleed away. Shadows stretched longer than they ever had before, and for the first time in a thousand years, the streets went dark.

I watched him from the heavy, rusted eyes of my Gorgon shell. I didn't move. I didn't even breathe. But he caught me anyway. Maybe it was because I was the only thing in the city that was still looking back at him. 

"Anomaly detected," he whispered, and then the world exploded into silver. He tried to break me, but my body refused to stay broken. The fragments of the Gorgon flowed back together, trapping me in a form that looked all too human. 

When he finally pinned me down and forced a connection to my mind, I saw the exact moment he broke. He was looking for the history of a world that ended ten centuries ago. Instead, he found me—and the memory of a Moon that fell only yesterday. 

"This... this isn't possible," he stammered, his eyes wide with a terrifying realization. "The dates are wrong. Everything is wrong."

The Core didn't give him time to understand. A white light erupted from his chest, a cruel 'cleanup' command that erased the soldier and the secret all at once. The blast was a wall of heat that knocked the world out of focus.

As the darkness took me, I felt the heavy weight of the Core's grip finally closing around my neck. I wasn't just a memory anymore. I was an 'Asset' being returned to its shelf. 

*Stasis engaged,* the voice in the dark said. And then there was nothing.

From the heavy, ancient stillness of my Gorgon shell, I watched the steel shadow descend. Rahu did not come with the reverence of a guest; he came as a conqueror, tearing through our sanctuary’s fire-barrier like a blade through a tapestry. He was a creature of the Core, bound by protocols and blinded by duty. I felt the heartbeat of my city falter as he drove a cold, blue transponder into the plaza’s heart. One by one, the eternal fires of our home flickered and died, replaced by a hollow, artificial light that made the air feel like ice.

His work was done. He looked out over the square, past a thousand dormant brothers of stone and flame. But I was different. I was not merely scanning; I was watching. My gaze was a weight he could not ignore, a final, defiant spark in a city of dying embers.

He struck without a word. A bolt of white energy shattered my outer shell—a blow intended to reduce me to scrap. He expected the end; instead, he witnessed a transformation. He watched in terror as the silver fragments of my being sang back together, knitting into the humanoid form of a hero from his own forgotten legends. I rose from the ruins of my metal skin, a witness to his betrayal.

The 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' was the fire that consumed him. When he dragged me into the dying light and forced a connection to my spirit, he did not find an 'ancient monster.' He found an echo of the Moon Cataclysm—the memory of a world that had ended only fifteen summers ago, not ten centuries.

I watched his spirit fracture as the raw, unedited truth collided with the glass architecture of his manufactured history. His world was not a legacy; it was a lie. The Core’s response was not an explanation; it was a sentence of death. Through his own link, I felt the 'Sanitation Protocol' ignite. His chest began to glow with a blinding, merciless intensity as his internal fires were turned against him, forcibly transforming the soldier into a shroud of flame.

The blast was a scream of light that tore through the city and the sky alike. A wall of white heat consumed the plaza, shredding both the smog of the wastes and the truth of his revelation in a single, devastating pulse. As the shockwave threw me back into the long dark, I felt the heavy hand of the Core close around my spirit. I was no longer the architect of a dream; I was a prize for the masters of the night.

I was falling into a winter that had no end, carried away to a place where my memories would be locked behind gates of steel. I was an 'Asset' once more, waitng in the frozen silence for a light that might never return.
