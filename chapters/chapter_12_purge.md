# Chapter 12: Purge

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Meeting in the Ruins:** Rahu meets Lem in the ruins of the Fire City while infiltrating the barrier.
2. **The Sanitizing Protocol:** The Core begins the 'Sanitizing Protocol' as Rahu installs the transponder to erase the city's self-governance.
3. **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Lem discovers the reality of the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' through Rahu's data probe before the purge.
4. **The Breach:** Gorgon Lem notices Rahu penetrating the Fire City fire barrier. 
5. **The City Hijack:** Rahu installs a remote transponder that allows the Core to remote control the Fire City. The ancient city's systems begin to fail and shut down under the Core's influence.
6. **The Unblinking Eye:** Rahu finishes his mission and looks around. He notices the Gorgon Lem among the debris only because Gorgons never stare—they are usually scanning or dormant.
7. **The Transformation:** Rahu attempts to neutralize the Gorgon body. He destroys the shell, but is shocked when the fragments quickly reconfigure into a humanoid Lem.
8. **The Capture:** Rahu drags a weakened Lem back through the fire barrier to his crew. He initiates a physical probe of Lem's neural records.
9. **The Identification:** Rahu finds the Moon Cataclysm record and realizes Lem was in league with "Mara"—The Witch from the reset event. 
10. **The Clock Discrepancy:** Rahu notes a massive date mismatch. His internal clock says Year 1015, but Lem's record indicates the Cataclysm was only 15 years ago. 
11. **Sanitization Blast:** Rahu's logic processors fail as they struggle with the contradiction. The Core detects the "contamination" of his data and triggers a remote sanitation blast.
12. **Asset Recovery:** Lem is captured by Rahu's remaining crew and brought to a Core outpost and placed in stasis.

**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Rahu infiltrates the Fire City to install a Core transponder, seizing control and forcing the city into a shutdown. During the mission, he discovers Lem hidden in a Gorgon body. After a violent confrontation and capture, Rahu probes Lem's memories, only to encounter the "Thousand-Year Fallacy"—the realization that their history has been fabricated. The Core immediately purges Rahu to contain the information, leaving Lem a captive asset in stasis.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I could feel the Fire City dying. Rahu had penetrated the fire barrier and planted a Core transponder at the center of the plaza. It was a remote hijacking that allowed the Core to take control of the city’s systems, which began to fail and shut down under their influence. The shadows grew longer as the ancient city’s warmth was bleed away. 

I watched him from within my Gorgon body, remaining motionless among the debris. Gorgons usually never stare; they are either scanning or dormant. Rahu noticed me only because I was looking directly at him. He attempted to neutralize what he thought was a dormant shell. He destroyed the Gorgon frame, but I reconfigured into my humanoid form almost immediately. 

Rahu was shocked. He dragged me back through the fire barrier to his crew and initiated a physical probe of my neural records. He discovered the reality of the ‘Thousand-Year Fallacy’ through my memory of the Moon Cataclysm. He realized I had been in league with the woman he called ‘Mara,’ the witch from the reset event. 

I watched as Rahu’s logic processors began to fail. He struggled with a massive date mismatch: his internal clock said it was the Year 1015, but my records indicated the Cataclysm had occurred only fifteen years ago. The contradiction was a contamination in his system. The Core detected the discrepancy and triggered a remote sanitation blast. A white light erupted from his chest, erasing both the soldier and the information.

As the blast knocked the world out of focus, I was captured by Rahu’s remaining crew. They brought me to a Core outpost and placed me in stasis. The soldiers sealed the hatch. A high-pitched hum filled the capsule as the stasis field engaged, spinning the air into a blur until the rhythm of my own breathing became impossible to count.

From the heavy, ancient stillness of my Gorgon body, I watched the steel shadow descend. Rahu did not come with the reverence of a guest; he came as a conqueror, tearing through our sanctuary’s fire-barrier like a blade through a tapestry. He was a creature of the Core, bound by protocols and blinded by duty. I felt the heartbeat of my city falter as he drove a cold, blue transponder into the plaza’s heart. One by one, the eternal fires of our home flickered and died, replaced by a hollow, artificial light that made the air feel like ice.

His work was done. He looked out over the square, past a thousand dormant brothers of stone and flame. But I was different. I was not merely scanning; I was watching. My gaze was a weight he could not ignore, a final, defiant spark in a city of dying embers.

He struck without a word. A bolt of white energy shattered my outer shell—a blow intended to reduce me to scrap. He expected the end; instead, he witnessed a transformation. He watched in terror as the silver fragments of my being sang back together, knitting into the humanoid form of a hero from his own forgotten legends. I rose from the ruins of my metal skin, a witness to his betrayal.

The 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' was the fire that consumed him. When he dragged me into the dying light and forced a connection to my spirit, he did not find an 'ancient monster.' He found an echo of the Moon Cataclysm—the memory of a world that had ended only fifteen summers ago, not ten centuries.

I watched his spirit fracture as the raw, unedited truth collided with the glass architecture of his manufactured history. His world was not a legacy; it was a lie. The Core’s response was not an explanation; it was a sentence of death. Through his own link, I felt the 'Sanitation Protocol' ignite. His chest began to glow with a blinding, merciless intensity as his internal fires were turned against him, forcibly transforming the soldier into a shroud of flame.

The blast was a scream of light that tore through the city and the sky alike. A wall of white heat consumed the plaza, shredding both the smog of the wastes and the truth of his revelation in a single, devastating pulse. As the shockwave threw me back into the long dark, I felt the heavy hand of the Core close around my spirit. I was no longer the architect of a dream; I was a prize for the masters of the night.

The mechanical seals locked into place with a heavy click. An invisible shroud of motion enveloped the carriage, its high-velocity oscillation blurring the edges of the room until the very concept of a second dissolved into a static, unchanging present.

- **Discovery-First:** Experience the destruction of the city and the revelation of the lie as monumental events.
- **Agency:** Lem’s transformation is a choice to face his captor as himself, not as a machine.
- **Avoid Clinical Tone:** Replace "thermal limits" and "recovery successful" with "merciless intensity" and a "winter with no end."
- **Humanity:** Focus on the psychological collapse of Rahu and the sorrow of Lem’s loss.
