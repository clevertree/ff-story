# Chapter 07: Sacrifice

**Setting:** Lunar surface (combat zone); Hermes command bridge; Lunar pyramid interior
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Bottleneck:** The human fleet is pinned behind a ridge. The comms are filled with overlapping reports of increased plasma fire. The Hermes and other ships attempt to fire on Rahu's position but the debris field prevents clear shots with plasma weapons or projectiles. 
2. **The Tactical Zone:** The plain leading to the lunar base is an open surface with no geometric cover. From the mountain peak, Rahu launches a continuous stream of blue plasma spheres. The spheres arc down and strike any vehicle that moves onto the plain. 
3. **CheckMate:** Suddenly a bright bloom of plasma shoots out from Rahu's position as he executes a massive strike against the ground forces. Exposed in their positions they know they cannot run away in time to avoid the plasma as the steep canyons offer no protection from above.  
4. **The Transit of *Hermes*:** The flagship *Hermes* moves from its orbital position and enters the lower atmosphere crashing through the debris field and taking a lot of damage. It descends directly into the path of the plasma spheres which are magnetically attracted to the ship's hull.
5. **Rahu Destroyed:** Hermes has decended low enough that it can now fire on Rahu and all cannons fire in unison. Lem com shows a networked shot of Rahu close up being engulfed in light as he disintegrates along with the nearby weapon station he was using.
6. **The Collision:** Thousands of plasma spheres divert from the plain and converge on the *Hermes*. The ship’s hull glows blue before a large thermal discharge occurs. The peak of the mountain and the ship are obscured by light. When the smoke clears, neither Rahu nor the *Hermes* are visible.
7. **Command Shift:** Iris Novak’s voice comes over the general channel. She suggests Tor's sacrifice was necessary to defend the mission and the Earth. She states that the corridor is clear and orders all units to advance toward the central pyramid.
8. **The Advance:** Lem drives his hovercraft across the plain. He passes the wreckage of the bikes and the remains of several Striders. The ground vibrates as if the rock itself is fracturing.
9. **Entry:** The strike force reaches the pyramid. The massive doors are open. The entire structure is humming with a faint fluorescence. 
10. **Securing the Perimeter:** Ground teams deploy heavy metal seals across the entry jambs. They lock the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside is muffled by the seal. They couldn't leave part of the crew outside the seal because the environment outside the pyramid was too unstable.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
As Rahu launches relentless plasma spheres from a mountain peak, pinning the human fleet behind a ridge, the flagship *Hermes* moves into the lower atmosphere to shield the units. In a massive thermal collision, thousands of spheres converge on the *Hermes*, vaporizing both the flagship and Rahu’s position in an incandescent bloom. Taking command, Iris Novak orders the units to advance through the cleared corridor. Lem drives across the vibrating lunar plain, passing wreckage to reach the central pyramid’s open doors. Once inside, the ground teams deploy heavy metal seals to lock the perimeter, shifting from the chaos of battle into an eerie, muffled silence as they wait in the central hall.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The human fleet was pinned behind a ridge by intense plasma fire. Rahu stood on a mountain peak, launching a continuous stream of blue plasma spheres that struck any vehicle moving onto the open plain. The comms were filled with overlapping reports. The *Hermes* and other ships attempted to fire on Rahu’s position, but the debris field prevented clear shots.

Suddenly, a bright bloom of plasma erupted from Rahu's position as he executed a massive strike against the ground forces. This was "CheckMate." Exposed in their positions, the soldiers knew they could not run away in time to avoid the plasma, as the steep canyons offered no protection from above.

The flagship *Hermes* moved from its orbital position and entered the lower atmosphere, crashing through the debris field and taking heavy damage. It descended directly into the path of the plasma spheres, which were magnetically attracted to the ship's hull. This move cleared a corridor for us. As the *Hermes* descended low enough, it fired all of its cannons in unison. My display showed a networked shot of Rahu being engulfed in light and disintegrating along with his weapon station.

Thousands of plasma spheres then diverted from the plain and converged on the *Hermes*. The ship’s hull glowed blue before a large thermal discharge occurred. The peak of the mountain and the ship were obscured by light. When the smoke cleared, neither Rahu nor the *Hermes* were visible.

Iris Novak’s voice came over the general channel, steady and assertive. She suggested that Tor's sacrifice was necessary to defend the mission and the Earth. She stated that the corridor was clear and ordered all units to advance toward the central pyramid.

I drove my hovercraft across the plain, passing the wreckage of the bikes and the remains of several Striders. The ground vibrated as if the rock itself was fracturing. We reached the pyramid, where the massive doors were open. The entire structure was humming with a faint fluorescence. Once inside, the ground teams deployed heavy metal seals across the entry jambs and locked the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside was muffled by the seal. We were inside, and the environment outside had become too unstable to leave anyone behind.

The plain before the central pyramid was a killing floor of open dust. On a spire of jagged rock above the target, a silhouette of molten light—the one the news had named 'Prometheus'—orchestrated the defense. He didn't just fire; he commanded the heavens themselves. Blue spheres of plasma arched downward in a continuous, graceful rain, each one seeking out the metal heart of a hovercraft. We were pinned, our vehicles groaning as the static charge from the Moon's ancient defenses filled the air with a hum that set my teeth on edge. This was the trial—the sky itself rejecting our presence.

The second trial was the terror that threatened to consume the men. Over the comms, I heard the breaking of spirits—voices that had been disciplined for years fighting back waves of raw, jagged panic as they looked upon the impossible reality of the Moon. Suddenly, a blinding bloom of plasma erupted from the peak—a move the tactical computers labeled "CheckMate." The sky became a ceiling of fire, trapping the fleet in the canyons with no path of retreat.

Then the sky darkened, but it wasn't a cloud. The *Hermes* moved into the lower atmosphere, a massive, silver shield of steel. It was a heroic, sacrificial weight. Thousands of plasma spheres diverted from the ground units, swarming toward the flagship like moths to a flame. But the *Hermes* wasn't finished. As it descended, every cannon on the ship fired in a single, coordinated burst. On my HUD, a networked feed showed the mountain peak—and the figure upon it—being engulfed in a brilliant white light. Rahu disintegrated along with the spire.

The final collision was a silent, incandescent bloom that swallowed the heart of the ship in a single, magnificent discharge of light. When the smoke finally cleared, the path was open.

"Advance," Iris Novak’s voice cut through the static, steady and absolute. "For the world we left behind. Do not stop."

We drove across the vibrating lunar plain, the ground singing beneath our treads. We reached the pyramid—a windowless monolith of geometric precision that felt older than time. Once inside, the roar of the battle evaporated, replaced by a silence so deep it felt like a physical weight. The air was still, waiting. Novak's team deployed heavy metal seals across the entry jambs, locking us into the heart of the mystery.

In the center of the hall, the ground teams extracted the cases with a reverence usually reserved for relics. As Novak slotted the final, flickering shard into the pyramid's conduit, I felt a new sensation. It wasn't a sound, but a deep, rhythmic heartbeat that moved through the rock and into my own frame. The Moon was awakening. We weren't just soldiers; we were the heralds of a new age, waiting in the dark for the dawn.
