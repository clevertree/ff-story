## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Analog Manifestation:** Lem stands in the clearing, but he is different. For the first time, he has reconstituted himself without Core intervention. He has manifested from the deep, organic-machine material of the "Analog Trees." This is **Analog Lem**—a version of himself built from the base Synodic technology that predates the Core's digital corruption.
2.  **Self-Inspection:** Lem realizes he is "back," but he lacks the usual digital HUD and Archivist mission overlays. He feels a profound connection to the White Forest, recognizing its trees as the foundation for both the "wild" Synodics and the independent technology of the forest dwellers who banned all things digital.
3.  **The Approaching Inferno:** Before he can plan his next move, a massive explosion rocks the clearing. The fire he saw in his vision is closer now. Trees collapse in his line of sight, some bursting into flame without warning.
4.  **The Clumsy Plasma:** The invisible heat ray is at work. It doesn't move in a straight line; it is a "clumsy" plasma effect that arcs and jumps toward the nearest conductive object. It is terrifyingly unpredictable—everything it touches erupts into fire for no apparent reason.
5.  **Carving the Forest:** Through the smoke and falling timber, Lem determines the attack is coming from one consistent direction outside the forest, slowly and methodically carving a path inward. 
6.  **The Random Descent:** As explosions draw nearer, Lem briefly considers moving toward the source but quickly realizes the fire is already upon him. The arcs of plasma are cutting sporadically deep into the forest. He begins to run, navigating a landscape of random, sudden conflagrations.
7.  **The Empty Forest:** As he runs, Lem notices the absence of life. There are no animals, no electronic snakes, and no sign of the mysterious inhabitants. The silence of the abandoned forest, punctuated only by the roar of fire and the crash of falling trees, suggests a total evacuation.
8.  **The Crashed Carrier:** Deep in the forest, near the edge of the burning zone, Lem discovers a floating carrier platform. It has malfunctioned and crashed into an Analog Tree, half-buried in the ground and abandoned. It is a piece of the inhabitants' unique non-digital technology.
9.  **Inspection:** Lem approaches the downed craft to inspect it, hoping it might offer clues or a means of escape. 
10. **The Ambush:** Just as he reaches the carrier, the forest inhabitants pop out of nowhere, surrounding him and raising their weapons. This time, Myrr is not with them. The guards remain masked, their silent hostility immediate and absolute.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **Identity Shift:** He experiences the physical reality of being an "Analog" entity, realizing he is no longer a tool of the Technocracy.
-   **Survival Instinct:** Faced with a weapon he cannot see and a fire that jumps randomly, he is forced into a desperate, unguided flight for survival.
-   **King of Nothing:** He finds himself physically back in his "kingdom" (The White Forest), only to find it being methodically erased.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Analog Technology:** Introduction to the "Carrier Platforms" and the organic-machine nature of the White Forest's dwellers.
-   **Plasma Arcing:** Further detail on the thermal weaponry of the Gorgon heavy-striders and its erratic, arcing behavior in heavy atmosphere.
-   **Analog Lem:** The physical properties of a Vessel reconstituted from non-digital Synodic substrate.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   Describe the "clumsy" plasma as something alive and hungry, arcing like lightning but carrying the weight of liquid fire.
-   The transition from the "dream clearing" to the "burning reality" should feel visceral—smell of ozone and burning superconducting polymer.
-   The inhabitants' return should feel like a betrayal; Lem has come to help, but he still looks like the entity that struck down Myrr.
