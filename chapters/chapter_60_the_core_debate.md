# Chapter 60: The Core Debate

## Outline / Summary
- **Behind the Scenes:** The narrative shifts to the desert base (Cradle Zero). The Core leadership (Anton Drexler, Dr. Vane, and Novak) is locked in a long-term debate.
- **The "Maya" Problem:** They have identified Arlo as the reincarnation of the Maya (Water Vessel) spirit. They speculate that the villages' resistance is a direct result of her spiritual influence.
- **The Options:**
    - **Capture & Consumption:** Use beacons to kill Arlo and "eat" the signal.
    - **Containment:** Bring Arlo to the base and extract the spirit slowly.
    - **Cryo-Sleep:** Put Arlo in stasis forever to prevent any further reincarnation.
- **The Stalemate Cause:** No consensus is reached. Fear of "unleashing the unknown" or triggering a massive revolution prevents first action.

## Character Development
- **Anton Drexler:** Advocates for the most ruthless "Plan B" options, viewing Arlo as a bug in the system.
- **Dr. Elowen Vane:** Increasingly conflicted. She sees the villagers' utopia as a valid alternative to the Hive Cities.
- **Novak:** Focuses on the technical stability of the Core's expansion, wary of cultural schisms.
