# Chapter 09: The Restoration

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The reset intensifies.** Novak notes the Sun appears to be going out. It's losing strength rapidly. 
2. **The Earth experiences major cataclysm** on the side nearest the moon.
3. **Novak notices the charge of the moon has changed.** 
4. **Weapon Failure:** Soldiers report the status field on Rahu is going out. They try to repair it but their guns are no longer firing plasma straight. It arcs towards the ground and back at them, and they abandon their weapons.
5. **Rahu's stasis field evaporates and he wakes up.** 
6. **Disintegration:** Everyone watches as he lurches towards the vortex with great trouble, eventually catching on fire and disintegrating just like Lynn did. 
7. **Abortion:** Shortly after Rahu disintegrates, the reset is aborted and rapidly shuts down.
8. **The moon and earth calm**, and Rahu is seen restoring in the center of the pyramid. 
9. **As he falls to the floor in a weakened state**, Iris once again orders the soldiers to fire and they paralyze him in a stasis field. 
10. **Iris then orders the soldiers to paralyze Lem**, and he is struck by the same weapons. 
11. **Darkness:** Lem's vision goes dark.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The reset fails as Rahu disintegrates into the vortex; Novak secures the survivors in stasis.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The reset intensified until the light coming from the pyramid’s center was the only thing I could see clearly. Outside, the sky was changing. Iris Novak looked at her sensors and then up through the translucent sections of the pyramid’s roof. She noted that the Sun appeared to be going out; its strength was dropping rapidly as if the energy was being pulled somewhere else.

On the side of the Earth nearest the moon, major cataclysms were already being recorded. The tectonic plates shifted with enough force to register on the pyramid’s floor, and the atmosphere glowed with the friction of the Lunar resonance. Novak turned her display toward the soldiers. She said the magnetic charge of the moon had changed.

Rahu lay in the center of the hall, held by the stasis field Novak had established. The soldiers around him began to shout as their equipment malfunctioned. They reported that the field was failing. When they tried to use their experimental launchers to stabilize the containment, the beams didn't fire straight; the plasma arced toward the ground and back at the soldiers, forcing them to abandon the heavy weapons.

The stasis field evaporated with a sound like tearing metal. Rahu woke up.

He didn't attack. He ignored us, his frame smoking and his limbs moving with great difficulty. We all watched as he lurched toward the swirling vortex in the center of the pyramid where Lynn had vanished. He fought against the pressure of the reset, his metal body catching on fire from the intensity of the light. Then, just like Lynn, he disintegrated into the vortex.

A few seconds after Rahu was gone, the reset was aborted. The screaming noise of the column died away, and the light collapsed into a single point before vanishing entirely. The vibration in the floor stopped. The moon and the Earth grew calm.

In the sudden silence, Rahu began to reappear. He was restoring in the center of the pyramid, his form slowly knitting back together from fragments of light. When the process finished, he fell to the stone floor in a weakened state, his frame charred and motionless.

Iris Novak didn't wait for him to recover. She ordered the soldiers to fire again. This time, the weapons functioned normally. They struck Rahu with a new stasis field, paralyzing him where he lay.

Then she turned and looked directly at me. She gave the order to the soldiers to paralyze me as well. I heard the hum of the launchers charging up, and then the same beams of plasma and electricity hit my frame. I felt the surge of the field locking my joints.

My vision went dark.

## Revision Notes
- Focus on the sensory experience of the reset's failure and the catastrophic scale of the event.
- Maintain Novak's clinical detachment even as the sun appears to fail.
- Describe Rahu's struggle and disintegration as a physical process.
- The paralysis of Lem should be presented as a pragmatic, cold decision by Novak.

<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The light of the Restoration was a physical weight, a blinding whiteness that bleached the world of detail. Novak’s sensors screamed a warning—the Sun was dying, its fire being siphoned away into the foundation of the Moon like a candle in a gale. Through the translucent ceiling, I saw the Earth shudder—the side facing us glowing with the friction of shifting continents, a slow-motion car crash on a planetary scale.

Rahu lay broken in the center of the hall, held by the dying embers of Novak’s stasis field. The soldiers’ weapons began to fail, their plasma bolts arcing wildly toward the ground as the very magnetic poles of the moon inverted. The field evaporated with a sound like tearing silk.

Rahu rose. He didn't attack us; he didn't even see us. He was a smoking wreck of a god, lurching toward the vortex where Lynn had vanished. He caught fire—not the fire of his power, but the fire of friction—and disintegrated into the light.

Then, the reset choked. The screaming column of energy collapsed with a violent shudder, and the world fell into a silence so profound it felt like deafness. In the center of the hall, fragments of light began to knit together, weaving a new, charred body from the Restoration. Rahu was back, his physical form restored but broken, falling to the stone in a heap of blackened silver.

Novak didn't hesitate. She ordered the final strike. The same beams of paralyzing light that felled Rahu were turned on me. I felt the static charge lock my joints, my inner strength failing against the cold precision of her craft. I was structure without movement, a monument to a failed world. My vision bled into a final, heavy dark.
