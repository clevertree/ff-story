## Chapter Outline

1.  **The New Transmission:** The Crew, monitoring city broadcasts, notices a massive anomaly. The cities are "under attack," but not by the White Forest. 
2.  **The Great Migration:** Surveillance shows every Synodic life form in the desert region—Striders, Monoliths, and smaller scavengers—is moving toward the Hive Cities.
3.  **The Call:** The machines emit a deafening, hooting noise. It is a primitive, non-digital signal that resonates through the dunes.
4.  **The Gorgon Rebellion:** Inside the cities, the enslaved Gorgons drop their tools. They "snap out" of their indoctrination, responding to the hooting Call. They seize whatever transport they can (usually Striders) and exit the cities to join the wild machines.
5.  **The Evacuation Dilemma:** The Crew realizes a mass civilian exodus is inevitable as the conflict centers on the cities. They begin redrawing their plans for a mass evacuation effort. 
6.  **Tor's Update:** General Tor appears on the news, attempting to project calm. He mentions "buoys," "countermeasures," and "evacuation routes," but remains vague.
7.  **The Reconfigured War:** When asked about the evacuation vehicles, Tor reveals they have all been reconfigured into defensive war machines. The civilians are left with a "paradise" that has no exits.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Observer of the Collective:** Recognizing the "hooting" as a manifestation of the Synodic hive-will, independent of Core programming.

### General Tor
-   **The Stoic Face of Failure:** Plying the public with "measure of calm" while his tactical resources are being devoured by the necessity of the defense.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Synodic Communication:** The "Hooting Call" as an analog fallback for the mechanical ecosystem.
-   **Hive City Panic:** The transition from utopian comfort to total disorientation as the "Architects" fail.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Hooting" should be described as a sound that bypasses the ears and hits the Aether-Drive directly.
-   The civilian confusion should feel grounded and tragic—people who don't know how to navigate the desert because they've never left their gardens.
-   The chapter ends with the Synodic army forming a massive, silent circle around the cities, waiting for the beacons to fail.
