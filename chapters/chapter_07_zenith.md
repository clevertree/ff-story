**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge, near-lunar space

**POV:** Lem (obarchive); Lynn (decision-maker); Soldiers (reaction)
**Estimated Length:** 3,000-3,500 words

---

## Chapter Outline

1. **Zenith Approach:** Ship reaches altitude aligned with Moon; begins controlled descent to far side
2. **The Vista:** Moon now looms close, vast, undeniably real—perception shift from "abstract threat" to "present danger"
3. **Soldier Panic:** One soldier breaks mentally; shouts, disrupts bridge discipline
4. **Peer Response:** Nearby soldiers attempt to calm/restrain him using duty and training
5. **Failure to Contain:** The soldier's panic cannot be suppressed through normal means
6. **Lynn's Arrival:** She emerges from planning room; immediate authority shift in atmosphere
7. **Investigation:** Lynn questions officers about the soldier's stability; learns he passed all briefings
8. **The Problem Named:** Officers explain—the issue isn't information, but the moment abstract truth becomes undeniable reality
9. **Lynn's Decision:** She orders the soldier removed from the ship without hesitation
10. **The Jettison:** Escape pod launched; soldier sent back to Earth alone
11. **Discipline Restored:** Remaining crew falls back into formation; panic suppressed; focus restored

## Character Arc

**Lynn's Authority Crystallized:**
- She moves from background operative to visible commander
- Officers defer to her over formal military hierarchy
- Her decision to jettison the soldier demonstrates ruthlessness and certainty
- She understands the psychological/emotional dimensions of the crisis better than military command

**Novak's Role Established:**
- She is present as both witness and executor of Lynn's orders
- Her calm efficiency suggests she may have foreknowledge or ideological alignment with Core objectives
- She bridges Lynn's authority with operational military command
- Her documentation of the incident (for Core records?) suggests deeper loyalty to Core than to military

**Lem's Observation Deepens:**
- He witnesses Lynn's true power and willingness to sacrifice individuals.
- As a teenage boy, he watches the "adults"—the professional soldiers and officers—succumb to a fear he doesn't feel.
- He is present during the first major moral compromise of the mission.
- His role as witness to institutional cruelty becomes clear.

**Soldiers' Collective Obedience:**
- Panic → failed containment → authority intervention → restored discipline
- The jettison acts as psychological reset; fear is replaced by grim acceptance
- They understand the stakes have increased; doubt is now forbidden

**The Panicking Soldier (Brief Arc):**
- Competent, trained, stable until the moment of truth
- Reality overrides all training and preparation
- He becomes an object lesson—dissent is not tolerated

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Facts Applied:**
- Lynn has authority to make life-or-death decisions (suggests Core hierarchy above military)
- The gap between abstract knowledge and sensory reality is a psychological weapon
- Soldiers are willing to accept casualties if the mission is framed as necessary
- The Moon's proximity and reality are psychologically overwhelming
- Military hierarchy is subordinate to Core operatives (Lynn's authority)

✅ **Character Mechanics:**
- General Tor is aware and communicative (appears after this chapter)
- Remote leadership is possible; Tor coordinates via intercom
- The crew is large enough that individual soldiers can be removed without mission failure
- Psychologically, fear suppression requires strong authority figures

## Key Scenes/Beats

| Beat | Location | Character Focus | Action | Emotional Shift |
|------|----------|---|---|---|
| Zenith arrival | Bridge viewports | Soldiers/Lem | Ship reaches alignment altitude | Awe → dread |
| Reality shock | Viewports | Panicked soldier | Moon dominates view; abstract becomes real | Denial → panic |
| Outburst | Bridge center | Soldiers gathered | Man shouts, disrupts discipline | Order → chaos |
| Containment attempt | Crew quarters area | Nearby soldiers | They try to calm/reason with him | Hope → futility |
| Failure | Bridge | Officers; Novak observing | They cannot restore him to function | Control lost |
| Lynn's entrance | Bridge threshold | All present | She emerges from planning room | Uncertainty → authority |
| Questioning | Command center | Lynn + Officers; Novak present | Investigation of soldier's psych eval | Searching → clarity |
| The explanation | Bridge | Officers (Lynn listening); Novak recording | "Problem is not information, but reality" | Defensive → accepted |
| Order issued | Bridge | Lynn; Novak executes | "Remove him from the ship" | Shock → compliance |
| Escort | Corridors to pod bay | Soldier (now silent); Novak ensures execution | Guards escort him mechanically | Desperation → resignation |
| Jettison | Bridge viewports | All watch; Novak documents | Pod separates; soldier alone in vacuum returning to Earth | Horror → grim satisfaction |
| Reformation | Bridge | Remaining crew; Novak restores order | Soldiers return to stations; discipline restored | Scattered → focused |

## Critical Questions / Ambiguities

❓ **Why does Lynn jettison the soldier rather than confining him?**
- Is it mercy (letting him return alive rather than being trapped on a doomed ship)?
- Is it psychological terrorism (making an example for others)?
- Is it logistical (they cannot afford a panicked liability)?
- **Recommendation:** Ambiguous; different interpretations reveal different views of Lynn

❓ **Does the soldier survive the return journey?**
- Or is the pod meant to fail?
- **Impact:** Determines if Lynn is pragmatic or cruel

❓ **How much does Novak know about Lynn's decision beforehand?**
- Does she execute the jettison because she expects it, or is she also surprised?
- Does her calm efficiency suggest foreknowledge or simply military discipline?
- **Impact:** Novak's role as Lynn's operative vs. loyal military officer

❓ **How does Lem react internally to this act?**
- Does he recognize it as necessary? Horrifying? Strategic?
- **Recommendation:** He observes without judgment; perhaps notes the efficiency

❓ **Are there other panicked soldiers, or is this one case?**
- Does Lynn's action prevent further panic, or merely delay it?
- **Sets up:** Potential for more disruptions in Chapter 8

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)

- Establish "Zenith" as both a literal altitude and a metaphorical moment of commitment
- Show the psychological weight of proximity—the Moon is no longer abstract
- The soldier's panic should feel authentic and relatable; readers may empathize with him
- Lynn's arrival should shift the room's atmosphere instantly; her authority is palpable
- The jettison should be described matter-of-factly, not sensationally (Lynn's efficiency)
- The crew's reformation should feel like a psychological reset, not a restoration
- End on restored discipline but with undercurrent of dread—the real threat hasn't arrived yet
- Foreshadow: General Tor's imminent appearance via intercom
