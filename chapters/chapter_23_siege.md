# Chapter 23: Siege

**Setting:** Northern Hive Periphery; The Desert Plain; *Obsidian Sledge* (Flagship)
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The First Strike:** Lem and Myrr lead the planned "Tree Army"—bio-mechanical assault units reinforced with White Forest wood—in a massive offensive against Cradle Zero.
2. **The Node Theory:** Myrr's team identifies the city nodes as purely control nodes. Their high-fidelity analog sensors confirm there are no significant power-generation signatures, despite the massive decoy cables the Core has installed to deceive digital scanners. They conclude that taking them out will sever the command link without harming civilian infrastructure. 
3. **The Propaganda War:** As they breach the walls, the Core's media channels begin broadcasting a "Terrorist" narrative, portraying the resistance as mindless Gorgon monsters attacking vital civilian infrastructure.
4. **The False Flag Power-Cut:** As the first node is dismantled, the entire city’s power grid is suddenly disabled. The media immediately blames the "terrorists" for taking out the power stations.
5. **The Analog Revelation:** While the Hive citizens believe the lie, Myrr's team uses their analog sensors—which can process high-fidelity wave data beyond the Core's digital encryption—to detect the truth. They record the exact signal from the Core's central spire that manually tripped the power grid. They realize the nodes were never power plants; the Core disabled the grid on purpose to frame the resistance.
6. **The Public Accusation:** Despite the truth, the media footage of a "city planner" pleading for mercy convinces the public that the resistance knew they were taking out the power. Myrr's team realizes they have been branded as specialists in civilian suffering and that the people of the Hive will never see them as liberators, but only as "Terrorists."
7. **The Rising Resistance:** Myrr takes command of the chaos, arguing that if they are already labeled terrorists, they must achieve their objective by any means necessary. He orders a full assault directly on the Cradle Zero desert base. 
8. **The General’s Entrance:** General Tor’s flagship, the *Obsidian Sledge*, emerges from the thermal haze. Tor broadcasts a single message: "To all Terrorists - surrender or be destroyed."
9. **The Tree Army Engagement:** The Tree Army engages in a large scale battle with the Core defences. It appears to have the upperhand as the White Forest crew are able to order it to rebuild itself when it's destroyed. The Core technology takes much longer to build.
10. **Rahu's Ambush:** However, the flagship of the Tree Army crewed by a white forest soldier crashes to the ground unexpectedly. It's engines explode leaving the hull of the ship stranded. Other ships suddenly explode as well. The crew identifies Rahu who has deceptively entered the battle camouflaged with desert colors.  
11. **Rahu:** The Tree Army focuses on Rahu but to no avail. He is hard to see in the rising dust and his entire vehicle is camouflaged. He is too battle hardened for the white forest crew who themselves have never experienced a battle. 
12. **Retreat:** Rahu destroys another flagship with a human white forest soldier in the cockpit and the ship crashes, except this time it explodes completely in a bright fireball. This is too much for the white forest crew and they evacuate the remaining personel from the battle while leaving their tree army behind to continue fighting. 
13. **Defeat:** The battle turns in the Core's favor as the white forest crew are no longer in the battle to direct it. Rahu and the Core waste no time and burn the remaining tree army to ashes.

## Synopsis
Lem and Myrr lead the White Forest's "Tree Army" in an assault on Cradle Zero, only to find themselves ensnared in a sophisticated false flag operation. Myrr’s team correctly identifies the city nodes as control towers, but the Core manually disables the city's power grid during the attack to frame the resistance. While Core media broadcasts a narrative of "terrorists" attacking civilian infrastructure, Myrr’s team uses their superior analog sensors to detect the internal Core signal that actually cut the power. Despite having the truth, the psychological toll of being branded as mass murderers undermines the White Forest crew. The arrival of General Tor’s *Obsidian Sledge* and the intervention of a camouflaged Rahu turn the tide, forcing the inexperienced resistance to panic and retreat, abandoning their wooden army to be incinerated.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I stood on the command deck of the bio-mechanical flagship, watching the "Tree Army" tear through the Core's perimeter. These were giant wooden walkers, reinforced with White Forest tech that could regrow limbs in seconds. We were winning—or so it looked. We were targeting the "nodes" that Myrr’s team correctly identified as control towers. We weren't touching the power plants.

But then, the lights in the city below winked out all at once. The propaganda started immediately. Every screen in the city began broadcasting images of dark hospitals and stalled elevators, blaming us for attacking the power grid. They even had a guy on camera—some "city planner" who was definitely an actor—crying and asking why we were "terrorists" who wanted to make civilians suffer.

Myrr wasn't looking at the screens; he was looking at his analog instruments. "The nodes are clean, Lem," he said, his voice trembling. "There's no power signature here. We're looking at live radio waves—I can see the Core's own signal tripping the grid from inside the Spire. They turned off the lights themselves just to make us look like the bad guys."

Our tech could see the truth that the city's digital sensors could never catch, but it didn't matter. The lie was already halfway around the world. Myrr realized the trap: we weren't liberators anymore. 

"If that’s what they want us to be," Myrr whispered, his voice turning cold as ice, "then let’s finish the job."

He ordered the push toward the desert base, but the tide turned instantly. General Tor’s massive flagship, the *Obsidian Sledge*, dropped out of the thermal haze like an iron mountain. And then came Rahu. He was a ghost in the dust, his machine painted the color of the dunes. Myrr’s crew had trained in the quiet halls of the forest, but they’d never seen a real battle. Rahu didn't miss. Our first command ship went down in a massive fireball. The White Forest crew panicked, seeing their friends burn. They hit the retreat button, abandoning the Tree Army to be incinerated by the Core's iron wrath. The remaining forces withdrew toward the northern mountains.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The assault on Cradle Zero was a victory for the Core's propaganda before the first spear of wood even touched the wall. Myrr’s warriors struck at the enemy’s nodes, correctly identifying them as the pillars of their command network. But as the towers fell, the Core enacted a calculated betrayal: they manually severed the power to the entire city. In a heartbeat, the Hive’s media was flooded with images of the darkness we had "caused." A weeping puppet of the Hive begged for mercy on every screen, accusing us of knowing that these were vital power stations. 

Myrr watched the lights of the city go out, but his analog sensors told a different story. They captured the high-fidelity wave of a central Core override—a digital signal that bypassed all safety protocols to plunge the city into shadow. "They're killing the grid themselves, Lem," Myrr whispered, his voice like grinding stone. "Our instruments can see the fingerprint of the Spire's command. The nodes are empty shells, but the world will only see the darkness they blame on us."

He realized that in the eyes of the world, we weren't liberators. We were the monsters the Core had always warned them would come. “If they want monsters," Myrr said, "let us show them what a monster can do.”

But the darkness we brought was matched by a shadow from the horizon. The *Obsidian Sledge*, the great iron whale of General Tor, broke through the desert haze. Then came Rahu. He was a ghost in the shimmering heat, a wolf among sheep. Myrr’s crew had trained in the quiet halls of the forest, but Rahu had been forged in the fire of a thousand wars. When our great command ships began to bloom into torches of fire and screaming wood, the heart of our army broke. The retreat was a panicked scramble into the North, leaving our wooden brothers to be burnt to cinders by the Core’s iron wrath. The remaining forces withdrew toward the northern mountains.
### Lem
- **The Analyst of Defeat:** Lem observes the precision of the Core’s propaganda machine, noting that narrative control is more effective than physical armor.
- **Variable Observer:** He identifies Rahu as a superior tactical variable, noting the disparity between the White Forest's theoretical training and Rahu's practical lethality.

### Myrr
- **The Moral Collapse:** He is devastated by the realization that their cause is being rewritten in real-time.
- **The Tactical Realist:** He accepts the "Terrorist" designation as an unavoidable consequence of the mission.
- **The Defeated Commander:** He experiences the first major failure of his new leadership.
