# Chapter 7: The Sacrifice

**Setting:** Lunar surface (combat zone); Hermes command bridge; Lunar pyramid interior
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)
1. Rahu, a Synodic Fire Vessel of normal human size, manifests as a profound threat on a tall mountain peak, wreathed in flame; from this high position, he operates a massive plasma array that fires an unlimited barrage, pinning down human forces.
2. The ground forces are completely exposed on the open plain with no cover against the mysterious plasma technology arcing down from above. This desperate situation creates a tactical kill zone.
3. Plasma discharges erupt from hidden emplacements; the energy arcs toward the bike fleet and the "Strider" units containing "Gorgons," destroying lead units and scattering the human formation into canyons.
4. The mission reaches a breaking point as ground forces are trapped; in this moment of desperation, Tor makes the command decision to sacrifice the *Hermes* to clear a path.
5. Before the arcs close, *Hermes* bursts through the debris field and sweeps a corridor clear; the resulting exchange destroys both Rahu and the *Hermes*.
6. Iris Novak assumes command via general comms (unseen by Lem) and announces plainly that Tor's sacrifice cleared the corridor, saved the ground forces, and preserved the mission; she orders the operation to continue without delay.
7. The ground destabilizes and equipment fails as the strike force reaches the center of the disintegrating base.
8. Novak orders an evacuation into the massive central pyramid; the atmosphere stabilizes upon entry and ground teams deploy seals across the doors.
9. Tor arrives later (in Ch 7), leaving the chapter on a note of operational uncertainty within the sanctuary.
**POV:** Lem


## Draft
Rahu stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position, he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, sending an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. On the radio, pilots gave disorganized orders.

Trying to avoid the plasma, the bike fleet moved into the canyons while ground forces remained trapped on the open plain. We were completely exposed, with no cover against the mysterious spheres arcing down from the mountain peak. As the plasma targeted us from above, the situation became a kill zone where strike meant total destruction. It was a moment of absolute desperation.

The ship *Hermes* flew through the debris field and cleared a corridor, drawing the reaction of the plasma spheres. Some hit the ground to cause electrical discharges in the gullies while others struck the *Hermes* as it fired its batteries. In the resulting collision, Rahu's core and the *Hermes* were both destroyed, leaving only heat, smoke, and a sudden quiet.

Though I couldn't see her, Iris Novak's steady voice came over the general comms, telling everyone to calm down. She claimed Tor had simplified the battlefield by clearing the path and explained that the sacrifice was necessary to save the mission. Taking command, she ordered us all forward toward the objective, though the ground under our route was unstable and shifted as we drove over it.

We entered the pyramid. The air was stable inside. The noise of the battle outside died away, leaving us in a heavy silence. Ground teams moved ahead, sliding seal plates into the jambs and locking the massive doors behind them — the seals were being deployed, not found. Novak looked at the closed doors ahead of us. We were inside, but the mission was far from over.

## Synopsis
Rahu manifests as a profound threat; human forces are pinned down by flame.

## Chapter Outline

1. **The Tactical Zone:** The plain leading to the lunar base is an open surface with no geometric cover. From the mountain peak, Rahu launches a continuous stream of blue plasma spheres. The spheres arc down and strike any vehicle that moves onto the plain.
2. **The Bottleneck:** The human fleet is pinned behind a ridge. The comms are filled with overlapping reports of vehicle failure.
3. **The Transit of *Hermes*:** The flagship *Hermes* moves from its orbital position and enters the lower atmosphere. It descends directly into the path of the plasma spheres.
4. **The Collision:** Thousands of plasma spheres divert from the plain and converge on the *Hermes*. The ship’s hull glows blue before a large thermal discharge occurs. The peak of the mountain and the ship are obscured by light. When the smoke clears, neither Rahu nor the *Hermes* are visible.
5. **Command Shift:** Iris Novak’s voice comes over the general channel. She states that the corridor is clear. She orders all units to advance toward the central pyramid.
6. **The Advance:** Lem drives his hovercraft across the plain. He passes the wreckage of the bikes and the remains of several Striders. The ground vibrates as if the rock itself is fracturing.
7. **Entry:** The strike force reaches the pyramid. The massive doors are open. The air inside is still.
8. **Securing the Perimeter:** Ground teams deploy heavy metal seals across the entry jambs. They lock the plates into position. The sound of the battle outside is muffled by the stone.
9. **The Silence:** The ground teams wait in the central hall. Lem records the steady drip of fluid from his hovercraft and the sound of the soldiers' breathing.

## Character Arc

**General Tor:**
- His ship is used to clear the path for the ground forces.
- His voice is absent from the comms after the collision.

**Iris Novak:**
- She assumes leadership and provides instructions for the pyramid entry.
- Her voice is steady over the radio.

**Lem’s Record:**
- **Atmospheric Data:** Lem notes the shift in air pressure and temperature upon entering the pyramid.
- **Physical Details:** He records the deployment of the door seals and the visual details of the hall.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Vessel Engagement:**
- The *Hermes* is destroyed by a high-density plasma discharge.
- **The Pyramid:** A structure that does not vibrate with the rest of the lunar surface.

✅ **Aetheric Mechanics:**
- The "Mission Link" remains active, but the instructions are now confined to the interior of the pyramid.

✅ **Tone:**
- Clinical and heavy. The destruction of the *Hermes* is described through its physical impact on the tactical situation.
- The chapter ends with the silence inside the pyramid.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions about internal states (transformation, confusion, resilience). Describe the physical evidence: silence, radio reports, metal seals.
- Avoid scientific jargon; describe Rahu's power as "blue plasma spheres."
- Balance discovery: Lem notes that he later learned Tor's decision was a "sacrifice," but for now, he only records the movement of the ship.
