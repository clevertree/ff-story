# Chapter 21: The Return to the North

**Timeline:** 
1. Reverting to the old ruins; finding the "Arsenal Blueprint."
2. Manifestation of the Analog Hovercraft – a vehicle of wood and aether.
3. The flight over the Hive; seeing the scale of the Core's expansion.
4. Arrival in the North; the shock that the "threatened" villages are still there.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Finding the "Arsenal Blueprint" in the ruins.

## Draft
I traveled back to the northern region. I searched the structures that were not marked on the current maps.

I found a set of schematics in the basement of a destroyed mill. The documents contained technical instructions for building machinery that does not require a network connection to operate. I labeled this document the Arsenal Blueprint. It included a list of parts: frame couplers, bearing housings, and spline joints. These instructions allowed us to use salvaged materials to build functional units.

We used the blueprint to begin construction. We had the necessary materials. We began to reassemble the machines.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
