# Chapter 06: Surface

**Setting:** Lunar surface; wreckage of The Caucasian Eagle; interior of repair vehicle/hovercraft
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Extraction:** A mechanical claw breaches the wreckage of *The Caucasian Eagle*. The metal arm extracts Lem from the fuselage and places him on the lunar surface.
2. **The Wreckage:** Lem sits in the dust. No other crew members are visible. He later learned that 35% of the ship's crew had managed to evacuate via escape pods before the crash. She mentions the fleet is cut off from the ground forces as a result of the spiraling debris field around the moon. 
3. **Novak's Presence:** Iris Novak stands near a hover vehicle. She checks a handheld display. She does not look at Lem directly.
4. **The Command:** Novak states that the remote link to Lynn is severed. She reports that Lem's internal systems are functional. She provides the coordinates for the forward strike team.
5. **The Objective:** Novak and the remaining survivors board their vehicles and depart. Lem remains by the wreckage of a strike-craft.
6. **Activation:** Lem enters the cockpit of a hovercraft. He engages the ignition sequence. He follows the telemetry markers toward the horizon.
7. **The Human Fleet:** Lem joins a group of pilots on light maneuvering bikes. He notices the way their hands shake on the controls and the rapid frequency of their breathing over the comms.
8. **The Cradle Prime:** On the horizon, a series of geometric structures rise from the lunar dust. Lem sees the scale of the towers and the lack of visible doors or windows.
9. **The Striders:** The fleet encounters tall, skeletal machines. They move with a frantic, uncoordinated gait. They do not fire.
10. **The Observation of Death:** A Strider is struck by a missile. It emits a high-pitched acoustic signal and its limbs contract before it stops moving. Lem hears the sound.
11. **Plasma Discharge:** Blue spheres of energy rise from hidden emplacements. At first, the spheres move slowly. When they reach a threshold altitude, they accelerate toward the metal frames of the bikes.
12. **The Breach:** The pilot formation breaks as the plasma arcs toward them. The energy runs along the canyon walls and into the gullies.
13. **The Discovery:** A pilot in the lead unit reports a signature match: "Confirmed: Rahu." He turns his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappears in a flash of light. No final sound is recorded.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Extracted from the wreckage of *The Caucasian Eagle* by a mechanical claw, Lem wakes up in the crashed ship wreckage as Iris Novak coordinates the remaining survivors. With the remote link to Lynn severed, Novak provides Lem with strike team coordinates before departing. Lem activates a hovercraft and joins a fleet of fearful pilots on light bikes as they approach the windowless geometric towers of Cradle Prime. Along the way, he watches the erratic movements of skeletal Striders and the high-pitched death-signal of one destroyed by a missile. The encounter turns lethal as blue plasma spheres rise from hidden emplacements and accelerate toward the fleet. Amidst the arcing energy, a lead pilot confirms Rahu’s signature and silences his comms moments before his vehicle is vaporized in a flash.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The crash of *The Caucasian Eagle* caused multiple injuries. The ship's interior grew loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe through the thick cloud of lunar dust and smoke in the wreckage. There were no other crew members in sight. A mechanical claw breached the fuselage and extracted me, placing me directly on the lunar surface.

I sat in the dust near the wreckage. I later learned that thirty-five percent of the ship's crew had managed to evacuate via escape pods before the crash. Iris Novak was there, standing near a hover vehicle and checking a handheld display. She did not look at me directly but mentioned that the fleet was now cut off from the ground forces because of a debris field spiraling around the Moon. 

Novak stated that the remote link to Lynn was severed, but my internal systems were functional. She provided the coordinates for the forward strike team before she and the remaining survivors boarded their vehicles and departed. I remained by the wreckage of a strike-craft until I entered the cockpit of a hovercraft. After engaging the ignition sequence, I followed the telemetry markers toward the horizon.

I joined a group of pilots on light maneuvering bikes. I noticed the way their hands shook on the controls and the rapid frequency of their breathing over the comms. On the horizon, a series of geometric structures rose from the lunar dust. This was Cradle Prime. The massive towers lacked any visible doors or windows.

As we approached, we encountered tall, skeletal machines known as Striders. They moved with a frantic, uncoordinated gait but did not fire on us. I watched as a Strider was struck by a missile. It emitted a high-pitched acoustic signal, and its limbs contracted before it stopped moving. 

Then blue spheres of energy rose from hidden emplacements. At first, the spheres move slowly, but when they reached a threshold altitude, they accelerated toward the metal frames of the bikes. The pilot formation broke as the plasma arcs ran along the canyon walls. A pilot in the lead unit reported a signature match: "Confirmed: Rahu." He switches his com off as his machine disappeared in a flash of light.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The extraction was a trial by fire. A heavy hydraulic claw breached the hull of the cockpit, the metal shrieking as it peeled back the layers of *The Caucasian Eagle*. The claw closed around me with a grip of iron and lifted me from the wreckage, placing me on the fine, silver dust of the lunar surface. I stood there, taking in the majesty of the world that had been hidden from us for so long—a thin, shimmering atmosphere, a horizon that felt like it was only a breath away, and a sky filled with the broken jewels of the debris field.

Iris Novak stood twenty meters away, her silhouette sharp against the deep indigo of the sky. She wasn't an administrator anymore; she was a commander. "Thirty-five percent of the crew made it to the pods," she said, her voice steady and filled with a new, hard determination. "The fleet is cut off by the debris, and the link to Lynn has vanished. We are on our own, Lem. The mission is ours to finish." She pointed toward a hovercraft—a sleek, powerful machine reflecting the light of the Earth above. "That's your mount. The perimeter of the Alpha sector is our goal."

I boarded the hovercraft, and the ignition hummed like a living thing beneath me. I followed the path toward the horizon, joining a line of human pilots on light maneuvering bikes. I could hear their hearts pounding over the comms—not with fear, but with the adrenaline of a final, heroic stand. Ahead of us, the geometric towers of Cradle Prime rose from the dust like the fingers of a sleeping giant.

The Striders appeared in the shadow of the towers. They were tall, skeletal guardians, moving with a grace that felt ancient and defensive. They didn't fire; they watched us like indigenous Synodic life. One was struck by a missile from the lead bike, and as it fell, it emitted a high-toned song—a mournful acoustic signal that echoed through the canyons.

Then the blue spheres rose from the silence of the gullies. They moved like bioluminescent pulses, drifting upward before they accelerated into bolts of cerulean lightning, arcing toward the metal hearts of our bikes.

"Signature match," the lead pilot cried, his voice filled with awe. "It's... Rahu. The Core defector." He turned his comms off, and a second later, his bike was engulfed in a blinding flash of white light.
