## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Purity Shield' was the last wall between the Core and the Shore. It was a barrier of 'Perfect Geometry'—an absolute refusal of the wild, chaotic growth of the Wood. To break it, I couldn't use force. I had to use 'The Flaw.'

I revisited the 'Sanitary' records of the Archivists. I found the one thing they couldn't sanitize—the face of a mother looking for her child during the Great Fry. It was a fragment of 'High-Frequency Grief' that resonated at a level the geometry couldn't handle.

I projected that grief against the shield. The wall didn't crack; it began to vibrate with the frequency of the human heart. The 'Purity' was a lie; it was just a lack of context. By providing the context, I turned the shield into a mirror.

I watched as the Core’s own guardians looked into the mirror and saw the people they had 'Sanitized.' The shield dissolved into a rain of silver light. The way to the 'Shore' was finally open.

I walked through the ruins of the last gate. I wasn't just a soldier anymore. I was the 'Herald of the Heart.'
