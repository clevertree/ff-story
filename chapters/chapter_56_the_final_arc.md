## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Scramble:** Realizing the main battle is a stalemate, the Crew pivots to a final, desperate plan. They form a second assault group using another 25% of their remaining arsenal.
2.  **The Infiltration Fleet:** This group is composed of fast-moving ships, bikes, and hovercrafts. They are small, low-profile, and designed for speed over endurance.
3.  **The High-Stakes Path:** Most of the Crew boards the larger ships. They take an aggressive arc away from the massive Monolith engagement, seeking a path into the center of the desert base.
4.  **The Gamble:** Their hope is that the Core's terrestrial defenses are entirely depleted or committed to the main front. They gamble that the Archivists will not risk landing more "meteorites" near the base's delicate infrastructure.
5.  **The Dash into the Base:** The chapter ends with the infiltration fleet screaming across the dunes at low altitude, the "Battle of Trees" still raging behind them as a fire-lit horizon. They are making a final run for the heart of the machine.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The pace of this chapter should be frantic and high-speed, contrasting with the slow, massive movements of Chapter 55.
-   Describe the feeling of the hovercraft cockpit—claustrophobic, vibrating with aetheric power, and filled with the silent tension of the Crew.
