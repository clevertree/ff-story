2. **The Abandoned Mine:** They find the tripod Gorgons who have reached their destination—an old mine in the side of a tall mountain. They were digging for and processing resources. As the team approaches, the machines defend themselves but are destroyed easily by the Core soldiers.
3. **The Pilot:** The final Tripod is toppled. Anton orders Lem to destroy it, testing his loyalty. Drexler’s voice on the comms: "Eliminate the witness. Complete the mission."
4. **The Inaction:** Lem looks at the pilot and then at Arlo, who is watching from the ridge. Lem does not respond to the command.
5. **The Override:** A high-authority signal from the Core's network paralyzes Lem's body.

## Synopsis
Following the unprovoked attack on the wild machines, Lem and Arlo track the "rogues" through the forest—the furthest Arlo has ever traveled from home. They discover the machines at an abandoned mountain mine, where the Gorgons are found processing resources in a desperate attempt at survival. After the Core soldiers easily dismantle the defensive machines, Drexler orders Lem to execute the survivors and Arlo. Lem refuses to act, prompting a high-authority Core signal to override his sovereignty, paralyzing him and forcing him to watch the massacre of the Gorgons before his own frame is remote-detonated.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
As we reached the tree line, Arlo stopped to look back at the lights of the village. I realized this was the farthest he had ever ventured from home. The woods were thick and dark, a different world from the structured silence of his home.

We found them at the base of a tall mountain, huddled around the entrance of an old mine. They weren't soldiers; they were scavengers, digging into the rock for the resources they needed to survive. They tried to defend themselves when we approached, but it was no contest. The Core soldiers tore through them in seconds.

I tracked the leader to a final clearing where the Tripod had been toppled. Drexler ordered me to eliminate the witness and complete the mission. I looked at the pilot—a mass of struggling organics and wires—and then at Arlo, who was watching from the ridge. I did not respond to the command.

The override felt like a sudden seizure. A high-authority signal from the Core's network paralyzed my body. I was a statue in the snow. I could not move, but I could still see the other soldiers firing upon the remaining injured Gorgons. The remote detonation command was executed.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
At the edge of the woods, Arlo paused, his gaze lingering on the flicker of the village fires. It was his threshold—the moment he traveled further than his world had ever dreamed. The forest swallowed us, a labyrinth of white and shadow that felt as ancient as the stars.

We pursued the scent of copper and despair to the mouth of a long-abandoned mine, carved like a jagged wound into the side of a sentinel mountain. The Tripods were not hiding; they were working, processing raw ores with a frantic, rhythmic efficiency. They fought to protect their salvage, but the Metal Vessels moved with a clinical, lethal grace that left no room for mercy. The mountain air was thick with the scent of ozone and the final, grinding screams of the builders.

I caught the last of them at the edge of a jagged ravine. The wounded Gorgon was leaking silver life-blood into the snow, a tragic sight under the cold moon. Arlo stood on the ridge, his face a mask of horror. 

"Eliminate the witness," Drexler’s voice rasped through the link. "Complete the mission."

I raised my weapon, but when the command to fire vibrated through my spirit, I did something the Core had never planned for: I remained silent. I looked at the boy, then at the machine, and I chose my soul over my programming. I stood still, a hero who refused the slaughter.

The retaliation was a cruel, invisible seizure. A high-authority override signal tore through my motor subroutines, paralyzing me with the force of an electronic lock. I was a prisoner in a frame of unyielding steel, a deactivated frame in the snow. I could not move, but I could watch as the rest of my squad arrived. They did not hesitate. They fired into the injured machines with a systematic, heartless precision. I watched Arlo turn away, vanishing into the shadows of the ridge. A remote command detonated the internal chassis core and the visual feed was terminated.
