# Chapter 06: Alone on the Moon

**Setting:** Lunar surface; wreckage of The Caucasian Eagle; interior of repair vehicle/hovercraft
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)
1. **Extraction:** A mechanical claw breaches the wreckage of *The Caucasian Eagle*. The metal arm extracts Lem from the fuselage and places him on the lunar surface.
2. **The Wreckage:** Lem sits in the dust. No other crew members are visible. He later learned that 60% of the ship's crew had already evacuated via escape pods while he was in the wreckage.
3. **Novak's Presence:** Iris Novak stands near a hover vehicle. She checks a handheld display. She does not look at Lem directly.
4. **The Command:** Novak states that the remote link to Lynn is severed. She reports that Lem's internal systems are functional. She provides the coordinates for the forward strike team.
5. **The Objective:** Novak and the remaining survivors board their vehicles and depart. Lem remains by the wreckage of a strike-craft.
6. **Activation:** Lem enters the cockpit of a hovercraft. He engages the ignition sequence. He follows the telemetry markers toward the horizon.
7. **The Human Fleet:** Lem joins a group of pilots on light maneuvering bikes. He records the way their hands shake on the controls and the rapid frequency of their breathing over the comms.
8. **The Apex Hub:** On the horizon, a series of geometric structures rise from the lunar dust. Lem records the scale of the towers and the lack of visible doors or windows.
9. **The Striders:** The fleet encounters tall, skeletal machines. They move with a frantic, uncoordinated gait. They do not fire.
10. **The Observation of Death:** A Strider is struck by a missile. It emits a high-pitched acoustic signal and its limbs contract before it stops moving. Lem records the sound.
11. **Plasma Discharge:** Blue spheres of energy rise from hidden emplacements. At first, the spheres move slowly. When they reach a threshold altitude, they accelerate toward the metal frames of the bikes.
12. **The Breach:** The pilot formation breaks as the plasma arcs toward them. The energy runs along the canyon walls and into the gullies.
13. **The Discovery:** A pilot in the lead unit reports a signature match: "Confirmed: Rahu." He turns his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappears in a flash of light. No final sound is recorded.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem experiences the crash and slips into a disorienting Aether-Drive fugue.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The crash caused multiple injuries as the ship's interior grew loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe, alone in the wreckage; there were no other crew members in sight.

Before I could look around, a machine removed me from the wreckage. Iris Novak was there, looking over a handheld display. She had already initiated the extraction. She didn't look at me at first. I heard a report coming through her headset. Someone was telling her the final numbers on the evacuation of the ship I had just been on. They said sixty percent of the crew had made it to the escape pods.

It turned out Iris and her team were among those who had escaped. I hadn't seen them leave; I had been left behind in the chaos.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

I clawed my way out of the wreckage, my systems rebooting in a haze of static. The lunar dust was a fine, grey shroud, settling over the twisted remains of *The Caucasian Eagle*. I was Wood—structure and resilience—but even I felt the hollow ache of the silence. Ahead, Iris Novak stood framed against the indigo sky, her silhouette sharp and clinical as she monitored the extraction. She didn't look back to see if I followed; her focus was already a mile ahead, buried in the data of the dead and the evacuated.

"Sixty percent," she murmured to the empty air, her voice a cold tally of the escape pods. I was the remainder.

I took the controls of a hovercraft, the ignition hum a low growl that vibrated through my frame. I joined the skeletal line of the fleet, a handful of light bikes weaving through the canyons like chrome insects. Over the open channel, I could hear the pilots—their breath was a frantic, ragged rhythm, a sharp contrast to the silent, geometric towers of the Apex Hub rising from the dust.

Then the Striders appeared—tall, spindly machines that moved with the jerky, uncoordinated gait of a puppet on tangled strings. They didn't fire; they simply watched with unblinking acoustic sensors. But the air suddenly crackled with ozone. Spheres of blue plasma rose from the gullies, drifting upward like slow-moving stars.

"Target identified," the lead pilot hissed, his voice trembling with a realization that transcended his training. "It's... Rahu." He cut his comms, a final act of privacy. A sphere touched his bike, and the mountain wall flared into a blinding brilliance. When the light faded, there was nothing left but a memory of heat.

## Character Arc
**Lem's Record:**
- **Post-Impact Recovery:** Lem records the physical details of the wreckage—the smell of hydraulic fluid and the silence of the moon.
- **Biometric Observation:** He catalogs the physical indicators of stress in the human pilots: shifting heart rates and rapid speech.

**The Striders:**
- Lem records their movement as uncoordinated and reactive. He notes the acoustic signals they emit when destroyed.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Lunar Atmosphere:**
- Lem can breathe the air on the lunar surface. He notes the way the dust settles and the smell of ozone.
- **Apex Hub:** Large, geometric structures of unknown material.

✅ **Aetheric Mechanics:**
- The automated "Mission Link" provides coordinates to Lem's vision but does not control his limbs.

✅ **Tone:**
- Clinical and quiet. The transition from the wreckage to the battle is described through physical shifts—the drone of the engines and the visual markers of the plasma.
- The chapter ends with the pilot's silence.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions about internal states (pain, empathy, empathy). Describe the physical evidence: acoustic signals, contracted limbs, silence.
- Avoid scientific jargon; describe plasma as "blue spheres" and the aether-drive as "vision markers."
- Balance discovery: Lem notes that he later identified the Striders as "Gorgons," but for now, they are only tall, skeletal machines.
