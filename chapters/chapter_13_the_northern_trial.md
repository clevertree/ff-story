# Chapter 13: The Northern Trial

**Setting:** Frozen North; Arlo's Village; Engagement Zone
**Timeline:** Year 16 AT (Mission 3)
1. Lem is briefed on "uncooperative" northern villages and the need for diplomatic/military presence.
2. Rapid deployment to the frozen north, contrasting sharply with the Hive's desert heat.
3. Lem observe the villagers' distrust of technology and their reliance on oral tradition.
4. Lem meets **Arlo**, a technology-fascinated boy who is shunned by his elders for helping the Corps.
5. A violent conflict is reported in Rahu's region; Lem's village goes on high alert.
6. Massive Tripods approach the village but unexpectedly walk around it, focused on a different destination.
7. A soldier under Lem's command fires at a machine, triggering an immediate and violent response.
8. Lem records that the machines remained non-aggressive until the soldier fired; the threat followed a sequence of provocation.
9. The Core orders Lem to track the retreating Tripods in the forest.
10. A damaged pilot is ejected from the final Tripod; it remains stationary in the snow.
11. Drexler orders Lem to eliminate the pilot; Lem remains stationary.
12. A remote detonation is triggered; Lem's vision records the message "Objective Met" before the signal cuts.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The Core identifies the "uncooperative" northern villages; diplomatic and military escalation begins.

## Chapter Outline

1. **Mission 3 Briefing:** Northern villages have not accepted the Core beacons.
2. **Environmental Shift:** Transition from desert Hive to frozen wilderness.
3. **The Village Entry:** Lem and his crew enter the settlement; the inhabitants do not use digital devices.
4. **Arlo's Introduction:** Meeting a boy who handles old technology.
5. **The Distant Fire:** Detection of energy signatures from Rahu's region; village sensors go to high alert.
6. **The Anomaly:** Tripods approach but ignore the village; they follow a rhythmic path.
7. **The Strike:** The soldier's shot triggers a change in machine behavior.
8. **The Hunt:** Core orders the destruction of the Tripods; Lem tracks them into the forest.
9. **The Pilot:** The final Tripod is toppled; a biological/mechanical hybrid is ejected.
10. **The Order:** Drexler’s voice on the comms: "Complete the mission."
11. **The Inaction:** Lem does not respond to the command.
12. **The Detonation:** High-priority signal triggers the core; Lem's frame is destroyed.

## Character Arc

**Lem's Observations:**
- He records the behavior of the soldiers versus the mission propaganda.
- Observation that his movements are controlled by the Core's expansion requirements.
- The remote detonation confirms his status as a modular asset.

**Arlo's Conflict:**
- He handles technology in secrecy.
- He observes the destruction of the military units.
- He does not accept the Archivists' invitation for relocation.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Facts Applied:**
- Non-Tech Societies: Marginalized groups that reject the "digital witchcraft" of the Core.
- Tripod/Gorgon Routines: Non-aggressive when following internal biological/mechanical directives.
- Heat Rays (Invisible): The devastating, silent effectiveness of Synodic weaponry.
- The "Moral Void": The Core's willingness to erase its own elite assets to enforce total compliance.
- Tech Beacons: Used to force settlements into dependency through manufactured conflict.

✅ **The Northern Front:**
- Environmental hazards: Icy winds, deep snow, and electronic interference from the trees.
- The "Witch Maya" rumors: Subtle hints that another Vessel once protected this region.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
