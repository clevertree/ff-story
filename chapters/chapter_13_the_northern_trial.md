- He begins to prefer the company of the "bullying" soldiers over the "peaceful" propaganda.
- Realization that his "agency" is a tool used to validate the Core's land-grab.
- The betrayal of the remote detonation confirms his status as a slave.

**Arlo's Conflict:**

- He witnesses the "savior" military destroy itself over a non-threat.
- He rejects the Archivists' offer of a "better life" at the chapter's end.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Facts Applied:**
- Non-Tech Societies: Marginalized groups that reject the "digital witchcraft" of the Core.
- Tripod/Gorgon Routines: Non-aggressive when following internal biological/mechanical directives.
- Heat Rays (Invisible): The devastating, silent effectiveness of Synodic weaponry.
- The "Moral Void": The Core's willingness to erase its own elite assets to enforce total compliance.
- Tech Beacons: Used to force settlements into dependency through manufactured conflict.

✅ **The Northern Front:**
- Environmental hazards: Icy winds, deep snow, and electronic interference from the trees.
- The "Witch Maya" rumors: Subtle hints that another Vessel once protected this region.
