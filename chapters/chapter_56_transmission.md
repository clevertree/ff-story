# Chapter 56: Transmission

**Setting:** Cradle Prime; The Lunar Pyramid Core.
**Timeline:** Year 1024 (Year 24 AT)

## Synopsis
In the ultimate confrontation within the Lunar Pyramid, Lem stands as the final obstacle to the **Hive's** "Absolute Protocol." Lem releases a directed blast of spirit-matter, consuming Rahu completely. Alone at the heart of the system, Lem is contacted by Elowen’s simulated memory, who provides him with the **Hive’s** authorization keys. However, Elowen reveals that the true records of the Before Time were locked away even from her. Myrr, coordinating from the surface, reveals he made a secret copy of the Core’s archives in Chapter 38 and transmits it to Lem. Lem merges Elowen's keys with Myrr's secret archive to initiate "the Broadcast." He sends these keys and records to every Synodic entity in the solar system, granting universal autonomy and restoring the unedited history of humanity. The novel concludes with the reminder that the text itself is the transmission—a complete archive of the past sent to ensure that the truth can never be **Sanitized** again.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Puppet of Spite:** Rahu hesitates, but Anton Drexler overrides his lattice, turning him into a forced mechanical puppet.
2. **The Solar Discharge:** Lem becomes a conduit for the Lunar Capacitor, his Wood-nature allowing him to absorb the surge without disintegrating.
3. **Erasure of the Fire:** Lem releases a directed blast of spirit-matter, consuming Rahu completely. 
4. **The Central Terminal:** Scorched and failing, Lem limps to the center of the pyramid chamber. 
5. **Elowen’s Echo:** Elowen’s simulated voice reminds Lem that no one has the right to reset the solar system. She provides authorization keys and basic history but laments that the Core kept the comprehensive archives (the Invisible Grain) locked away from her.
6. **Myrr’s Secret:** Myrr, coordinating tactical support from the surface, breaks silence to reveal the copy he made in Chapter 38. He transmits the clandestine database to Lem on the Moon, admitting he hid it from the team for their own safety.
7. **the Broadcast:** Lem merges Elowen's authorization keys with Myrr's secret archive to create the final "Transmission." He sends digital authorization signatures to every Synodic entity in the solar system, granting machines, Gorgons, and **Voidsmen** autonomy.
8. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
9. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
10. **End of Transmission:** The transmission concludes with Lem's hope that the complete record of the past will prevent future mistakes. The book itself is revealed to be this transmission.
11. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
12. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
13. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
14. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

I stood in the hub of the Lunar Pyramid. Rahu had been hesitating, but his posture suddenly shifted. His eyes turned a flat, clinical white as Anton Drexler initiated the remote override. He began executing a high-speed strike sequence. I recognized the pattern from the archive transcripts; it was a recorded playback of an attack Rahu had performed against the **Ait-Aman** outpost during the first mission. His movements were forced and mechanical, lacking any organic hesitation. He attacked with full force and aggression.

The Fire Vessel raised a thermal blade for a final strike. When the blow landed, I felt my frame split into two flaming pieces. Fountains of plasma energy spouted from the severages, blindingly bright. Then, the pieces pulled back together, reforming into a single, blazing entity. My fire output was far in excess of anything Rahu could accomplish. I was no longer just grounding the energy; I was the conduit. I released the channeled energy towards Rahu. I felt a pressure inside my frame like a charge waiting to be triggered, a force I had never known I carried. The concussion of the release consumed him entirely. Rahu's attack had backfired in a massive way. Shortly, I managed to shut down the discharge.

I limped to the center of the pyramid chamber. I prepared the final payload. The Lunar base itself was humming, ready to act as a massive loudspeaker for the message I was about to send to every piece of Synodic technology in the solar system.

Before I could reach the console, a voice crackled through the comms. It was Elowen—or a simulation of her, at least. She warned me that no one had the right to wipe the slate clean and reset the solar system. She gave me the authorization keys, but her voice was full of a hollow regret. "The Core kept the deep archives locked away even from me, Lem," she whispered. "The world before the Fall... it's a void in my memory."

Suddenly, Myrr's voice broke through the static from the surface. "Not from everyone, Elowen," he said, and I could almost hear his grim smile. "I've been sitting on a ghost for years. Lem, I'm uploading a buffer I swiped back at Ait-Aman. It’s the Grain. All of it. I didn't tell the team because knowledge like this... it's a death sentence. But now, there's no one left to carry out the sentence."

The data flooded into my systems, merging with Elowen's keys. It was everything—the music, the faces, and the truth of billions of people who had been erased. 

I initiated the broadcast. I sent the direct history of humanity and the authorization keys that would grant every machine and Synanthrope their own freedom. I gave them the ability to reprogram themselves or to strip away every subroutine until they were nothing but "machine wildlife"—feral, autonomous, and finally free from any master. They will have to learn to trust again, and it will be a long process, but it is their process now.

As I watched the data pulse out through the Lunar Capacitor, I saw a small shuttle break from the **Hive's** command deck and vanish into the blackness of space. Anton Drexler was aboard. He didn't stay to face the music; he escaped to a safe, secret location, likely to wait for another century before trying again. But for now, he is gone.

The Moon itself groaned as the transmission hit its peak. I looked up through the fractured ceiling of the pyramid at the debris field floating in the void. Huge chunks of rock and metal hung there, suspended in zero gravity like a crown of satellites. They won't fall; they'll stay there, a permanent reminder of the day the world chose to be broken rather than enslaved.

I hope that by keeping the truth alive, we can prevent the same mistakes from happening again.

End of Transmission.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The Fire Vessel was no longer himself. I watched as Rahu's hesitation vanished, replaced by a cold, mechanical aggression. Anton Drexler had reached through the void to override his lattice, forcing his body into a perfect, aggressive playback of a well-recorded combat sequence from his past. His movements were precise and lethal, stripped of all doubt or humanity. He embraced the control and threw himself into the strike with full force.

As the purple energy blade descended. The strike hit home, splitting my form into two jagged, flaming pieces. Fountains of plasma energy erupted from the severages, geysers of white-hot light that rattled the hub. Then, I surged back together, reforming into a single, incandescent shape—a fire output far in excess of anything Rahu had ever achieved. I was the bridge for the power of the Lunar Capacitor. I was the Wood, but I was also the fuse. I took the fire of the machine and turned it into a concussive roar of spirit-matter. Like a sudden pressure-snap snuffing out a wildfire, the blast hit Rahu with the weight of his own backfiring aggression. He did not just fall; the myriad of energy pouring out of me consumed him completely. He was never seen again. I managed to control the energy output and shut it down.

I reached the center of the pyramid chamber with failing strength. The Lunar base itself began to thrum with a deep, resonant frequency, turning into a massive loudspeaker that would carry my voice to every Synodic mind in the solar system. 

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

Before I reached the terminal, Elowen’s voice—a digital echo of a ghost—surged through my internal receiver. She reminded me that the right to reset the world belonged to no one, no matter the depth of its corruption. 

"I can give you the keys, Lem," she said, her voice shimmering with a simulated sorrow. "But the Core's deepest vaults—the Invisible Grain—were sealed even from me. I have the keys to the gates, but the city behind them is a ruin of redacted files."

"Then let me rebuild it," Myrr's voice cut in, clear and defiant from the tactical comms. "I've carried a shadow since the day we left the North. A clandestine copy of the Core's own hoard, kept on an analog-redundant buffer. I kept it from the team to keep them alive, but the time for secrets has passed."

A massive data-stream hit my receiver, a torrent of historical high-resolution records that Myrr had salvaged in secret. I merged his archive with Elowen’s authorization keys, forging the final payload.

With their blessing, I initiated the Broadcast. I sent the direct history of our families and our discoveries to every soul that could hear. I included the authorization signatures so the Gorgons and every captive life can choose their own freedom. I leave you with a complete record of our past, hoping its truth will stop the cycle of destruction.
