# Chapter 1: Outpost


**Setting:** Lem's suburban home; Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Early), Years before Cataclysm

## Synopsis
Lem begins his record by detailing the nature of his memories—an analog stream beginning before his birth. He recalls a childhood of institutional routine and unexplained relocations, a sign of the Core's early influence on his path. He then traces the root of the coming conflict to 1971, when the Apollo 14 mission seeded the first Synodic toxins into the lunar surface under the guise of exploration.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Lem's Transmission / The Record of Senses:** Lem outlines the start of his memories to the recipients of the transmission. He notes that his analog memory contains the complete record of his vision and senses and begins abruptly around 9 months prior to his birthdate, although the input doesn't become clear for a long time - until around 5 months after he was born.
2. **The Institutional Routine / Genetic Anonymity:** He doesn't remember meeting his parents and knows nothing about them. Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine at the orphanage. He always remembers being called Lem, but has no idea who named him.
3. **The First Relocation / 3rd Grade Transition:** Lem went to school, but after a few years he would be moved from one to another in a different state. The reasons varied. The first time he was relocated happened in the 3rd grade mid-year was due supposedly due to his exceptional grades. He realized later that they had never actually asked him if he wanted to move. Instead they just informed him how lucky he was.
4. **The Second Relocation / 6th Grade Safety:** The 2nd time Lem moved was in the 6th grade. This time no apparent reason was given, however during a stern conversation with one of his handlers, he was told that the city he lived in was no longer safe, without providing any more context. Again he didn't resist the move, not having really been given a choice. Each time he moved he'd make a new set of friends.
5. **TODO: finalize Lem timeline**
6. **The Root of the Conflict / The 1971 Shards:** Lem summarizes the 1971 mission logs—the Apollo 14 impact and Dr. Vane’s terrestrial Synodic research.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

These are my memories. I am starting from the first thing I can remember and taking it through the five missions I was part of, up to the moment I send this transmission. I have tried to stick to the facts and keep my own opinions out of it. This story is a record of my memory, ending with the broadcast itself. The data is terminal, a final mission log preserved from the Before Time and the Core Technocracy. I want people to know the truth about the history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—what the Archive Transcripts call the Project Alpha activation—so these mistakes are not repeated.

I remember my childhood as a series of routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of the orphanage. My memory is pragmatic and sparse. It starts with a gap, followed by the abrupt start of my consciousness in a suburban setting. I did not have a family, so my days were all about timetables. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a beginning.

The conflict did not start in my lifetime. It began in February 1971, when the Apollo 14 mission intentionally crashed a booster into the Moon. The impact was not just for seismic data; it was the delivery system for the first shards. The Moon’s Far Side had once belonged to a forgotten people—the Selenites—but the 1971 infection changed everything. Dr. Elowen Vane had spent the previous two decades developing Synodic technology in a terrestrial lab. The Core used the Apollo mission to seed this toxin into the ancient lunar structures, allowing them to seize control of the base that would later be known as Cradle Prime.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

History isn't just a record of the past; it's a living shadow. My name is Lem, and I am a witness to the final days of the world I called home. I was born into a silence that felt like peace, never realizing that the sky above was gathering its strength for a storm that would unmake us all. This is the first transmission—the record of a journey into the heart of a cosmic mystery.

My early years were defined by the steady, rhythmic pulse of the city. I lived in an orphanage of gray stone and sun-drenched gardens, where time was measured in laughter and lessons. We felt safe. We felt permanent. We watched the news as the first anomalies appeared—signal leaks from the Moon that whispered of a hidden history. The world called them 'alien,' and we looked to the stars with a mix of wonder and dread.
