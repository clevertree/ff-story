**Timeline:** 202X (Early to Late), Years before Cataclysm
<!-- Sync test -->
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Transmission Preamble / Broadcast Initialization:** Lem explains that this book is a record of his memory, ending with the broadcast itself; description of the mission log and the terminal nature of the data.
2. **Early Life / The Temporal Anchor:** Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine; his memories are pragmatic and sparse, starting with the memory gap and the abrupt start of his consciousness in a suburban setting.
3. **The Root of the Conflict:** Lem summarizes the 1971 mission logs—the Apollo 14 impact and Dr. Vane’s terrestrial Synodic research.
4. **The False Discovery / Staged Leaks:** Amateur signal trackers break news of an "Alien Moon Base." In reality, these leaks were staged by the Core to justify their coming military coup.
5. **Culture of the Base / The Phenomenon:** Over several years, the news becomes a cultural divide. Neighborhood children begin playing "Tripod," mimicking the loping gait of the entities described in the leaks.
6. **The Transition of Normalcy / Neighborhood's Slow Breath:** Life remains superficially ordinary, but the tenor changes—curtains drawn, neighbors vanishing, and a constant hum of news bulletins in empty houses. Lem feels oddly detached from the growing panic.
7. **The Dissociative Generation:** Youth adoption of "tripods want to be left alone" stance and "deep-state whistleblower" conspiracy theories (Rahu) to cope with fear.
8. **The First Strike / Distant Fire:** Years after the first leaks, the first city falls to the massive "giant ape" monolith machines—deployed by the Core under the guise of an alien invasion.
9. **The Reluctant Unification:** As the monoliths prove unstoppable, national borders begin to blur. World governments, previously paralyzed by suspicion, start a slow, desperate merger of military forces—a 'do or die' consolidation that the Core quietly steers into a single global command.
10. **The Strategy Revealed / The Foolproof Strategy:** Widespread panic as military leaders acknowledge the "aliens'" strategy: dismantle city grids and re-enslave humanity via technocracy, or face total annihilation.
11. **The Long Siege / Atmospheric Anomalies:** Months of high-intensity warfare follow. "Alien Moon Base" fires plasma discharges—bright, silent flashes in the upper atmosphere—that devastate entire urban centers.
12. **The Encroaching Shadow:** The front line moves closer to Lem's city. The "Suburban Routine" becomes a practice in waiting for the end.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The discovery of a supposed "Alien Moon Base" through amateur signal leaks transforms from a fringe curiosity into a global phenomenon. Children play in the streets, mimicking the "Tripods" they see on the news, while a cultural divide grows between skeptics and doomers. Facing an existential threat, the world’s governments reluctantly began a slow process of unification, eventually merging into a single global military force—a 'do or die' response that the Core had spent decades engineering. In reality, the base is a terrestrial outpost seeded in 1971, and the "invasion" is a staged military coup designed to dismantle democratic grids and install a technocratic global order.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
These are my memories. I’m starting from the first thing I can remember and taking it through the five missions I was part of, up to the moment I send this transmission. I’ve tried to stick to the facts and keep my own opinions out of it. I’ve also included everything we preserved from the Before Time and the Core Technocracy, including the history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—what the Archive Transcripts call the Project Alpha activation. I want people to know the truth so these mistakes aren’t repeated.

The records show the conflict didn't start in my lifetime. It began in February 1971, when the Apollo 14 mission intentionally crashed a booster into the Moon. The impact wasn't just for seismic data; it was the delivery system for the first shards. The Moon’s Far Side had once belonged to a forgotten people—the Selenites—but the 1971 infection changed everything. Dr. Elowen Vane had spent the previous two decades developing Synodic technology in a terrestrial lab, and the Core used the Apollo mission to seed this toxin into the ancient lunar structures, allowing them to seize control of the base that would later be known as Cradle Prime.

I remember my childhood as a series of routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of the orphanage. I didn’t have a family, so my days were all about timetables. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a beginning.

The shift began slowly, with amateur radio leaks. They spoke of an "Alien Moon Base" on the far side, hidden from Earth’s view. We didn't know then that the Core was leaking the data themselves, baiting the trap. At first, it was just something for people on late-night forums to obsess over, parsing grainy telescope footage. But over the years, it became a global phenomenon that split the world. Half the people I knew thought it was some elaborate hoax or a deep-state plot to raise taxes. The other half just drew their curtains and waited for a signal that never seemed to come.

I remember watching the neighborhood children in the afternoons. They had already turned the news into a game, playing "Tripod" in the gutters and mimicking the heavy, loping gait of the entities they’d only seen in low-resolution leaks. They seemed detached, like they were watching a movie rather than the end of the world. Some of the older kids even started talking about "Rahu," a supposed whistleblower who was going to save us, but to the younger ones, it was just a new way to move their bodies.

Life stayed pretty normal for a long time, but the mood changed. Television sets were left on constantly, tuned to emergency frequencies just in case. Neighbors stopped talking about the weather and started watching the sky with a specific, quiet dread.

The first city fell three years after the leaks started. It was a major coastal hub, wiped out in a single afternoon by stadium-sized machines that looked like thin, elongated apes. The footage was everywhere—monoliths with arms so long they reached the ground, moving with a terrifying, heavy grace.

National borders didn't just vanish; they eroded over months of frantic negotiation and mounting casualties. The unification of the world's militaries wasn't a moment of brotherhood—it was a reluctant, 'do or die' necessity. One by one, generals who had been enemies for decades surrendered their autonomy to a central command, realizing it was the only way to stand a chance against the monoliths.

Panic hit the highest levels of command when the "aliens" revealed their strategy. The ultimatum was broadcast on every channel: humanity could allow the monoliths to dismantle the power grids and accept a new technocratic order, or face total destruction. There was no middle ground, and no defense against the plasma that could turn a capital city into a lake of glass in seconds.

In the months that followed, the moon began to fire back. Plasma discharges—silent, blinding flashes in the upper atmosphere—would be followed by the news that another city had been destroyed. My neighborhood became a practice in waiting. We followed the news like it was the only thing that mattered, watching the front line crawl across the map toward us. The news had stopped being neutral.

History isn't just a record of the past; it's a living shadow. My name is Lem, and I am a witness to the final days of the world I called home. I was born into a silence that felt like peace, never realizing that the sky above was gathering its strength for a storm that would unmake us all. This is the first transmission—the record of a journey into the heart of a cosmic mystery.

My early years were defined by the steady, rhythmic pulse of the city. I lived in an orphanage of gray stone and sun-drenched gardens, where time was measured in laughter and lessons. We felt safe. We felt permanent. We watched the news as the first anomalies appeared—signal leaks from the Moon that whispered of a hidden history. The world called them 'alien,' and we looked to the stars with a mix of wonder and dread. 

The 'Alien Moon Base' became a global fixation. On the streets, children turned the rumors into legends. They played 'Tripod' beneath the massive oaks, their bodies mimicking the heavy, powerful gait of the phantoms they’d seen on grainy satellite feeds. They didn't see monsters; they saw giants. And we, the adults-to-be, sat on our porches and watched the radio, waiting for the sky to speak.

The first city didn't just fall; it was transformed. A coastal jewel was eclipsed by the arrival of the Monoliths—stadium-sized shadows that walked with a terrifying, rhythmic grace. They were like mountains that had decided to migrate. We called it "The Great Fry," as the grid collapsed and the lights of civilization winked out one by one.

In the face of the impossible, humanity did something rare: we unified. National borders dissolved as the world’s militaries merged into a single, global force. It was a desperate, heroic effort—a 'do or die' response to an ultimatum that arrived like a thunderclap. The machines weren't here to negotiate; they were here to harvest. Surrender our grids, or watch the atmosphere ignite.

By the time the front line reached my suburb, the news was a countdown to a new era. Every flash in the midnight sky was a beacon. We watched the stars, not with fear, but with a growing realization that our place in the universe was about to change forever. We weren't being invaded. We were being awakened.
