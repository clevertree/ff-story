# Chapter 37: Vision

**Setting:** Cradle Zero (Deep Sanitization Lab); Remote View (White Forest)
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Waking up in Cradle Zero after the destruction of his previous mission, Lem is immediately paralyzed and placed into stasis by a silent Anton Drexler. While his body is locked away, Lem's consciousness remains active, eventually discovering a way to remote view the aftermath in the North. Through a link established by shards of his previous frame left inside an Electronic Snake, he witnesses the horrific "Sanitization" of the White Forest by a staged heat ray array. He watches the **Voidsmen**'s guardians attempt a final charge before the link is permanently severed by the forest's incineration.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Political Erasure:** Reflection on the political landscape—the Core has officially declared the Northern "Void" as a bio-hazard zone, using the destruction of the sanctuary as a pretext for total regional consolidation.
2. **The Broken Cycle:** Lem reincarnates in Cradle Zero. Anton Drexler is the only one in the room, standing where Cassia usually sits. He does not speak. He simply watches a screen showing the "Sanitization" of the White Forest in the **Silver Bight**. The room smells of ozonated amniotic fluid and filtered air.
3. **Internal Logistics:** Description of the **Amniotic Cycle**—the recycled fluid that re-hydrates the organic components of the Vessel after the flash-printing process.
4. **Technical Exposition:** Explanation of the **Neural-Lock**—a device at the base of the skull that interrupts the motor cortex signals, effectively turning the body into a mannequin while leaving the mind aware.
5. **The Stasis Protocol:** Before the fluid fully drains, Anton enters a command. The neural-lock triggers, paralyzing Lem. The capsule is sealed, and Lem is plunged into a non-responsive stasis.
6. **Passage of Time:** Time passes with agonizing slowness. Three weeks of physical time compress into what feels like centuries of mental isolation within the stasis unit.
7. **The Dreamscape Drift:** Within the paralysis, Lem’s consciousness remains active. He loses his reckoning of the world outside until a familiar resonance—the "Wood-element" persistence—awakens his spirit within the cage.
8. **Religious Reflection:** Reflection on "The Burning of the Root"—a philosophical concept from the **Wuxan Pentad** about the end of the world being preceded by the death of the silence.
9. **The Flame in the Tunnel:** He manifests in his inner dreamscape. He sees the golden flame at the end of a long, dark tunnel. He pursues it, pushing through the digital fog of the stasis.
10. **The Burning Shore:** The tunnel opens into a vision of the White Forest. But it’s not the sanctuary he left. It is a hellscape of orange and blue flames. The crystal trees are melting into glass.
11. **Sensory Impact:** The sensory impact of the vision: the "soundless fire" of the scalar beams, the smell of vaporized copper, and the blinding white-blue light of the thermal array.
12. **The Invisible Scythe:** He sees the cause: an array of **Scalar Thermal Devices** staged outside the forest boundaries. These rays cut deep into the forest like a blade through silk, incinerating the **Voidsmen** who called it home. He sees Sarah, the technician, running through the flames before she is erased by a beam.
13. **The Shard's Perspective:** He sees three giant Electric Snakes—the guardians of the forest—writhing in pain. They attempt to fight back but cannot get close to the rays. Lem realizes he is seeing this through the "shards"—remnants of his previous frame that were integrated into the snake's chassis when it consumed him.
14. **Core Propaganda:** A snippet of Core propaganda plays in the background of his mind: *"Peace is Parallel. Unity is Unbreakable. The North is Reclaimed."*
15. **The Final Incineration:** The snake that ate him is caught in the direct path of the beam. As the creature is vaporized, the remote link shatters. Lem is thrown back into the darkness of his stasis pod.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The fluid in the pod was warm, but the room itself felt like a freezer. Cassia Vane, the woman who usually helped me wake up, wasn't there. Only Anton Drexler stood over the tank. He was cold and stiff as a statue, his eyes fixed on a holographic display of the Northern sky where a world was being turned to ash. He didn't offer a "welcome back" or a "mission success." He just typed a single command into his interface.

*LOCK.*

A sharp, electric sting hit the base of my skull. It was a neural-lock, and instantly, my brand-new arms and legs went dead. I was a prisoner in a body that hadn't even finished drying yet. I felt a surge of panic, a silent scream trapped in a throat that wouldn't move. The capsule hissed as it sealed shut, and I was plunged into a total, heavy darkness. 

In stasis, time doesn't move forward; it circles around you. I felt my spirit—the "Wood-element" that the Core couldn't quite contain—drifting through the dark. Weeks passed in a blur of cold dreams. Then, I saw it: the flame. It was a small, golden flicker at the end of a long, dark tunnel in my mind. 

I ran toward it. When I reached the light, I wasn't in the lab anymore. I was back in the White Forest, but it was a nightmare. The beautiful crystal trees were melting into rivers of liquid glass under a sky of choked orange smoke. I saw the "invisible scythes"—high-intensity thermal devices staged just outside the forest perimeter. They cut through the silence like a hot knife through wax, setting the sanctuary on fire without a single sound, wiping out the **Voidsmen**'s last refuge. I saw Sarah, the technician I had talked to just hours ago, her outline disappearing into a wall of white heat.

I wasn't just watching; I was connected. I could see through the eyes of the Electronic Snake—the giant guardian that had eaten me in my last life. My previous body’s shards were still inside its metal frame, acting like a remote camera. I felt the snake’s copper scales vibrating with terror as its brothers were vaporized by the invisible beams.

A voice like a radio broadcast hummed in my head: *Peace is Parallel. Unity is Unbreakable.* It was Core propaganda, playing over the destruction like a lullaby for a dying world.

The snake made one final, desperate charge toward the invisible rays, eyes fixed on the silver-clad technicians operating the beams. Then, the world turned into a blinding wall of white heat. The link snapped. I was pulled back into the dark of the stasis pod where the high-pitched hum of the spinning field erased the memory of the light. The White Forest was gone.

My return to the world was a breathless, ghastly moment. Only ninety-seven seconds had passed since my light was extinguished in the North, yet here I was—a Vessel reborn in a body of leaden silver. But there was no warmth in this resurrection. The air in the lab was sharp with the smell of ozonated amniotic fluid. Cassia Vane was nowhere to be seen. In her place stood Anton Drexler, a cold architect of ruin whose silence was as heavy as a gravestone. He did not look at me; his eyes were fixed on a display of the northern sky, where the realm of the **Voidsmen** was being turned to ash. 

The political landscape had been reorganized in a single morning. The "Void" was officially a bio-hazard zone, and I was the trigger that had authorized its deletion.

Anton did not speak. He simply activated the **Neural-Lock**—a constraint device at the base of my skull that intercepted my motor cortex. My connection was severed from my limbs in a heartbeat, leaving me a mannequin in my own skin. The capsule slid into the floor, the amniotic cycle finishing its re-hydration in the dark.

Time lost its meaning. In the frozen dark of my stasis, my consciousness refused to sleep. The roots of my Wood-element spirit probed the boundaries of my shell, searching for a way out. I found myself in a long, dark tunnel once more, following the golden resonance that called to me from the end of the void. This was the "Burning of the Root"—the final prophecy of a world that refused to be numbered.

When I reached the light, I was back in the White Forest, but the sanctuary had become a supercritical thermal zone. The beautiful trees were melting into rivers of glass under a sky of choked orange smoke. The machine had deployed its **Scalar Thermal Devices**—arrays of high-intensity energy beams staged outside the forest boundaries. They carved through the silence like a blade through silk, ignoring the forest’s ancient defenses and turning the **Voidsmen**'s domain into a pyre. I saw Sarah and the other technicians burned into shadows on the glass, their final moments processed as mere data points.

I was not merely a witness; I was bound to the tragedy. I could see the carnage through the eyes of a leviathan. The Electronic Snake that had consumed my previous form was still fighting, my own internal shards acting as a bridge between my spirit and its agony. I saw two other guardians writhing as their copper scales turned to white-hot liquid under the invisible scythe.

In the background of the static, the Hive's broadcast pulse beat like a dead heart: *Peace is Parallel. Unity is Unbreakable. The North is Reclaimed.*

The host snake reared its head one last time, a scream of static and vaporized metal directed at the silver-clad humans who stood in the shadows of the beams. Then, a direct hit from the thermal array vaporized its core. The link was incinerated, and I was thrown back into the stasis pod, where the high-velocity vibration of the field became the only remaining signal. I was a hero in a cage, watching the world I was supposed to save turn into a desert of glass.
