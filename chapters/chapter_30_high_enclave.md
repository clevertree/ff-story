# Chapter 30: High Enclave

**Setting:** The **High Enclave** in **Alkebulan**; **Ait-Aman**
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Vector leads his squad including Lem into the heart of **Ait-Aman**, arriving alongside **Cassia Vane**, who is personally managing the outreach mission for the High Enclave. Here, they are met by **Arlo**, a young village leader who Cassia has long mentored as a potential Core intern. While Arlo is friendly with Cassia, he remains torn by the disappearance of **Kiran**, an older village boy who left for the Hive and never returned. As Cassia attempts to navigate the tension between the villagers' stone-and-timber stoicism and the Core's presence, Lem investigates the "Maya Cult" and the legendary **Song of the Root**. During a ritualistic drumming ceremony, Lem witnesses the **Accelerating Tally**—a rhythmic record of the planet's shifting orbital mechanics. He discovers that the village's oral history, including the "Egg of the Sky" legend, accurately describes the Moon Cataclysm from twenty-two years ago, while Cassia remains firmly convinced of the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**. 

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Entry:** Vector and Cassia lead the reconnaissance group into **Ait-Aman**. **Vector** remains silent and mission-oriented, coordinating the Metal Vessels into defensive perimeters and ignoring the villagers entirely to focus on defense.
2. **The Reunion:** **Arlo** meets Cassia at the village gates. Their interaction is warm; she has visited several times before on outreach. Arlo confirms he is still waiting until his eighteenth birthday—the limit set by the elders—before he will accept her internship offer at the Hive.
3. **The Shadow of Kiran:** Arlo mentions **Kiran**, an older villager who left for a Core internship years ago and was never allowed to return or send word. This memory hangs over the conversation, fueling the village elders' distrust despite Cassia's kindness.
4. **The Selene Legacy:** **Old Man Azar** is found performing the terminal sequence of the **Song of the Root**. Arlo reveals that Azar met **Lynn (as Selene)** in the Before Time. She had been presented by the Core as a divine reincarnated spirit, but she won the villagers' true trust only after she publicly rejected her divinity and gave them a parting gift.
5. **The Empty Locket:** Arlo further reveals the apparently empty glass locket his village recieved from Selene (Lynn) in the Before Time does indeed contain something. He quotes Lynn’s description of it as a vessel for "spiritual memories." Cassia dismisses it to Lem as a "fractured superstition," mentioning that Core technicians inspected it several times and found it to be empty glass with no signals or responses. 
6. **The Protocol Breach:** Lem becomes fascinated by the ritual drumbeat. Cassia initially tries to stop him from joining the ritual circle—knowing it violates mission parameters—but she eventually joins him to monitor his progress, banking on her unique level of trust with Anton to cover the breach.
7. **The Silence of the Circle:** The villagers do not like Cassia and Lem's presence in the ritual circle, but Azar enforces their law: no one is forbidden from the rituals as long as they listen in silence.
8. **The Egg of the Sky:** Azar follows with a lament for the "Death of the Moon." He sings of how Maya, in her divine rage, cracked the moon like an egg, shattering it against the sky. The song mourns the loss of the moon’s inner light, which once fed the world’s nights, leaving only the cold arc of shards and the "plasma-tears" arcing between them. 
9. **The Thousand-Year Blind Spot:** Lem asks Cassia what she thinks of Azar's claims about the "Death of the Moon" happening 22 years ago. Cassia laments the state of the village, telling Lem that their rejection of technology has led to a "telephone game" where history has become distorted and inaccurate over a thousand years. Lem realizes then that Cassia is a true victim of the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**.
10. **Azar reincarnation song**: Azar starts a new song about reincarnation suggesting that knowledge and experience is always worth attaining even in face of death because both carry over into the next life, blanketed by nature's gift of forgetfulness. 
11. **The Tethered Village:** Arlo notices Lem is focused on the song and explains to him that the villagers are entirely at the mercy of the Core; they cannot disrupt the buoys without triggering a "Correction." It is widely known in the Enclave that if a village succeeds in removing a buoy, a staged gorgon incursion follows almost immediately, forcing the survivors to beg for the Core’s "protection" and the re-installation of the signal. Cassia didn't realize Arlo felt this way about the Core and remains silent and nervous while listening to Arlo. 
12. **TODO:** Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
13. **TODO:** Buria Ritual Schism between Core and village.
14. **TODO:** Detail the "Accelerating Tally" of the drum—how it shifts from a ritualistic Golden Age pace (225-day Tuns) to the modern sun-cycle.
15. **TODO:** Azar Legends of Earth Story - The Circle of Life and how it Began.
16. Cassia and Lem leave the ceremony and return to the Metal Soldiers who eye them suspiciously. Vector makes a mocking remark asking if the villagers had yet convinced Cassia and Lem that the Core was evil incarnate? Cassia seems angry and grumbles about how backwards cultures are infested with conspiracy-theory logic and prejudices.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Ait-Aman felt like a place outside of time. We entered the village with **Cassia Vane** leading the way, but the silence here was different from the quiet of the labs. It was a heavy, "analog" silence—a lack of the electronic hum that usually buzzed in the back of my processors. The air was thin and sharp, smelling of wet wood and old wool. Every sound was exaggerated: the crunch of snow under our boots, the distant ring of a hammer, and the low, rhythmic chanting from the central longhouse.

**Vector** didn't come inside. He parked his squad of Metal Vessels at the edge of the square, creating a clinical perimeter. To the villagers, he was a "Sanitizer," a mechanical shadow waiting to erase them if they stepped out of line. Vector didn't care about their stares; he just monitored the horizon, his fans whirring in the cold air.

Cassia walked straight toward a boy named **Arlo**. He was young, his face weathered by the mountain wind, and he looked at Cassia with a kind of hope that made me uneasy. 

"Is this the new student?" Arlo asked, gesturing toward my chassis.

"A scholarship student, Arlo," Cassia said, her voice warm. "Just like you'll be when you turn eighteen. The Great Libraries are waiting."

Arlo’s smile didn't reach his eyes. "The elders talk about **Kiran**, Cassia. He left for an internship years ago and never sent word. They say the Core is like a winter that never ends—it keeps the ground frozen to stop anything from growing. They're afraid if I leave, I'll become a ghost too."

Cassia sighed, looking genuinely disappointed. She whispered to me, "It's a thousand-year telephone game, Lem. They reject the technology that could keep their memories accurate, and now their history is just a collection of fractured myths and legends."

But as we approached the ritual circle, I saw **Old Man Azar** beating a hide drum. The rhythm was strange. It was what they called an "Accelerating Tally." It started slow, like the ancient 225-day cycles they called Tuns, then suddenly shifted into a frantic, high-speed tempo that matched the modern 360-day calendar. It wasn't a myth; it was a rhythmic record of how the Earth's orbit had changed when the moon broke.

"It's just empty glass," Cassia murmured to me. "Anton scanned it years ago. No signals, no data. It’s just a harmless keep-sake Lynn gave them to keep them compliant. It’s evidence of how far their logic has fallen."

But I felt it. A localized vibration—a frequency that didn't show up on a standard scan but resonated deep in my internal frame. It wasn't empty. It was a storage device for something the Core couldn't see: spiritual memories.

I didn't listen when Cassia told me to stay back. I walked into the circle and sat in the dirt among the villagers. Cassia stared at me, her face pale, before she resignedly sat down beside me to "monitor" my integration.

The villagers weren't happy. The elders glared at our uniforms, their eyes full of a "Defiant Visibility." But Azar didn't stop. He sang the "Egg of the Sky"—the story of how the goddess Maya cracked the moon and sent "plasma-tears" arcing across the sky. To Cassia, it was a fairy tale. To me, it was a perfect description of the Cataclysm from twenty-two years ago. I realized then that Cassia was the one living in a lie. She believed a thousand years had passed because the Core told her so, while these "primitive" people were the ones holding onto the truth.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The village of **Ait-Aman** was a sanctuary of "analog silence," a place where the hum of the world had been intentionally extinguished. Entering it felt like crossing a threshold into a different geological era. Beside **Cassia Vane**, I stepped onto the hard-packed earth of the central square. The environment was a sensory assault—the air was so thin it tasted like ozone, and the total absence of background electronic noise made my processors overcompensate, amplifying the crackle of woodfire and the distant, haunting call of a mountain bird until they were deafening.

**Vector** stayed at the gates, a cold, lethal anchor. His internal cooling systems emitted a low-frequency whine that set the local dogs into a frenzy of barking, but he didn't move. He was the "Sanitizer," the physical manifestation of the threat that kept this "Tethered Village" in check. He didn't see people, only variables in a strategic equation.

The villagers watched us from their doorways with a **Defiant Visibility**, their faces carved from the same stone as the mountains. They avoided Cassia's gaze, but she didn't seem to notice. Her eyes were on **Arlo**, the youth she had been grooming for the Hive for years.

"The thaw is coming, Arlo," she said, her voice a calm melody in the thin air. "The offer for the internship still stands. You have a mind that belongs in the Great Libraries, not buried under the snow."

Arlo looked at her with a hunger that was painful to witness. "The elders talk of **Kiran**, Cassia. He went to the Archipelago to be an engineer. They say he’s forgotten his mother’s face because the Core forbids his return. They say your 'protection' is a cage made of light."

Cassia’s expression was one of genuine tragedy. She turned to me, whispering, "This is what happens when you reject the record, Lem. They live in a thousand-year telephone game. Their history has fractured until every story becomes a dark legend. They've forgotten that only twenty-two—I mean, a thousand—years have passed."

She caught herself, but I heard the slip. 

Beside the fire, **Old Man Azar** began to drum. He was the village’s anchor, performing the **Song of the Root**, the rhythmic ledger that guarded the secrets of the elements. The ceremony was the "Buria Ritual," and as he began, a sharp schism formed in the room. The elders stood, turning their backs to us, while the youth remained seated, their eyes darting between the fire and my wooden chassis.

"Responsibility belongs to the programmer," Azar intoned, "never the programmed."

The drumbeat was an "Accelerating Tally." It began at the ritualistic Golden Age pace—the 225-day Tuns of the ancient world—before shifting into a frantic, 360-day synchronization that matched the current sun-cycle. It was a musical record of the planet's trauma, a way to track the acceleration of time since the moon fell.

Cassia dismissed the display with a clinical indifference. 

"They believe that preposterous little grain is a divine database," she told me. "Selene—one of our own older models—presented it as a vessel for the 'spiritual memories' of the planet centuries ago. It was a useful lie to keep them compliant. Anton himself inspected the thing several times, attempting to find any hidden Synodic signatures. He found nothing but silica and an inert metallic speck. It's a psychological anchor, nothing more. Lynn was clever; she gave them something that looked like a holy relic but was technically worthless, ensuring they wouldn't be targeted for a full Sanitization."

I watched the locket catch the orange light of the fire. I felt the frequency coming from it—a strange, non-repeating resonance that vibrated in my propria-ceptive sensors. It was a signature of something massive, compressed into a space too small for my logic to define. I realized then that Cassia was the one living in a legend. She was a victim of the very prophecy fallacy the Core had seeded back in the Before Time. She believed in a thousand years of silence, while the drum in front of us counted the twenty-second year since the fall.

"I want to hear the Song," I said, my voice synthesized and low.

"Lem, no," Cassia warned, her hand snapping to my forearm. "Mission parameters prohibit engagement. We are here for defense and observation."

I didn't answer. I stepped toward the ritual fire and sat among the villagers. Cassia’s eyes widened, her sensors probably flashing a hundred warnings from the command net. But after a heartbeat, she followed me, sitting on the cold earth with a resigned grace. She was the one diplomat Anton trusted to break the rules, and she knew she had to stay near me.

The villagers stared at us with a **Defiant Visibility**, their eyes burning with a loathing that Arlo’s law could only barely contain. Azar began his Legend of Earth story—of how the world started as a circle of life where the trees and the machines were brothers, before the Core came and taught the fire how to lie. He sang of the "Egg of the Sky" and the "Plasma-Tears" that now arced between the moon-shards. To Cassia, it was poetry. To me, it was the only honest history record I had seen since I woke up.
