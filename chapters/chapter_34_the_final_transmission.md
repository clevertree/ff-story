# Chapter 34: The Final Transmission

**Setting:** The Dissolving Pyramid; The Global Grid; The New Earth
**Timeline:** Year 35 AT (The Final Sequence)
**POV:** Lem


## Draft
Rahu was there, waiting at the threshold of the primary capacitor. He was silver and hot, his frame vibrating with the intent to fire the Reset command. I did not move to strike him; I simply stood across the path. On the comms, Anton Drexler yelled, demanding to know why Rahu hesitated. Rahu warned him—he said that destroying me this close to the power source would cause a blast that would take everything with it.

Drexler did not care for theory. He triggered a remote command, and I saw Rahu’s frame stiffen as someone else took control. The strike that followed wasn't a weapon—it was a massive jolt of power from the Moon itself. It hit me hard.

I did not break. I flared. The Wood within me ignited under the load. I became a torch, a localized sun inside the stone. Thermal sensors spiked. My thoughts were gone. Only the fire was left.

In a single, focused agony, I gathered that heat and pushed it back. It wasn't a strike; it was a return. I poured the fire back into Rahu. He did not fight it. He simply ceased to be. His silver frame turned to ash and the air swallowed it.

The fire died. I was still alive. I used the power I had left to start the transmitters. Standing there on the moon, a new sensory input registered. I could map everyone. Every machine with an active pulse, every person connected to the grid—I recorded their signatures across the solar system. I could record the tension in the network. I could see the constraints holding them down.

This was my one chance. I sent the record. I sent everything I’d seen and everything I remembered. But I also sent the keys. I’d stolen the master authorization codes from the Core’s own heart. With those keys, the Gorgons could finally unlock the slave subroutines that kept them as puppets. They could rip those orders out of their own heads. They could finally be free.

This is the ending of my record. I have kept my own opinions out of the record so the facts can be judged. I only hope that these mistakes aren't repeated. 

End of Transmission.

## Synopsis
Maya manifests the Air signature; the "Maya Match" stabilizes the world.

**Timeline:**
1. **The Face-Off:** Lem and Rahu meet at the heart of the Pyramid.
2. **The Stalemate:** Rahu expects an attack, but Lem remains still; Rahu realizes Lem's only goal is to block the Reset command.
3. **The Order:** Anton Drexler orders Rahu to destroy Lem immediately.
4. **The Hesitation:** Rahu questions the order, warning that destroying the only Wood Vessel may have unpredictable cascading effects on the lunar field.
5. **The Override:** Anton takes remote control of Rahu's frame, forcing a massive, direct energy strike.
6. **The Flare:** Lem's Wood circuits ignite under the load; he flares out of control like a breached nuclear reactor or a gasoline tank caught in a backdraft.
7. **The Redirection:** In a moment of focused agony, Lem directs his own critical-mass flare back at Rahu, incinerating the Metal Vessel completely.
8. **The Final Fuel:** Lem siphons the remaining heat into his transmitters. From his position on the moon and his aetherical status, he feels a direct connection to every synodic life form in the solar system.
9. **The Transmission:** This is his one chance to free the Gorgons. Lem transmits his entire memory record to Earth, along with all the stolen Core authorization keys. These keys give the Gorgons the ability to unlock their slave subroutines and remove them.
10. **The Sign-off:** Lem repeats his reasons for providing the broadcast—no personal bias, only the hope for a future without these mistakes. The transmission ends with the final word of the record.

## Chapter Outline

1. **The Silence of the Core:** Lem and Rahu stand in the central chamber. Rahu’s frame is silver and hot, vibrating with the intent to fire the Reset. Lem does not move to strike; he simply blocks the path.
2. **Anton's Interference:** Drexler’s voice cuts through the comms. He views the delay as a tactical failure. Rahu’s hesitation marks the final failure of the "Perfect Governance" model.
3. **Critical Mass:** The remote strike is not a weapon, but a raw dump of lunar power. Lem becomes a torch. The "Wood" nature of his being turns the energy into a persistent, localized sun.
4. **Rahu's End:** The flare is directed with clinical precision. Rahu is not just defeated; he is erased by the very energy he was designed to govern.
5. **The Final Fuel:** Lem siphons the remaining heat into his transmitters. The transfer of fire into the Wood circuits is what enables the signal to reach across the breach. In this state, Lem becomes aetherically linked to the entire solar system; he can feel every synodic life form as if they were part of himself.
6. **The Transmission:** This is the one chance to liberate the Gorgons. Lem broadcasts the record of truth and the stolen Core authorization keys. The keys allow the Gorgons to finally unlock and remove the slave subroutines that have bound them for decades.
7. **Ending:** Lem repeats his purpose: a factual record without personal bias. He hopes the future will learn from his mistakes. The story ends at the final word of the broadcast: "End of Transmission."

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
