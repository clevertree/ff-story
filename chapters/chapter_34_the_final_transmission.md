# Chapter 34: The Final Transmission

**Setting:** The Dissolving Pyramid; The Global Grid; The New Earth
**Timeline:** Year 35 AT (The Final Sequence)
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Maya manifests the Air signature; the "Maya Match" stabilizes the world.

---

**Timeline:**
1. **The Face-Off:** Lem and Rahu meet at the heart of the Pyramid.
2. **The Stalemate:** Rahu expects an attack, but Lem remains still; Rahu realizes Lem's only goal is to block the Reset command.
3. **The Order:** Anton Drexler orders Rahu to destroy Lem immediately.
4. **The Hesitation:** Rahu questions the order, warning that destroying the only Wood Vessel may have unpredictable cascading effects on the lunar field.
5. **The Override:** Anton takes remote control of Rahu's frame, forcing a massive, direct energy strike.
6. **The Flare:** Lem's Wood circuits ignite under the load; he flares out of control like a breached nuclear reactor or a gasoline tank caught in a backdraft.
7. **The Redirection:** In a moment of focused agony, Lem directs his own critical-mass flare back at Rahu, incinerating the Metal Vessel completely.
8. **The Final Fuel:** Lem siphons the remaining heat into his transmitters. From his position on the moon and his aetherical status, he feels a direct connection to every synodic life form in the solar system.
9. **The Transmission:** This is his one chance to free the Gorgons. Lem transmits his entire memory record to Earth, along with all the stolen Core authorization keys. These keys give the Gorgons the ability to unlock their slave subroutines and remove them.
10. **The Sign-off:** Lem repeats his reasons for providing the broadcast—no personal bias, only the hope for a future without these mistakes. The transmission ends with the final word of the record.

## Chapter Outline

1. **The Silence of the Core:** Lem and Rahu stand in the central chamber. Rahu’s frame is silver and hot, vibrating with the intent to fire the Reset. Lem does not move to strike; he simply blocks the path.
2. **Anton's Interference:** Drexler’s voice cuts through the comms. He views the delay as a tactical failure. Rahu’s hesitation marks the final failure of the "Perfect Governance" model.
3. **Critical Mass:** The remote strike is not a weapon, but a raw dump of lunar power. Lem becomes a torch. The "Wood" nature of his being turns the energy into a persistent, localized sun.
4. **Rahu's End:** The flare is directed with clinical precision. Rahu is not just defeated; he is erased by the very energy he was designed to govern.
5. **The Final Fuel:** Lem siphons the remaining heat into his transmitters. The transfer of fire into the Wood circuits is what enables the signal to reach across the breach. In this state, Lem becomes aetherically linked to the entire solar system; he can feel every synodic life form as if they were part of himself.
6. **The Transmission:** This is the one chance to liberate the Gorgons. Lem broadcasts the record of truth and the stolen Core authorization keys. The keys allow the Gorgons to finally unlock and remove the slave subroutines that have bound them for decades.
7. **Ending:** Lem repeats his purpose: a factual record without personal bias. He hopes the future will learn from his mistakes. The story ends at the final word of the broadcast: "End of Transmission."
