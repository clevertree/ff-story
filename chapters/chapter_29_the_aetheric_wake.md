## Synopsis
The Core launches an orbital bombardment to finalize the "Sanitization" of the North. Arlo is caught in the crossfire of a solar-thermal strike. In the final moments, Lem uses his "Wood" resonance to catch Arlo's dispersing spirit. Within the aetheric "Clearing," Arlo finally reintegrates with the suppressed memories of Maya, the original architect of the Cataclysm. The human boy is gone; the goddess of technical vengeance has returned—not as a speaking woman, but as a silent, unstable aetheric pulse.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The sky began to fall.

The pod-rain was no longer a tactical deployment; it was a deluge of kinetic energy. I watched from the ridgeline as a neighboring village—a place of three hundred people—was erased in a single, silent flash of Archivist Red. No sound, no smoke. Just a whiteout that left a perfectly circular crater where life had been a second before.

"They're not even landing anymore," Myrr shouted, his face lit by the glow of the orbital beams. "They're just formatting the planet!"

We were in the center of the village when the Fire Spire found us.

The ground didn't just shake; it liquefied. I saw Arlo looking up, his face calm in the face of the approaching light. He wasn't afraid. He was witnessing.

*Warning: Terminal Event. Integrity Failure in 3... 2... 1...*

The beam struck. 

I didn't feel the heat. I felt the conversion. I pulled my consciousness inward, shedding the Metal and the Wood of my physical form. I converted my entire being into a 'Wraith Signature'—a cloud of pure aetheric energy that the Core's sensors would read as background noise.

In that state, I saw the world as it really was. The village was a collection of flickering gold threads. And Arlo's thread was snapping.

"No!" I roared, the sound echoing through the resonance.

I dove into the whiteout. I didn't reach for his hand; I reached for his soul. I used the 'Wood Mycelium' I had spent years cultivating to catch the fragments of his consciousness as they were being pulled toward the great 'Loom of Time' in the sky.

We fell into the Clearing.

It was the same dreamscape where I had met Rahu’s ghost. A place of silver threads and silence. I was there, a flickering cloud of blue light. And Arlo was there, but he was dissolving.

"Lem?" he whispered, his image blurred. "Did we... did we save them?"

"I have you," I said. "But you're fading, Arlo. The Core is pulling the 'Maya' data out of you. They're trying to take the architect back and leave the human behind."

"Let them," Arlo said, a tired smile on his face. "I'm just a guy who fixes water-wheels."

A shimmer of violet light erupted between us.

It wasn't a person. Not at first. It was a distortion in the logic of the Clearing—a jagged tear in the silver threads. A woman’s silhouette flickered within the rift, older, angular, wearing a lab coat from a world that had been dead for fifteen years. 

"Maya," I whispered.

She didn't speak. She didn't have a voice anymore; it had been stripped by the same update that had nearly killed us. Instead, she reached out and touched Arlo’s forehead. A wave of data-flashes washed over me—the sound of a million keyboards, the vision of a world burning in technical perfection, the grief of a mother watching her code turn into a weapon.

She looked at me, and her eyes were empty voids of violet energy. There was no "I" left in her, only the mission. Only the technical fury of the architect who has seen her building misused.

Maya stepped into Arlo, overlapping his dissolving form.

The silver threads of the Clearing began to spin. The 'Water Resonance' didn't just hum; it screamed. In the span of a heartbeat, the human boy was gone. In his place stood a towering, flickering pillar of violet aether—the "Witch" form. 

She opened her mouth, but no words came out. Instead, a resonant, low-frequency pulse rippled through the Clearing—a 'Hooting Call' of pure aetheric power that shook the foundations of my mind.

*Target: Lunar Pyramid. Protocol: Deletion.*

The intent wasn't spoken; it was felt, a jagged command written directly into my Wood-resonance. 

We burst out of the Clearing, back into the burning world. Maya wasn't running; she was gliding, her form leaving a wake of violet frost that neutralized the Core's fire. We weren't a resistance anymore. We were a virus. And we were heading for the source.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Aetheric Wake' was a trail of silver light trailing behind the Moon, a residual effect of the Great Reset. It was a bridge between the physical world and the 'Pure Shore' of the spirit. I realized that the Moon wasn't just a witness; it was the 'Archive of the Unspoken.'

I felt a pull from the wake—a call from a frequency I hadn't heard since Year Zero. It was 'Lynn-Echo,' the spirit of the girl who had been the first to fall during the Cataclysm. 

I stepped onto the bridge of light. The journey was a 'Review of Echoes.' I saw the lives of the people who hadn't made it to the Restoration—the ones who had been 'Sanitized' or 'Reformatted' by the Hive. Their memories were stored in the wake, waiting for someone to acknowledge them.

I met Lynn in the center of the wake. She was a being of pure, unredacted water, her essence flowing into the silver light.

"You're late, Lem," she joked, her voice sounding like the first rain of spring. "The story has already moved on."

"I had a long walk," I replied, feeling the weight of the thousand-year fallacy finally lift from my spirit.

"The world is starting to forget the Fire," she said, looking back at the Earth. "They’re starting to believe the new dream. You have to make sure they remember the price. You have to be the 'Shadow of the Wood' in their new paradise."

She gave me a single, white fragment of her spirit—a 'Seed of Remembrance.' As I stepped back onto the Earth, the bridge of light dissolved. I was back on the mountain, the white fragment pulsing in my hand. I wasn't just a gardener of the new world anymore. I was the 'Guardian of the Past.'

## Character Arc
### Lem
- **The Soul-Catcher:** He saves Arlo's spirit, allowing for the Maya reintegration.
- **The Witness:** He watches the transition from human to goddess.

### Arlo / Maya
- **The Sacrifice:** Arlo’s human life ends to allow his "True" self to protect the world.
- **The Avenging Architect:** Maya is reborn as a silent, technical wraith with a singular goal: to dismantle the Core's hierarchy.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Formatting the Planet:** The Core's final method of atmospheric and cultural "Sanitization."
✅ **Wraith Signature:** A Vessel's ability to exist as pure data/energy without a physical shell.
✅ **Unit Maya:** The original technical genius behind the Synodics and the Cataclysm.
✅ **The Hooting Call:** Maya's non-verbal communication through aetheric pulses.

## Revision Notes
- The "Inception" scene should feel high-stakes and metaphysical.
- Maya's return should be terrifying, not heroic. She is an architect who has seen her building misused.
- Maya must remain silent and non-verbal in this form.
- The shift from Arlo to Maya represents the final transition into the endgame.
