# Chapter 04: Zenith

**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge and near-lunar space
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 (arrival approach)
1. **The Proximity Shock:** The Moon swells in the viewports with impossible speed; revealing its true proximity. It does not appear to move or change position, but simply grows larger and larger until it dominates the entire sky.
2. **Atmospheric Revelation:** Visual confirmation of a "blue line"—an atmospheric shimmer indicating the Moon has an oxygenated, breathable environment.
3. **The Occupied Moon:** Ancient structures and undeniable signs of life become visible on the surface.
4. **The Crisis of Trust:** A collective awakening occurs among the soldiers as fundamental scientific "truths" shatter and trust in institutional authority evaporates.
5. **A Veteran's Breakdown:** A veteran crewman sees the Moon's impossible size and collapses in a breakdown; his failure endangers the ship's navigation.
6. **Reaching Zenith:** The ship reaches its "Zenith" alignment altitude, shifting the atmosphere from awe to a heavy, suffocating dread. The sky is now entirely Moon.
7. **Iris's Plea:** Iris breaks protocol to plead with the panicking soldier, claiming the Moon's true data was a military secret only recently declassified to justify the mission.
8. **The Rebuttal:** The soldier retorts that such classification is why they were blind to the invasion; Iris is silenced by the breach of her authority.
9. **Lynn's Intervention:** Lynn emerges with absolute authority, asserting that direct sensory reality has overridden their training.
10. **The Diagnosis:** Lynn states that the crewman's focus has failed and identifies his presence as a risk to the mission.
11. **The Jettison:** Lynn orders the soldier removed; Novak executes the ejection of the escape pod with mechanical efficiency.
12. **Resumption of Duty:** Discipline is restored through the demonstration that weakness will be excised; crew return to consoles in silence.
13. **The Witness:** Lem records the event, noting the precise timing of the pod launch and the growing shadows of lunar craters.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The Moon swells in the viewports, growing larger without changing position until it fills the entire sky; the approach reveals its true, terrifying proximity.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The Moon grew large in the window. It didn't seem to be getting closer in a normal way; it didn't move or change its spot in the sky, it just got bigger and bigger until it was the only thing we could see. A blue line of atmosphere appeared along its curve. Usually space is empty, but this did not look empty, and the calculations for our approach were different from what the crew expected. On the bridge, the people were losing their focus.

An older crewman who had worked on ships for a long time sat at the station, his hands trembling slightly as he looked at the Moon. He missed a navigation adjustment, causing a stabilizer to fail. He spoke with a quiet hesitation, repeating the coordinate data instead of entering it. The other men watched him, their faces tight with a nervousness they were trying to hide.

Iris stepped forward, her own posture less rigid than usual. She tried to speak to him, her voice low but carrying through the quiet bridge. "The briefing covered this," she said, leaning toward the man. "The Moon's distance and its size—it was a military record. It was classified until this mission. They opened the files so the media and the army could understand why we're here, why the mission works."

The soldier looked at her. "If we hadn't done that," he said, his voice quiet. "If you hadn't hidden what was right in front of us, we wouldn't have been blind when they came. We wouldn't have to be out here right now."

Iris stopped. She looked around the bridge, realizing she had engaged a subordinate in an argument while everyone watched. She had no answer.

Lynn walked into the room. She had been standing in the hatchway, watching. She did not look at Iris. "His focus has failed," Lynn said. "He is a risk to the descent." She looked at Novak. "Remove him."

Novak moved the man toward the escape pods. He did not fight her. The pod sealed and launched in less than a minute, disappearing into the dark and leaving the room silent. No one tried to help the man or talk about him as they returned to their stations. They knew that if they stopped working, they would be next.

I watched as the bridge returned to work. Every station was occupied, but the silence remained.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The Moon did not merely grow; it loomed, a pale, scarred titan rising to consume the viewport. It didn't drift or move across the starfield; it simply expanded, becoming a wall of grey and white that eventually swallowed every other light in the universe. Along its jagged curve, a thin, impossible shimmer of sapphire light—a blue line of atmosphere—clung to the dead rock like a phantom. The bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle* became a tomb of whispered doubts. Calculations that had been gospel for decades were shattering against the reality before our eyes. We weren't approaching a lifeless satellite; we were invading a world that breathed.

Beside me, a veteran navigator’s composure snapped like dry rot. His hands danced a frantic, rhythmic tremor against the console, his eyes wide as if seeing his own ghost in the lunar craters. He missed the correction. The ship groaned, a lateral thruster screaming as it fought the sudden atmospheric drag. Fear in a soldier is like Fire in a forest—it consumes everything it touches.

Iris stepped into the fray, her voice a desperate anchor. "The records were classified," she pleaded, reaching for his shoulder. "This isn't a miracle; it's a military secret." But the soldier looked through her, his voice a hollow rasp. "You blinded us. You kept us in the dark while they built their towers under our noses."

Then, the air on the bridge turned cold. Lynn walked in, her presence as fluid and unyielding as a rising tide. She didn’t argue. She didn’t explain. She simply identified the blockage in the machine. "His focus has failed," she said, her voice a clinical blade. "He is no longer a component. He is a risk."

Novak moved with the mechanical grace of a gallows-man. The escape pod hissed, a brief sigh of pressure, and then the veteran was gone—jettisoned into the void he had once mastered. The bridge returned to its icy silence, every soul focused on the swelling grey landscape below. We were no longer explorers. We were the falling edge of a spear.

## Character Arc
**Lem's Record (Adolescent Wood Vessel):**
- **Somatic Recording:** While the crewman speaks, Lem records the physical details: the man's dilating pupils, the tremor in his fingers, and the way the officers' posture stiffens when Lynn enters.
- **Physical Stillness:** Lem remains in his corner. His lack of movement is a contrast to the frantic gestures of the crewman.

**Lynn's Authority:**
- **Economic Decision-Making:** Her decision to remove the soldier is presented as a navigation requirement. She prioritizes the function of the bridge over the individual.

**Novak's Function:**
- **Execution:** Novak carries out the command without pausing. Her movements are efficient and follow the established protocol for pod ejection.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Lunar Proximity:**
- The Moon occupies a larger portion of the viewport than the soldiers' training predicted. It grows larger without changing its relative position in the sky.
- **Atmospheric Visuals:** A thin, blue shimmer is visible on the edge of the lunar disk, indicating the presence of gas.

✅ **Core Management:**
- Lynn’s authority over the military is demonstrated through the crew's immediate compliance with her order to jettison a colleague.

✅ **Tone:**
- Ominous and clinical. The scale of the Moon is described through its physical impact on the bridge—shadows and light shifts.
- The chapter ends with the ship beginning its descent into the lunar atmosphere.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions about internal states (fear, panic, cruelty). Describe the physical evidence: silence, rapid speech, status lights.
- Avoid scientific jargon; describe the lunar atmosphere as a "shimmer" or "blue line."
- Balance discovery: Lem can mention that he later understood why the Moon's distance was hidden, but focuses on the shock of seeing it now.
- The Moon's growth is supernatural and absolute; it fills the sky without apparent motion.
