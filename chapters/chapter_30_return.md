## Synopsis
Following their physical reunion at the mission site, Myrr explains the dire situation in the North. He reveals that his band of shadow-walkers has been exiled from their own people to pursue a mission of revenge, while the rest of the White Forest villagers have fled to a secret sanctuary—a location Myrr's team cannot know for security reasons. From a high ridge, Lem observes the five villages currently encircled by Core monitoring pillars. Myrr explains the ideological deadlock: Arlo has become a Prophet, uniting the villages under a strict rejection of all technology, including the resistance's analog gear. This "Northern Schism" has made cooperation impossible. Lem, being minimalist and unarmed, resolves to enter the valley alone to investigate the connection between Arlo and the spirit of Maya.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Myrr’s team emerged from the brush—shadow-walkers who had traded everything for a chance at revenge. He told me the rest of their people had moved to a secret sanctuary far away, but they had stayed behind. They were bound by a vow of silence to protect their new home, and they were obsessed with a single mystery: the girl from my Moon memories and the boy from the village.

"We can't know where they went," Myrr explained, his voice hollow. "If the Core catches us, we can't betray a secret we don't have. We're the ghosts left behind to haunt the ones who burned us."

We climbed to a high ridge, looking down at the valley through Myrr’s long-range optics. The five villages were encircled by Core monitoring pillars—monolithic pillars of black glass that pulsed with a low, vibrating menace. They looked like giant needles stuck in the earth, watching for any sign of advanced technology. Myrr told me the Core justified them as protection against the Gorgons, but it was clear they were a cage.

But the villages weren't giving up. Myrr played me intercepted audio of Arlo’s sermons. I couldn't believe it was the same kid. His voice was deep and steady, carrying the weight of a man who had lived several lifetimes. He wasn't talking about gadgets or power; he was preaching about an ancestral law. He taught his people that their oral traditions were more authentic than any digital archive because they couldn't be hacked or erased. 

"He's using the same religion we follow," Myrr whispered, his voice tight. "The same calendar, the same prayers. But he says our analog tech is just a different color of the corruption. He thinks we've traded our souls for wooden armor."

I looked at Myrr’s heavy, living-wood armor and his glowing pulse-rifle. "They won't let you in, will they?"

"To them, we're worse than the Core," Myrr admitted. "We're the cousins who betrayed the Earth. We can't even get past the perimeter without triggering a fight because they think our presence poisons the soil."

I looked at my own hands. I was minimalist, made of crystal and fiber-optics, but I didn't carry a weapon. "I might be seen as clean," I said.

Myrr nodded. "You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see the man instead of the machine."

## Draft (13_PLUS)
Myrr’s warriors emerged from the brush—shadow-walkers who had traded their lives for a chance at vengeance. He told me of the Great Migration, how the rest of their kind had fled to a secret sanctuary behind the veil of the world. But they had stayed. They were the sentinels of the North, bound by a vow to find the truth of the girl in my memories and the boy who walked the village paths.

"We are the forgotten ones," Myrr said, gesturing to his scarred team. "The sanctuary remains hidden from us, a city of silence we can never visit. We chose this exile so that no torture could ever wring its location from our lips. We are the sword that protects the peace we can never share."

From the high ridge, the valley below looked like a garden strangled by thorns. The Core had planted their monitoring pillars—monolithic pillars of black glass—around the perimeter of the five villages. They hummed with a low, vibrating menace, a net of shadows that watched every movement. Myrr told me the Core called them shields against the Gorgons, but it was the same old tactic: create the threat, then sell the cage.

Yet, inside that cage, a new song was rising. We crouched in the brush and listened to the echoes of Arlo’s voice, carried upward by the wind and the rhythmic chanting of the villagers. The boy was gone. In his place was a man who spoke with the weight of mountains. He sang of the ancestral law, a path of living that existed before the first word was ever carved into stone or etched into a circuit. 

“He is speaking our own prayers,” Myrr whispered, his eyes fixed on the distant fires. “He follows the same sacred calendar, the same ancestral law that we carry in the forest. But he calls our tools a betrayal. He tells his people that our analog waves are just another flavor of the corruption that killed the old world. He is proving that to him, we are no longer kin.”

The truth was a bitter pill for Myrr. He and his warriors were as welcome in that valley as the Core itself. To the villagers, their living wood armor and pulse-rifles were just a different color of systemic corruption—a failure that had traded purity for protection.

“You are the only one who can walk through the gate,” Myrr said, laying a hand on my wooden shoulder. “You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive, no steel in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see you as a brother of the earth who still remembers the ancestral law. They might see the man instead of the machine.”

I looked at the valley below, knowing that my next step would be the most dangerous of all. I had to know if the connection to Maya was real, or if Arlo was simply a man lost in his own myth. I prepared to enter the valley alone. Myrr and his team remained on the ridge to maintain their silent vigil over the perimeter.
