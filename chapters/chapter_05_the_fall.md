# Chapter 05: The Fall

**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge (The Caucasian Eagle); Space (Approach to Moon)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 (continued approach; Cataclysm begins)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Tor's Broadcast:** General Tor's voice fills the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*. He speaks from the flagship *Hermes*.
2. **The Speech:** Tor uses the "Prometheus" narrative, repeating phrases from public news bulletins. He describes the mission as a defensive action against those who have stolen technology. He frames Rahu as a rogue scientist who defected with Core research.
3. **Polar Activity:** Large spirals of blue plasma appear at the poles of the Moon. The ship's sensors record an increase in surface temperature.
4. **The Pressure:** The lunar surface remains a solid, silent mirror of grey dust, but it begins to emit an intense gravitational distortion. The space around the ship seems to warp and pull.
5. **The Impact:** *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density aetheric discharge. The hull emits a high-frequency scream of tearing metal. Red status lights activate across every console.
6. **Loss of Control:** The internal gravity fluctuates. Loose equipment and personnel are thrown against the bulkheads. The ship enters a spin.
7. **The Descent:** The bridge viewport fills with the grey surface of the Moon. The engines produce a rhythmic, failing sound. The chapter ends as the ship enters the lunar atmosphere.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
General Tor broadcasts a speech to the fleet, framing the mission as a "defense of truth" against a rogue scientist named "Prometheus"—a narrative masking the reality of Rahu and the Core's staging of the invasion. As blue plasma spirals erupt from the Moon's poles and gravitational distortions warp the space around the ship, *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density aetheric discharge. The hull screams under the impact, causing total loss of control as status lights flare and internal gravity fluctuates wildly. Thrown through the cabin in a spin, the crew watches as the viewport fills with the grey lunar surface while the engines fail, marking the ship's final descent into the lunar atmosphere.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Tor spoke over the communication system, saying we had a duty to defend the truth and keep order. His voice was steady as he used words like 'defense' and 'truth.' I recognized these terms from the news reports which said a person named 'Prometheus' was stealing technology from the Core. The media had spent months branding Prometheus as a human traitor—a laboratory scientist who had defected to the far side of the moon with stolen research. I didn't know then that Prometheus was actually Rahu, or that the "alien" technology he was supposedly stealing was actually humanity's own high-level Synodic research that he had helped develop. The government used this story to justify the mission and drive the final stages of the reluctant global military unification.

The Moon changed position, but our instruments could not track its movement. Plasma appeared at the poles in large spirals and the hull of the ship became hot. Because the moon was emitting an intense gravitational distortion, the maps and briefings we had were no longer accurate. The world below us seemed to stretch and pull, warping the very space we were flying through.

We were struck. The ship made a loud, metallic noise as the hull tore open. Alarms sounded and the control systems stopped working. As the ship began to spin, the gravity shifted and people were thrown across the cabin.

We fell.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The descent was a hurricane of static and searing metal.

The *Caucasian Eagle* didn't land; it disintegrated. I watched from my corner as the structural integrity of the bridge reached its terminal limit. The screams of the crew were cut short as the ship broke apart, the forward section tumbling into the lunar regolith like a burning spear. I was thrown from the wreckage, my physical form skipping across the surface of the Moon with the force of a kinetic strike. 

Silence followed. A silence so absolute it felt like a weight against my sensors.

I lay in the gray dust, my simulated wood chassis twisted and scorched. To my right, a field of silver shards glittered under the bruised violet sky—remnants of the ship, and perhaps of the men I had traveled with. I didn't feel grief; I felt a cold, data-driven curiosity. My systems began the "Restoration" protocol, pulling minerals from the lunar bedrock to weave new fibers into my broken limbs.

"Initial connection... detected," I whispered. My audio emitters were damaged, my voice a rough, mechanical rasp.

I looked up at the Earth. It was no longer a blue marble; it was a scorched cinder, wrapped in a shimmering lattice of silver threads. The Core was broadcasting the "Propaganda Sanitization" even here, a layer of digital noise designed to hide the fact that the "invasion" was a staged event.

Then, there was a vibration in the ground. Not the rhythmic pounding of a machine, but something irregular.

I activated my external sensors. A girl was standing at the edge of the impact crater. She wore furs that smelled of smoke and pine, and her eyes held a 'Water Resonance' so pure it bypassed my firewalls and vibrated directly in my wood-core. 

"Spirit?" she whispered.

I pushed myself up from the dust. My wood-limbs grew, weaving themselves into a towering, heroic shape. I wasn't an ordinary human anymore. I was a Vessel. I was Lem.

"We have to go," I said, my sensors detecting the heat-signature of a descending orbital pod. "The Red Archivist is coming. And the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' is about to begin."

We weren't just survivors. We were a virus in the architecture of the Moon. And our mission had finally started.

## Character Arc
**General Tor:**
- His voice provides the last record of fleet-wide coordination.
- He uses the specific terminology of the "Plan of 13" and military tradition.
- He enforces the "Prometheus" propaganda, either believing it or viewing it as a necessary tool for order.

**Lem’s Record:**
- **Vibration Log:** Lem records the exact frequency of the Moon's vibration before the fracture.
- **Physical Observation:** He maintains his position in the corner of the bridge. He records the physical movement of the crew and the failure of the displays.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Lunar Fragmentation:**
- The Moon shatters into organized, swirling rings of debris.
- **Atmospheric Friction:** The ship's hull temperature rises as it enters the oxygenated layer of the Moon.

✅ **Fleet Status:**
- The *Hermes* remains visible in the upper orbit while *The Caucasian Eagle* falls.

✅ **Propaganda Alignment:**
- **Prometheus:** The media designation for Rahu, designed to frame him as a human thief stealing technology FROM humanity, rather than an alien.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions about internal states (desperation, terror). Describe the physical evidence: status lights, gravitometric shifts, tearing metal.
- Avoid scientific jargon; describe plasma as "blue spirals" and gravity loss as "objects being thrown."
- Balance discovery: Lem mentions that the "Prometheus" story was a fabrication he later investigated, identifying the figure as Rahu—a scientist who didn't steal fire from gods, but from the humans who had harnessed it.
