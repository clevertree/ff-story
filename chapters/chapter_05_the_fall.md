# Chapter 05: The Fall

**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge (The Caucasian Eagle); Space (Approach to Moon)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 (continued approach; Cataclysm begins)
1. **Tor's Broadcast:** General Tor's voice fills the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*. He speaks from the flagship *Hermes*.
2. **The Speech:** Tor uses the "Prometheus" narrative, repeating phrases from public news bulletins. He describes the mission as a defensive action against those who have stolen technology. He frames Rahu as a rogue scientist who defected with Core research.
3. **Polar Activity:** Large spirals of blue plasma appear at the poles of the Moon. The ship's sensors record an increase in surface temperature.
4. **The Fragmentation:** The lunar surface breaks into geographic sections. The fragments do not scatter but form a swirling ring of debris.
5. **The Impact:** *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a fragment of lunar rock. The hull emits a high-frequency scream of tearing metal. Red status lights activate across every console.
6. **Loss of Control:** The internal gravity fluctuates. Loose equipment and personnel are thrown against the bulkheads. The ship enters a spin.
7. **The Descent:** The bridge viewport fills with the grey surface of the Moon. The engines produce a rhythmic, failing sound. The chapter ends as the ship enters the lunar atmosphere.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
General Tor frames the mission as a "defense of truth" as the lunar base descends into chaos.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Tor spoke over the communication system, saying we had a duty to defend the truth and keep order. His voice was steady as he used words like 'defense' and 'truth.' I recognized these terms from the news reports which said a person named 'Prometheus' was stealing technology from the Core. The media had spent months branding Prometheus as a human traitor—a laboratory scientist who had defected to the far side of the moon with stolen research. I didn't know then that Prometheus was actually Rahu, or that the "alien" technology he was supposedly stealing was actually humanity's own high-level Synodic research that he had helped develop. The government used this story to justify the mission and drive the final stages of the reluctant global military unification.

The Moon changed position, but our instruments could not track its movement. Plasma appeared at the poles in large spirals and the hull of the ship became hot. Because the surface of the moon was breaking into pieces, the maps and briefings we had were no longer accurate. Large rocks flew into space in many directions.

We were struck. The ship made a loud, metallic noise as the hull tore open. Alarms sounded and the control systems stopped working. As the ship began to spin, the gravity shifted and people were thrown across the cabin.

We fell.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

General Tor’s voice bled through the comms, a deep, resonant rumble that felt like the earth itself speaking from the flagship *Hermes*. He spoke of 'Prometheus,' a name stolen from myth to mask the fire of our own stolen genius. The propaganda was a masterwork: Rahu was framed as a human scientist, a low-level researcher who had betrayed the Core and fled to the Moon with the blueprints of the Synodic project. I recorded the lie, noting how the crew tightened their grips on their consoles, fueled by a manufactured righteous fury against a 'traitor' who had merely taken back what humans had originally stolen from the earth.

But the Moon had its own truth to tell. Great spirals of cerulean plasma erupted from the lunar poles, twisting through the black like the aurora of a dying god. The hull of *The Caucasian Eagle* began to vibrate at a frequency that set my teeth on edge. The surface below was no longer a solid plane; it was fracturing into vast, geometric islands, a world-sized puzzle coming apart in a slow-motion dance of debris.

The impact was not a sound, but a shudder that moved through the marrow of the ship. A fragment of lunar stone tore through our side, and the hull emitted a high-pitched metallic shriek—the scream of a dying beast. Red light washed over the bridge, thick as blood. Gravity became a fickle ghost, throwing men against the bulkheads as the stars began to spin into a sickening blur.

Through the viewport, the grey surface rushed up to meet us, jagged and hungry. We weren't just descending; we were being pulled into the maw of a broken world. The engines gave one final, rhythmic cough of defiance, and then there was only the roar of the wind.

## Character Arc
**General Tor:**
- His voice provides the last record of fleet-wide coordination.
- He uses the specific terminology of the "Plan of 13" and military tradition.
- He enforces the "Prometheus" propaganda, either believing it or viewing it as a necessary tool for order.

**Lem’s Record:**
- **Vibration Log:** Lem records the exact frequency of the Moon's vibration before the fracture.
- **Physical Observation:** He maintains his position in the corner of the bridge. He records the physical movement of the crew and the failure of the displays.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Lunar Fragmentation:**
- The Moon shatters into organized, swirling rings of debris.
- **Atmospheric Friction:** The ship's hull temperature rises as it enters the oxygenated layer of the Moon.

✅ **Fleet Status:**
- The *Hermes* remains visible in the upper orbit while *The Caucasian Eagle* falls.

✅ **Propaganda Alignment:**
- **Prometheus:** The media designation for Rahu, designed to frame him as a human thief stealing technology FROM humanity, rather than an alien.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions about internal states (desperation, terror). Describe the physical evidence: status lights, gravitometric shifts, tearing metal.
- Avoid scientific jargon; describe plasma as "blue spirals" and gravity loss as "objects being thrown."
- Balance discovery: Lem mentions that the "Prometheus" story was a fabrication he later investigated, identifying the figure as Rahu—a scientist who didn't steal fire from gods, but from the humans who had harnessed it.
