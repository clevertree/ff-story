# Chapter 4: Drafted

**Setting:** Spacecraft launch facility, Earth
**POV:** Lem
**Narrative Arc:** Lem boards the desperate human mission; encounters bureaucracy and authority

---

At the ship's entrance, Lem follows a line of soldiers being processed for boarding. A guard stops him, questioning his authorization. Lem presents a tablet containing official orders authorizing his immediate drafting into the military. The scan is valid—but incomplete. It shows that Lem has not undergone the mandatory mission briefing.

The guard refuses entry, citing protocol. Linn intervenes, invoking her special authority. She declares that Lem is exempt from the briefing requirement. Reluctantly, the guard complies.

Before departing, Linn instructs Lem to remain embedded with the soldiers and to follow all orders given to him. She assures him that she will be monitoring him continuously, though she does not explain how. Then she leaves.

Lem finds himself sealed inside the massive spacecraft among hundreds of soldiers. The ship is enormous, equipped with newly declassified anti-gravity propulsion—technology revealed only because the situation has become too desperate to conceal it. As the ship prepares for launch, Lem listens to the soldiers' conversations, slowly absorbing fragments of information about the mission and the scale of the crisis.
