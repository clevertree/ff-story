# Chapter 4: Drafted

**Setting:** Spacecraft boarding facility, Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day -1 (immediately after Chapter 3)
**POV:** Lem
**Estimated Length:** 2,500-3,000 words

---

## Chapter Outline

1. **Processing:** Lem in line with soldiers; boarding checkpoint
2. **Authentication Issue:** Guard questions authorization; tablet shows incomplete records (no briefing)
3. **Lynn's Override:** She appears briefly to override ritual; guard complies
4. **Final Instructions:** Lynn instructs Lem to embed with soldiers, follow orders, mentions remote monitoring
5. **Separation:** Lynn departs; Lem enters spacecraft alone
6. **Scale Revealed:** Lem observes massive ship; anti-gravity technology; hundreds of soldiers
7. **Embedded Observation:** Lem begins listening to soldiers' conversations; absorbing mission context
8. **Transition:** Ship prepares for launch; Lem isolated among humans

## Character Arc

**Lem's Role Solidifies:**
- He transitions from activated subject to embedded operative
- Begins his function as obarchive/infiltrator
- His compulsion is demonstrated through mechanical following of orders
- He is now isolated—Lynn gone, surrounded by humans who don't know his nature

**Lem's Perspective Deepens:**
- He begins absorbing information through observation and listening
- He is processing the scale of the crisis through soldiers' conversations
- His disconnection (from Chapter 1) now takes on new meaning—he's observing rather than participating

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Facts Applied:**
- Anti-gravity propulsion technology exists and is classified
- Military is launching a desperate, likely suicide mission
- The crisis forces revelation of previously hidden technology
- Lynn has absolute authority over military ritual
- Remote monitoring/surveillance of Lem is possible (method unspecified)
- Soldiers are being sent to the Moon without full briefing (implies psychological preparation)

✅ **Bureaucracy vs. Authority:**
- Protocol exists (mandatory briefing) but can be overridden
- This shows Core's penetration of military hierarchy

## Key Scenes/Beats

| Beat | Lem's State | External Action | Information Revealed | Tone |
|------|-----------|---|---|---|
| Boarding line | Compelled | Lem processes; follows soldiers | This is a military mission | Procedural |
| Guard stops him | Compliant | Presents tablet | He has official authorization but gaps in record | Tension |
| Briefing gap | Confused | Guard questions the gap | Mandatory briefing is standard ritual | Stakes |
| Lynn intervenes | Relief/dread | She overrides; guard complies | Her authority is absolute | Power demonstration |
| Final instructions | Attentive | Lynn: embed, follow orders, I'm monitoring | Remote surveillance is possible | Isolation |
| Lynn departs | Abandoned | He watches her leave | He's now alone among humans | Vulnerability |
| Into spacecraft | Overwhelmed | Crowds of soldiers boarding | Scale and urgency sink in | Scale revelation |
| Technology observation | Curious | Anti-gravity tech visible/discussed | Classified tech now revealed | World-shaping |
| Soldier conversations | Observing | Absorbs fragments about mission | Mission involves Moon; desperate | Intelligence gathering |
| Ship prepares | Waiting | Launch rituals begin | Departure is imminent | Tension build |

## Critical Questions / Ambiguities

❓ **Why is Lem's presence so shocking to the guard?**
- He is a **teenager** who appears barely out of high school, standing among seasoned soldiers.
- He has a mandatory briefing gap—suggests briefing is usually universal.
- **Impact:** Shows Lynn prioritizes his embedding over his preparation and conventional age restrictions.

❓ **How does Lynn's remote monitoring work?**
- Aether-based telepathy? Technological surveillance? Implant?
- **Recommendation:** Leave unspecified; mystery amplifies Lem's sense of being watched

❓ **What is the soldiers' pre-mission psychology?**
- Are they aware they might not survive?
- Do they know what they're actually facing on the Moon?
- **Sets up:** Chapter 5's exploration of information warfare

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)

- Show Lem's compulsion as mechanical—he doesn't question the boarding, just follows
- Emphasize the scale and strangeness of the spacecraft technology
- Use soldiers' fragments of conversation to gradually reveal mission stakes
- Lem's observation/listening should feel like his primary function now
- Contrast Lem's isolation with the crowded spacecraft (alone among hundreds)
- End with ship preparing for launch—no turning back
