# Chapter 23: The Village Encounter

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Northern Forest - Non-Tech Village

---

## Outline / Summary

The Core deployment lands near a primitive village composed of organic wood-and-stone structures. The contrast is jarring: the high-tech, black hovercrafts landing in a place that looks like it belongs in the 17th century. Lem and the soldiers under Mission 2 orders begin the "occupation."

The villagers are terrified—not just of the landing crafts, but of the very people claiming to be their saviors. Lem observes them from his "Bourne Profile" perspective: the tremors in their hands, the way they hide their children. He hears their angry discussions and learns the truth: the "distress call" was initiated by a **tech beacon** that the Core installed against the villagers' will. They even killed several men to stop it from being built.

Despite their hatred, the villagers are trapped. The Gorgon pods are opening just a few miles away, and they have no weapons capable of stopping an "alien" threat. Under the watchful eye of a **Metal Vessel** and Lia Vane's harmonic instructions, the soldiers begin setting up a massive artillery array in the village square. Lem is ordered to mount one of the large guns—a physical compulsion he cannot resist, though his mind recoils.

A local teenage villager, **Arlo**, returns after scouting the impact site. Unlike the others, he doesn't cower; he carries a scavenged Core sensor in his belt, much to the anger of the village elders. Arlo is breathless, reporting that the "Builders" (Gorgons) are ignoring the village and moving with focused intent toward the south. His observation is dismissed as "machine-worship" by the elders, but Lem takes note of the boy's calm, technical reporting.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Deeply empathetic toward the villagers. He sees the hypocrisy of the Core's "mission" but is trapped inside his own body by the remote control.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Hearing the truth about the tech beacons and the villagers' resistance.
    2. Feeling the physical "hijack" as he is forced to man an artillery gun.
    3. Observing **Arlo's** arrival; recognizing a kindred spirit in the boy who isn't afraid of the tech.

### Arlo
- **Role:** The Village Scout / Outcast.
- **Beat:** Returns with technical details of the Gorgon approach. He catches Lem's eye while Lem is "slaved" to the artillery gun, seeing the boy inside the machine.

### The Villagers
- **Status:** Resentful and dependent. They recognize the Core as a parasitic force that used the "threat" to force their way in. They treat Arlo with open hostility, viewing his "tech-welding" as a curse.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Tech Beacons (Manufactured Conflict):** Their role in forcing settlements into Archivist dependency.
✅ **Non-Tech Societies:** How the "Great Fry" and the Core's control have marginalized natural human development.
✅ **Artillery & Occupation:** The Core's methodical military presence.

## Notes & Spoilers

- **Internal Spoiler:** Lia Vane's "idealism" is being used as a cover for a brutal land-grab.
