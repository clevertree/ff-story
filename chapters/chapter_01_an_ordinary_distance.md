# Chapter 1: An Ordinary Distance

**Setting:** Lem's suburban home; Earth, early 202X (Before Time)
**POV:** Lem
**Narrative Arc:** Introduction to ordinary life before Cataclysm; escalation of lunar threat

---

Lem lives an unremarkable life in a world that looks much like our own. His days are defined by routine, and his understanding of reality is shaped almost entirely by news broadcasts and public information. When reports begin to surface about strange anomalies on the far side of the Moon, Lem treats them as distant curiosities—important, perhaps, but abstract and safely removed from his personal life.

As coverage intensifies, the tone of the news shifts. Governments confirm the presence of non-human structures on the Moon, and soon after, reports emerge of massive tripod-like machines entering Earth's atmosphere. According to the broadcasts, these machines crash-land near mountain ranges far from cities, reassemble themselves, and begin slow, deliberate marches toward population centers, typically arriving by nightfall.

Lem watches the coverage with mild detachment—until the threat reaches his city. News outlets announce the first confirmed sightings of the machines cresting the distant mountains. Stepping outside, Lem sees it for himself: enormous silhouettes moving against the horizon, impossibly large and undeniably real. Around him, the streets fill with people evacuating, panic spreading unevenly through the crowd. Ordinary life begins to fracture.

Despite the chaos, Lem feels oddly disconnected. Like many others, he follows instructions, waits for updates, and assumes that someone, somewhere, understands what is happening. That illusion shatters when a military convoy arrives directly in front of his home.
