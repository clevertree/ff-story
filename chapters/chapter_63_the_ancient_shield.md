## Chapter Outline

1.  **Toppling the Beacons:** The Synodic army approaches the city beacons. Despite the visible torment the signals cause them, the machines endure the pain to topple the towers. The Core's control network begins to shatter.
2.  **The Crisis of Faith:** City civilians snap out of their "slumber." They begin asking basic questions about the cities' design. The Core media scapegoats designers and power engineers, sentencing them for "contempt of duty" to distract the masses.
3.  **The Hidden Arsenal:** As the Synodics approach the central desert base (Cradle Zero), the Core activates its final line of defense.
4.  **Synodic-Manufactured Relics:** Massive projectile guns and missile batteries emerge from the mountains and the desert floor. These are examples of **Normal technology built by Synodic technology**—conventional 21st-century ballistics manufactured with Synodic industrial speed. They are distinct from the Core's more sophisticated plasma weapons, which are entirely Synodic and rely on internal charges.
5.  **The Slaughter:** The countermeasures fire immediately. The kinetic force of the non-Synodic missiles is devastating against the wood-and-fluid frames of the Synodics. Striders are vaporized. Monoliths take hundreds of direct hits, enduring the cannon fire for minutes before their massive frames finally topple.
6.  **The False Victory:** The desert is littered with Synodic carcasses. Lasers continue to fire at the "dead" machines to ensure total destruction. General Tor announces on the broadcast that the battle has been won.
7.  **The Crew's Despair:** At the White Forest, the Crew watches the slaughter. They feel they were "too late" to make a difference.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Ancient Guns" should feel mechanical, loud, and brutally efficient—a contrast to the silent, elegant hooting of the machines.
-   The "toppling of the beacons" should be a moment of extreme physical tension.
-   End the chapter with the hush of the guns cooling and Tor's hollow victory announcement.
