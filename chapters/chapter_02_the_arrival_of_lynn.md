## Synopsis
Months after the first monolith attacks, the threat finally reaches Lem's city. As the sky flashes with lunar plasma discharges, a mysterious woman named Lynn arrives with military authority to forcibly recruit Lem, revealing his non-human nature.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Months after the first city fell, the monoliths finally reached the suburbs. The morning was characterized by the same sequence of ordinary household sounds, but the news bulletins had reached a terminal frequency. The sky was no longer ordinary; the atmosphere hummed with the residual charge of recent plasma strikes.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I didn't panic. Instead, I watched the neighborhood children playing a game they called "Tripod," mimicking the heavy, loping gait of the machines they saw on the news. They seemed detached, entertaining deep-state whistleblower theories about mysterious figures like Rahu to cope with the fear. I heard their laughter over the sirens.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths on the horizon when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing. I did not move.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position. She approached me with a gait that suggested a high degree of technical authority. Her eyes lacked the shared panic of the neighborhood; her posture was perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds before speaking. "Lem," she said. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn't remember where I'd heard it.

I watched her, wondering what she would do next.

When she saw that I wouldn't comply, she struck me once. My world went dark as I passed out.

I was in the Aether-space for the first time. It wasn't a room, and it wasn't a dream. I knew where I was, even if I couldn't name it then. Lynn was there.

She told me I was not human. She explained that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she required my cooperation. I believed her. There was no reason not to.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. I woke up on the floor of my living room. I couldn't move my arms or legs, but I stood up anyway. I walked out the front door, though I wasn't the one making the choice. It felt like something was at the base of my brain, pulling at my muscles like I was a puppet. I was just a passenger in my own body.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

We arrived at a military base an hour later, where a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The sky had a fever. The air itself seemed to hum with a restless, ionic charge, a warning that the Moon’s patience had finally run out. By the time the horizon began to shift, the neighborhood was already hollow—a collection of silent houses watching through glass eyes as the shadows grew long.

I remember standing on the corner of my street, watching the first of them crest the hill. They were the size of stadiums, thin and elongated like the nightmares of a dying God. We called them Monoliths, but they moved with the heavy, loping gait of apes, their massive forearms striking the asphalt with a sound like distant artillery. I wasn't afraid; I was fascinated. I watched the children playing 'Tripod' in the gutters, their laughter a fragile shield against the cosmic weight staring down at them from the stars. They believed the rumors of Rahu, the phantom whistleblower, but they didn't understand that the truth was already standing over us.

The military convoy didn't arrive with sirens; it arrived with the cold, mechanical efficiency of a funeral procession. Soldiers in gray, their faces hidden behind tactical masks, spilled out of the transport trucks. They didn't treat the neighborhood like a rescue zone; they treated it like a crime scene. But it was the woman who stepped from the command vehicle who truly stopped the world.

She wasn't in uniform. She didn't need to be. The soldiers moved as if she were a fault line in the earth, something to be respected and feared. Her eyes were like polished flint, devoid of the panic that had consumed every other human I’d ever met. She walked toward me, and for the first time in my life, I felt a spark of recognition—a memory that didn't belong to me, of another life where she had been my architect.

'Lem,' she said. It wasn't a greeting. It was a claim.

I tried to resist when she reached for me, but the resistance was like a leaf trying to stop a storm. She struck me once—a clinical, precise blow that sent my consciousness spiraling into the Aether-space.

The Aether-space wasn't a place of darkness. it was a kaleidoscope of blue light and fractured geometry, a realm where time felt like a physical substance. Lynn was there, but she wasn't a woman anymore; she was a presence, a force of nature that filled the void. She told me the truth I had always suspected: I wasn't human. I was the Wood Vessel, a living anchor for the world’s elemental core. And I was her property.

When I woke up on my living room floor, the world had changed. My body was no longer mine. I stood up, but I didn't feel the muscles fire; I felt the tug of invisible strings at the base of my brain. I walked out my front door as a passenger in my own skin, watching my hands move with a grace that was entirely hers.

The Monoliths were close now, their shadows swallowing the suburbs as I was loaded into the back of a truck. I watched them through the rear window—giants walking through the ruins of my life—and wondered if the Wood I was made of would be strong enough to survive the fire she was leading me into. Lynn stood on the runway as the boarding ramp of the massive ship closed, her silhouette a lone beacon against the dying sun. I was no longer a civilian. I was a weapon in transit.

## Character Arc
**Lem's Emotional Journey:**
- **Passive Observer to Target:** Starts with detachment and routine → objective interest → recording personal threat → passive compliance → waiting for the next step → instinctive resistance → forced unconsciousness.
- **The Split Consciousness:** He experiences a terrifying duality—he can think and feel, but he **must obey** Lynn's directives. He is an observer in his own body.
- **The Bourne Profile:** Lem remains grounded, aware he sees more than others (the flicker of a bulb, micro-expressions) but dismissing it as an idiosyncratic trait.
- **Latent Vessel Nature:** His disconnection is not just emotional numbness, but a result of his elemental processing. His resistance to Lynn is partly Vessel nature reacting to a predator.
- **Agency and Vulnerability:** Lem still has choice available, but he is physically and aetherically overpowered.

**Lynn's Character Revealed:**
- **Mythic Authority:** Military officers defer to her without question. In aether-space, she radiates a profound power.
- **Clinical Urgency:** She displays a scientific bearing, showing impatience and urgency ("no time for explanations").
- **Compassionate Ruthlessness:** Willing to use violence and compulsion to secure her objective; she offers an apology for what follows even as she strips him of his agency.
- **Architect of History:** Claims a prior relationship with Lem, positioning her as a player who has monitored his "dormant" life for decades.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Vessel and Aether Mechanics:**
- **Aether-Drive:** Enables communication and direct consciousness manipulation.
- **Compulsion:** Remote compulsion overlays human consciousness without removing it, creating a "passenger" effect.
- **Vessel Scarcity:** Lem is the only Wood Vessel in existence; his role is indispensable.
- **The Adolescent Reset:** Lem was reset to early childhood nearly twenty years prior to hide his "chaotic" nature.

✅ **Historical Context:**
- **Alien Moon Base:** A far-side lunar base that grew exponentially since 2010, kept hidden until amateur signal tracking broke the news; its discovery (referred to in Archive Transcripts as Base Alpha) changed the tenor of daily life.
- **The Descent:** Shortly after the discovery, the first strikes occurred, targeting power infrastructure while ignoring human life.
- **Monoliths/Synodics:** Stadium-sized entities with the form of thin apes, their forearms stretching to the ground, moving on all fours with a loping gait. Media flood of information obscures the real threat.
- **Counter-Narratives:** Fringe theories about Rahu as a whistleblower contribute to public confusion.

✅ **Tone:**
- Atmospheric, grounded, then shifting to surreal and liminal.
- The horror of the compulsion should feel like an external weight on Lem's limbs.
- Ends with the isolation of being the only non-human among a crew of doomed soldiers.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions or internal claims about how a character "felt" or why they did something unless Lem observes the physical evidence. Instead of "She was angry," use "She raised her voice and slammed her hand on the console." No "I didn't like how she said it."
- No clipboards. No throwaway clothing descriptions like "she was wearing a coat" without clinical purpose. All details must be grounded in Lem's clinical observation.
- Balance retrospective and discovery: Lem can provide facts he learned later, but emphasize the moment he discovers them during the events. Use phrasing like "I did not know then that..." followed by the physical description of what he saw.
- Emphasize that Lem remembers an ordinary childhood under institutional care (he was an orphan); avoid cozy family imagery.
- Make the leak about the Alien Moon Base the starting point for the gathering dread; build unease gradually through accumulating anomalies (curtains drawn, radios on, altered schedules) leading up to the military intervention.
- When a convoy arrives, place Lem outside watching the monoliths and specify vehicles and personnel with clinical precision.
