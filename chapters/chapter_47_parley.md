# Chapter 47: Parley

**Setting:** **Ait-Aman** / The outskirts of the **Wuxan Pentad**
**Timeline:** Year 1022 (Year 22 AT)

## Synopsis
While the **Voidsmen** rapidly construct a massive ground and air defense system by relocating and respawning White Forest tree assets around the **Wuxan Pentad**, Arlo’s sermon is interrupted by the arrival of a Core diplomatic craft. Pausing his address, Arlo meets Cassia Vane—and Kiran, an old friend from the village who chose the Core—at the ramp of her ship for a final, private conversation about the impending threat.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Tactical Relocation:** Following their conviction to protect the North, the **Voidsmen** relocate specialized modular mechanical trees from the White Forest to the outskirts of the **Wuxan Pentad**. These trees are moved and replanted to form a massive defensive perimeter around the valley.
2. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
3. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
4. **Defensive Germination:** Under the northern sun and supplemented by analog energy pulses from the **Voidsmen**, the mechanical flora undergoes rapid growth, creating a dense "Wooden Shield" of bio-mechanical structures.
5. **The Ground and Air Phalanx:** Within days, the **Voidsmen** use their mind-link technology to refashion the groves into ground-based defensive walkers and anti-air bio-mechanical turrets, preparing for a full ground and air defense of the villages.
6. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
7. **The Sighting:** After the second day of setting up the defenses, the **Voidsmen** notice a massive floating island—**Ark Prime**—silhouetted in the distant haze. The **Iron Pillar** has arrived and remains stationary on the horizon.
8. **The Delegation Launch:** Arlo is delivering a sermon on the village platform in **Ait-Aman** in front of a great smoldering pyre when a sleek, white Core diplomatic craft is seen launching from the floating island. It descends and lands near the village entrance.
9. TODO: Describe the ship/delegation.
10. **The Diplomatic Break:** Arlo pauses his speech. He descends from the platform and walks toward the landing zone as Cassia Vane and a group of "First Citizens" emerge from the ship.
11. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
12. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
13. **Reunion of the Outcasts:** Kiran is with Cassia on the diplomatic craft, standing behind her - someone Arlo has not seen in years since his departure from **Ait-Aman** for the Core internship.
14. **The Cargo of Memory:** Before meeting the delegation, Arlo pulls Myrr aside. He hands him the Glass Locket containing the **Invisible Grain**. He explains that while he will not look at the data himself, he recognizes that Myrr’s Voidsmen are the true guardians of history now. He asks Myrr to keep it safe, not as a weapon, but as a gift of gratitude for the "Wooden Shield" protecting his people. Myrr accepts it, unaware that this microscopic grain is the only untainted record of the Before Time.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Subject present at the perimeter of the "Wild Swarm." Negotiator-unit Ku initiated contact with the Voidsman leadership. Status: Voidsmen refuse further "Triple Synthesis" tribute to the Core.

Visual data: Maya’s current form is 60% stabilized aether. She is functioning as a literal "Grounding Rod" for the planetary energy-grid.

Rahu delivered the Core's ultimatum: Absolute surrender or "Surface-Scrub." Note: Rahu's vocal processors show a 15% increase in synthetic inflection. Probability of total personality-overwrite: High.

Strategic Update: The Voidsmen are not preparing for a parley; they are utilizing the time to calibrate the "Resonance-Tuning" of the Gorgon swarm. Subject anticipates a non-verbal solution.
## Draft (13_PLUS)

The landscape of the North had been transformed by the urgent necessity of defense. In the span of a few days, the outskirts of the **Wuxan Pentad** had been fortified by the arrival of the **Voidsmen**’s modular trees. These mechanical sentinels, transported in dormant fragments and brought to life by the **Voidsmen**’s analog pulses, had taken root with a terrifying speed. Through the mind-link, the **Voidsmen** had refashioned the growing grove into a phalanx of ground-based walkers and towering anti-air batteries, weaving a "Wooden Shield" that bristled against the gray sky.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

Beneath this canopy of living steel, the sky cracked with the arrival of the Core. A white ship, polished to a mirror sheen, descended like a cold star into the heart of **Ait-Aman**. Arlo did not flinch. He stopped his sermon, the silence falling over the crowd like a heavy cloak, and walked toward the white metal. At the foot of the ramp, he met Cassia Vane, and behind her, the familiar face of Kiran. Arlo’s first words are for his former neighbor, acknowledging the years since his departure.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

"I have come to speak of the end," Cassia said, her voice barely audible over the hum of the ship's engines. She drew him into the shadow of the craft, away from the eyes of the ambassadors.

Beside me, Myrr was silent, his gaze fixed on the small glass locket Arlo had entrusted to him before the ship landed. "He called it a gift of gratitude," Myrr murmured. "The **Invisible Grain**. He said the **Voidsmen** are the true guardians of the past now." 

I sensed a pulse from the locket—a high-frequency resonance that my sensors couldn't quite categorize. It was more than a relic; it was a payload of uncorrupted data, a microscopic archive waiting for an expert's hand.

Arlo listened with the patience of a mountain. He knew the terms before they were spoken. The Core had exhausted its patience; the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" was cracking, and they needed a final, bloody demonstration to seal the narrative.

### Lem
- **The Witness of Preparation:** Lem notes the efficiency of the White Forest's bio-mechanical logistics, comparing it to the slow, heavy industrialism of the Core.
- **The Bridge:** He observes the interaction between Arlo and Cassia, noting the visible decay of Cassia's loyalty to the system she serves.

### Myrr (Off-screen / Context)
- **The Architect of the Shield:** Myrr's influence is seen in the rapid deployment of the defensive grove.
