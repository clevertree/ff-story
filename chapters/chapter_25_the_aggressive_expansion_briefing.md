# Chapter 25: The Aggressive Expansion Briefing

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Core Transport (In Flight) / Cradle Zero Perimeter

---

## Outline / Summary

Following the "sidelining" in the northern forest, Lem is transported back toward the equatorial regions. He is not being punished; instead, he is being "promoted" to a high-priority operation: **Mission 3 (Aggressive Expansion)**.

During the flight, Lia Vane provides the harmonic briefing. Her tone is efficient and focused. The objective is **Cradle Zero** and the surrounding hundreds of miles. The Core is no longer just "reclaiming"—they are building. Lem is shown holographic projections of shimmering, utopian cities: metropolises of light and resource abundance that will eventually house the "deserving" remnants of humanity.

Lia explains the logistical challenge. The desert is populated by "Wild Synodics"—evolved mechanical life that has forgotten its creators. The mission involves flying "Hover Bikes" (stripped-down, high-speed Aetheric vehicles) into the heart of the desert to plant **Disruption Beacons**. These beacons will drive the massive Monoliths away, clearing a "Safe Zone" for the construction drones.

Lem is told that this is his chance to become a true savior. By clearing the desert, he is creating a future where no human has to live in the "dirt" again. He observes the Metal Vessels around him—silent, identical, and perfectly obedient. He remembers **Arlo's** refusal, but as the hover-jets touch down in the baking heat of the desert base, the vision of a "perfect world" begins to cloud his skepticism.
