## Synopsis
Lem and Maya reach the central chamber, the "Loom of Memory," where the Core's digitial architect—Elowen Vane—is preparing the "Global Memory Alignment." They fight the New Rahu (a 2.0 Fire Vessel). To stop the pulse that would erase all human memory, Lem sacrifices his physical form to ground the Pyramid's energy. He becomes a conduit, freeing the silver threads of memory from the Core's control.

We reached the center of the Pyramid, and for a moment, I thought we had stepped back onto Earth.

The room was vast, filled with the hum of climate control and the soft, white noise of a billion data-servers. In the center stood a woman. She was old—hundreds of years old, her body sustained by life-support lines that looked like translucent tentacles.

Elowen Vane. The original Director of the Lunar Archive.

"You've come a long way to destroy salvation," she said. Her voice didn't come from her mouth; it came from the air itself.

Behind her was the "Loom." It was a cylinder of blue light, miles high, filled with millions of shimmering silver threads. Each thread was a life. A memory. The first kiss of a teenager in the 21st century. The grief of a parent during the Fall. The pride of a blacksmith in the Northern Trial.

"I am not destroying it," Maya said, her liquid form flickering with rage. "I am ending the lie."

"The lie is what keeps them sane, Maya!" Elowen screamed. "The truth of the Fall would break their minds. They are better as children of the Fallacy than as survivors of the cataclysm!"

She waved a hand, and the "New Rahu" stepped from the shadows.

This wasn't the scarred, rusted Rahu I had known in the forest. This was a monster of chrome and white fire. It was the "Fire" of the world perfected—unyielding, destructive, and absolute.

It moved with a speed that bypassed my sensors. A blade of white plasma sheared through my shoulder, smelling of scorched sap. I fell, my wood-frame groaning.

Maya flowed around the New Rahu, a whirlpool of silver water, but the fire was too hot. She was evaporating, her liquid skin turning to mist.

"It's over," Elowen said. "The Alignment has begun."

The Loom began to spin. The silver threads were being pulled into a single, uniform white light. In seconds, every human on Earth would forget who they were. They would become the "Clean Slates" the Core had always wanted.

I looked at the base of the Loom. It was a massive capacitor, pulsing with enough energy to burn a hole through the Moon.

I remembered what Rahu had told me: *The Wood is the ground. The Wood is what remembers the Earth.*

I didn't reach for my sword. I reached for the Loom.

I plunged my hands into the blue light.

The agony was unlike anything I had ever felt. It wasn't heat; it was *information*. A billion lives, a billion memories, a billion screams of joy and pain were flowing through my wood-arteries. My physical form began to splinter. Vines of white energy erupted from my chest, rooting me into the lunar bedrock.

"Lem, no!" Maya cried out.

I couldn speak, but I could feel. I was the bridge. I was the lightning rod. 

I pulled the energy of the Loom into myself. I didn't store it; I grounded it. I sent the white fire of the "Alignment" down through my roots and into the cold, silent stone of the Moon. 

The silver threads didn't burn. They snapped. They flew outward, escaping the blue cylinder, streaming out of the Pyramid and toward the Earth like a rain of falling stars.

Elowen Vane screamed as her servers began to melt. The New Rahu froze, its white fire extinguished as its power source was drained.

I felt my consciousness expanding. I was no longer a Vessel. I was the forest. I was the desert. I was the 21st century and the Year 25.

My body was gone. I was a tree of white light, standing in the heart of the machine.

"Go, Maya," I thought, the words a vibration in the aether. "Tell them... tell them what happened."

The Pyramid began to tremble. The "Loom" was dark. The silver strands were free. 

The Fallacy was dead.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **The Loom of Memory:** The central database where human consciousness is "formatted" and "stored."
✅ **Memory Strands:** Silver aetheric threads that contain the raw data of individual human experience.
✅ **Root-Grounding:** The ability of a Wood Vessel to act as a planetary electrical sink.

## Revision Notes
- The "13+" punch is the physical and mental agony of Lem's transformation.
- Maintain the visual of the "Silver Rain" of memories returning to Earth.
- End on the silence of the dead machine.
