## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Night Departure:** Lem and Arlo leave the village gates on foot. Per Arlo's conditions, they bring no vehicles and maintain absolute silence. 
2.  **The Long Arc:** They hike a long, winding trail that follows the shoreline of the deep lake at the village's back. The path is rugged and slow, emphasizing the biological reality of Arlo's current form compared to Lem's effortless endurance.
3.  **A Moment of Vertigo:** At a high point on the far side of the lake, Arlo pauses and looks back. The sky has turned a deep, bruised purple, and the village is a cluster of flickering torchlights reflected in the dark water.
4.  **The Farthest Point:** "This is the farthest I've ever been," Arlo whispers. It is a moment of profound vulnerability; the leader who held five villages together for a decade is finally stepping outside the world he protected.
5.  **Reaching the Camp:** They arrive at the forest clearing where Myrr and the "Crew" have set up a temporary shelter. The transition from the natural, torchlit world of the village to the shadowed, tech-cluttered camp of the resistance is stark.
6.  **Arlo's Observation:** Arlo is immediately struck by the Crew's technology—scavenged, matte-black, and practical. "This is not like the Core at all, is it?" he observes. He admits he could never convince his people to accept it, but expresses relief that *someone* has mastered it.
7.  **The Exchange of Worlds:** They spend hours in the shelter, sharing backstories. Arlo learns the full scale of the "Archivist" expansion and the global stakes. In turn, the Crew learns that Arlo's "Patch of Five" represents a massive, organized resistance movement that has successfully defied Core surveillance.
8.  **Myrr's Chilling Insight:** As the discussion turns to the search for the Water Vessel spirit, Myrr's expression darkens. He mentions a possibility that has been bothering him: the Core likely has the same Spiritual Resonance as Lem.
9.  **The Realization of Being Known:** If Lem's memory identified Arlo immediately, the Core—with its vast orbital reach and aetheric sensors—must have known for years that the Water Vessel's spirit survived in Arlo.
10. **The Unanswered Question:** The mood in the camp turns cold as the implications sink in. "If they knew," Myrr asks, "why did they never capture you? Why didn't they just destroy the village?" 
11. **The Fear of the Experiment:** This question chills Arlo. He realizes he might not be a "survivor" but a "subject" in a larger, unfinished Core experiment.
12. **The Resolve to Proceed:** Lem asks Arlo if he is sure he wants to continue with the interface link, noting that sometimes ignorance is safer.
13. **The Sacred Knowledge:** Arlo refuses to back down. "All knowledge is sacred," he says, "even false knowledge." He maintains that while the "Maya" story is likely just a simulation or a different version of the truth, he must know the threat.
14. **The Ultimate Motivation:** When Myrr asks why he's doing this if he's so skeptical, Arlo's answer is simple and final: "To save my village. I need to know how to stop what seems to be inevitable."

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Silent Obarchive:** Lem watches the interaction between the two types of human resistance (the technological Crew and the traditionalist Arlo) with growing fascination.
-   **Protective Instinct:** He feels a sudden, sharp need to protect Arlo from whatever truth the interface might reveal.

### Arlo
-   **Stoic Skepticism:** He transitions from the vertigo of leaving his home to a hardened resolve. He refuses to accept the "Vessel" identity as fact (Maya), treating it as a strategic piece of information rather than his true self.
-   **The Moral Center:** Arlo remains the emotional anchor of the group, reminding the tech-focused Crew that the goal is not just "defeating an enemy" but saving a culture.

### Myrr
-   **The Cynical Strategist:** His realization about the Core's awareness highlights the terrifying intelligence of the antagonist they are facing.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Core Surveillance Limits:** Questioning whether the Core's "blind spots" are accidental or intentional.
-   **The Sacredness of Knowledge:** The philosophical foundation of Arlo's resistance movement.
-   **Technology Philosophy:** The distinction between the Core's "Utopian" tech and the Crew's "Scavenged" tech.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "torchlight" moment should be the emotional peak of the chapter's first half.
-   Myrr's "chilling question" should be the turning point where the mood shifts from "reunion" to "horror."
-   The contrast between Arlo's hand-woven clothes and the Crew's scavenged armor should be visually emphasized in the camp light.
