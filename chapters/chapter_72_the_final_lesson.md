# Chapter 72: The Final Lesson

**Objective:** The Core uses orbital fire; Arlo's final sermon on betrayal.

**Key Events:**
- Just as Lem's crew seems to gain an advantage, a pillar of light from the sky vaporizes the second village completely.
- Panic breaks out among the surviving villagers; Arlo remains calm and continues his sermon.
- Arlo's sermon shifts to a darker tone, detailing human history's darkest moments of betrayal and failure.
- Cassia Vane pleads with Arlo to flee to the woods.
- Arlo's logic: Running is just "waiting for a different fire." It is better that the people die knowing the truth of their betrayal than live as slaves to the "benevolent" lie.
- The chapter ends with the ground vibrating from the next launch, and Lem realizing he is just a tool in a story without a hero.
