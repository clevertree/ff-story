## Synopsis
Attracted by a real-time pulse in his dreamscape, Lem returns to the site of his Northern Shield Mission detonation in the Northern Forest. He reunites with Myrr and a small band of resistance fighters who have remained behind while the rest of the White Forest fled to a secret sanctuary. From a high ridge, they observe the five villages encircled by Core monitoring pillars. Myrr explains that Arlo has become a Prophet, uniting the villages under a strict rejection of all technology, including the resistance's analog gear. This ideological schism has created a deadlock where the two groups cannot cooperate. Lem, being minimalist and unarmed, resolves to enter the village alone to investigate the connection between Arlo and the spirit of Maya.

The pulse in my head wasn't just a recording from the past. It was a live signal, a burning rhythm that pulled me back toward the North like a magnet. I had spent five years wandering, but the intensity of that flame finally forced me to stop running. I followed it back to the exact clearing where the Core had shattered me during the Northern Shield Mission.

The ground was still black and dead. As I stood there, I saw bits of my old self—jagged, silver shards of my metal frame—half-buried in the charcoal roots. They were still glowing with a faint, dying hum, like the teeth of a mechanical ghost.

"Don't move," a voice growled from the shadows.

A soldier in gleaming armor that rippled like the grain of an oak tree aimed a rifle at my chest. But then, he lowered it. He pulled off his helmet, and I almost didn't recognize him. It was Myrr. He looked older, his face mapped with scars from years of fighting, but his eyes were the same.

"Lem?" he whispered. "We thought you were just an echo. A shadow that didn't know it was dead."

His team emerged from the brush—shadow-walkers who had traded everything for a chance at revenge. Myrr told me the rest of their people had moved to a secret sanctuary far away, but they had stayed behind. They were bound by a vow of silence to protect their new home, and they were obsessed with a single mystery: the girl from my Moon memories and the boy from the village.

We climbed to a high ridge, looking down at the valley through Myrr’s long-range optics. The five villages were encircled by Core monitoring pillars—monolithic pillars of black glass that pulsed with a low, vibrating menace. They looked like giant needles stuck in the earth, watching for any sign of advanced technology. Myrr told me the Core justified them as protection against the Gorgons, but it was clear they were a cage.

But the villages weren't giving up. Myrr played me intercepted audio of Arlo’s sermons. I couldn't believe it was the same kid. His voice was deep and steady, carrying the weight of a man who had lived several lifetimes. He wasn't talking about gadgets or power; he was preaching about an ancestral law. He taught his people that their oral traditions were more authentic than any digital archive because they couldn't be hacked or erased. 

"He's using the same religion we follow," Myrr whispered, his voice tight. "The same calendar, the same prayers. But he says our analog tech is just a different color of the corruption. He thinks we've traded our souls for wooden armor."

I looked at Myrr’s heavy, living-wood armor and his glowing pulse-rifle. "They won't let you in, will they?"

"To them, we're worse than the Core," Myrr admitted. "We're the cousins who betrayed the Earth. We can't even get past the perimeter without triggering a fight because they think our presence poisons the soil."

I looked at my own hands. I was minimalist, made of crystal and fiber-optics, but I didn't carry a weapon. "I might be seen as clean," I said.

Myrr nodded. "You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see the man instead of the machine."

If Arlo was the only one who could reach the truth about the "Thousand-Year Fallacy," I had to try. I needed to know if the connection between him and Maya was real. I prepared to enter the valley. Myrr and his team remained on the ridge to maintain the surveillance of the perimeter.

The rhythm in my dreams was no ghost of the past. It was a beacon, a burning signal that screamed of things happening in the waking world. It pulled me North, a magnetic tug on my wooden soul that I could no longer ignore.

I stood at the place of my first death. The earth was still scarred, a circle of black ash where I had been shattered. I looked down and saw them—the jagged, silver teeth of my old self, the metal shell I had worn before the forest claimed me. They lay in the dirt like the bones of an extinct animal, still humming with a cold, dying memory of the Core.

“Drop the weapon,” a voice commanded.

I didn't have a weapon, only my hands and the wind. I turned to find a warrior in armor that rippled like the grain of an ancient oak. He held a rifle carved of the same living wood, his eyes hard behind a glass visor. When he pulled back his hood, I saw the face of an old friend. Myrr. He was older, his skin mapped with the scars of the years I had spent hiding.

“Lem?” he whispered, his voice cracking the silence. “We thought you were an echo. A shadow that didn’t know it was dead.”

His team emerged from the brush—shadow-walkers who had traded their lives for a chance at vengeance. Myrr told me of the Great Migration, how the rest of their kind had fled to a secret sanctuary behind the veil of the world. But they had stayed. They were the sentinels of the North, bound by a vow to find the truth of the girl in my memories and the boy who walked the village paths.

From the high ridge, the valley below looked like a garden strangled by thorns. The Core had planted their monitoring pillars—monolithic pillars of black glass—around the perimeter of the five villages. They hummed with a low, vibrating menace, a net of shadows that watched every movement. Myrr told me the Core called them shields against the Gorgons, but it was the same old tactic: create the threat, then sell the cage.

Yet, inside that cage, a new song was rising. We crouched in the brush and listened to the echoes of Arlo’s voice, carried upward by the wind and the rhythmic chanting of the villagers. The boy was gone. In his place was a man who spoke with the weight of mountains. He sang of the ancestral law, a path of living that existed before the first word was ever carved into stone or etched into a circuit. 

“He is speaking our own prayers,” Myrr whispered, his eyes fixed on the distant fires. “He follows the same sacred calendar, the same ancestral law that we carry in the forest. But he calls our tools a betrayal. He tells his people that our analog waves are just another flavor of the corruption that killed the old world. He is proving that to him, we are no longer kin.”

The truth was a bitter pill for Myrr. He and his warriors were as welcome in that valley as the Core itself. To the villagers, their living wood armor and pulse-rifles were just a different color of systemic corruption—a failure that had traded purity for protection.

“You are the only one who can walk through the gate,” Myrr said, laying a hand on my wooden shoulder. “You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive, no steel in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see you as a brother of the earth who still remembers the ancestral law. They might see the man instead of the machine.”

I looked at the valley below, knowing that my next step would be the most dangerous of all. I had to know if the connection to Maya was real, or if Arlo was simply a man lost in his own myth. I prepared to enter the valley. I left Myrr on the ridge and moved toward the northern trail that led through the monitoring pillars.
