## Chapter Outline

1.  **Solitude in the Smoke:** Following the evacuation of Myrr and the dwellers, Lem is left completely alone in the wilderness. The roar of the burning White Forest is the only sound apart from his own breathing.
2.  **The Vow of Exile:** Lem’s motivation is clear: he must lead away from the Core. He makes a silent vow to never engage with them or the Archivist "syndicate" ever again. He is no longer their asset.
3.  **The Scouting Arc:** Despite his desire to flee, Lem cannot leave without knowing what caused the destruction. He begins a wide, stealthy arc around the perimeter of the forest, using the high ridges to maintain a safe distance while gaining a line of sight.
4.  **The Source Revealed:** From a high vantage point, Lem observes a massive clearing being carved out on the windward side of the forest. He sees **Rahu** overseeing a legion of **Metal Vessels**.
5.  **Dismantling the Arsenal:** The Metal Vessels are methodically dismantling a vast array of colossal weapons—the heavy invisible heat rays. These are not standard nomadic Synodics, but high-output stationary platforms.
6.  **Recognition of Power:** Lem recognizes these machines from the **Mission 2 (Aggressive Expansion)** briefings. They are part of the vast, horrifying arsenal the Core can summon and build in remote locations almost instantly. 
7.  **The Demonstration of Force:** Lem realizes the attack wasn't a tactical necessity; it was a demonstration. The Core wiped out the forest and forced the inhabitants to flee simply because they could, and to prove that no sanctuary—artificial or analog—is beyond their reach.
8.  **The Final Departure:** Seeing Rahu’s clinical efficiency and the scale of the Core’s escalating force confirms Lem’s decision. There is nothing more to learn here and no one left to save.
9.  **The Long Walk:** Lem turns his back on the fire and the Core’s deployment. He begins to walk in the "most opposite direction" he can find, heading deep into the unknown wilderness of the North.
10. **Conclusion of Section:** The chapter ends with Lem’s lone figure disappearing into the grey horizon, marking the end of the "Awakening" arc and the beginning of his years in self-imposed exile.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **Strategic Observation:** He chooses to see the face of his enemy one last time before retreating, ensuring he understands the scale of the threat.
-   **Absolute Defection:** He moves from "disobedient asset" to "active deserter."
-   **The Weight of Knowledge:** He carries the "Key" and the Truth of 202X into the wilderness.

### Rahu (Observation Only)
-   **The Clinical Enforcer:** Seen from a distance, he represents the "perfected" version of a Vessel that the Core wants Lem to be—efficient, unquestioning, and lethal.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Archivist Arsenal:** Documentation of the Core's ability to fast-deploy massive stationary weaponry.
-   **Metal Vessel Utility:** Use of the shared-consciousness units for heavy logistical and dismantling tasks.
-   **The North's Scale:** Establishing the vastness of the northern wilderness as a place where even a Vessel can be lost.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Wide Arc" should be a sequence of sensory observation—the smell of hot metal, the shimmering air over the weapons, and the silent, coordinated movement of the Metal Vessels.
-   Rahu should feel like a ghost from another life—familiar but terrifyingly changed.
-   End on a cinematic note: a single figure walking away from a pillar of smoke that chokes the sky.
