# Chapter 26: The Stoic Refusal

**Setting:** Arlo's Village / The Diplomatic Hovercraft
**Timeline:** Year 1022 (Year 22 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Bell of Diplomacy:** Seven years (relative to 1015, two years relative to the retreat) of silence end as a sleek, white Core diplomatic craft lands in Arlo's village.
2. **The First Citizens:** Lem observes the Core's human emissaries—perfectly healthy "First Citizens" who advocate for the Hive's "Utopia."
3. **The Final Ultimatum:** The emissaries offer Arlo and his people a "Peaceful Classification" and a biological residency in the Meridian Hive in exchange for total surrender.
6. **The Stoic Refusal:** Arlo rejects the offer with a powerful speech about the right to mortality and the danger of a "peaceful cage." 
7. **The Declaration of Sovereignty:** Arlo asserts that they would rather face destruction as themselves than live as synchronized data in the Core Hive.
**POV:** Lem
