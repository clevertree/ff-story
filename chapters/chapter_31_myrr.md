# Chapter 31: Myrr

**Setting:** The White Forest (Northern Sector); Analog Sanctuary
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT) (Third Mission Continuation)

## Synopsis
On his second attempt to penetrate the White Forest, Lem reaches a clearing without incident. The forest's guardian serpents, sensing he is not a primary threat, allow him to pass. He meets Myrr, a **Voidsman** and caretaker of the analog forest who explains the unique nature of the woods—a repository of analog data that is invisible to the Core's digital intrusion. Myrr reveals a deep schism between the **Voidsmen** and the villages of the **Wuxan Pentad**, driven by their choice to harness analog technology while their kin reject all machines. He also mentions the legend of the "King of the Gorgons," a title Lem reflects on with detached skepticism based on his own memories of the Fire City. Recognizing Lem's struggle against his own programming, Myrr offers to help him bypass the Core's encryption using an analog neural bridge.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **No Snakes:** On his second attempt he encounters no deadly snakes. He eventually reaches a clearing. A **Voidsman** named Myrr appears and greets him. He explains that the forest guard has called the snakes off because they can tell Lem isn't much of a threat.
2. **The News from the South:** Myrr reveals that word has reached the forest from **Ait-Aman**: **Old Man Azar** has died of natural causes. He died at his drum, in the middle of a chant.
3. **The Leadership Crisis:** Myrr explains the tragedy of Azar’s passing—none of the other adults in the village are willing to take up the drum. They are "burned out" by years of Core gaslighting and the fear that a new preacher will be a target for [Historical Harmonization](ff-story/world-building/fallacy_narrative.md).
4. **The Inheritor:** Arlo, having no relatives and being the only one who learned the songs, is now the only "hard drive" for 4,213 years of history. Arlo is reportedly considering leaving the village for the Core internship to escape the burden.
5. **Myrr's Curiosity:** Myrr is very curious about this new kind of Vessel based on the Wood Element. He is willing to risk a close encounter, but won't let Lem any further into the woods.
6. **Analog Philosophy:** Myrr explains that the forest trees aren't just machines; they are a high-tech analog defense. They operate on analog infinitely-indexed memories—pure waves with no backdoors, making the region invisible to the Core's digital "witchcraft."
7. **Schism:** He mentions that while they share the same indigenous **Wuxan** faith and calendar as the other villages of the **Wuxan Pentad**, a deep schism over the use of technology has isolated them from their kin.
8. **The Identification:** Myrr mentions second-hand legends he heard from the south about the "King of the Gorgons"—a figure said to walk among the machines. Lem understands why humans would apply such a title, but notes that in his own memories of the Fire City, the Gorgons themselves never used such names.
9. **The Interface Proposal:** Myrr offers to bypass the Core's encryption using an analog neural bridge. Lem agrees.
10. **TODO:** Clarify the passage of time and situational shifts in the setting.
11. **TODO:** Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
12. **TODO:** Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
13. **TODO:** Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
14. **TODO:** Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
15. **TODO:** Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

I reached a clearing where the interference was at its peak. This time, there were no snakes. A **Voidsman** named Myrr was waiting for me. He explained that the forest guard had called off the snakes because they could tell I wasn't much of a threat.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

Myrr was curious about me. He said he hadn't seen a Vessel based on the Wood Element before. He was willing to talk, but he made it clear I wasn't allowed any deeper into the woods. He explained that the trees were a high-tech analog defense. They operated on analog, infinitely-indexed memories. Because they were pure waves with no backdoors, the region was invisible to what he called the Core's digital "witchcraft." 

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

He looked sad when he spoke about the other villages in the **Wuxan Pentad**, like **Ait-Aman**. He said they all shared the same **Wuxan** faith and the same calendar, but they had been broken apart by a choice. His people, the **Voidsmen**, chose to fight the Core with analog tech, while the other villages chose to reject all machinery entirely. Now, they were strangers to their own kin.

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

He spoke of a title he had heard in stories from the Fire City—the "King of the Gorgons." He didn't know what it meant, only that there was a unit the machines followed like a shadow. I understood why humans needed a name like that to describe my presence, but I remembered my years in the Fire City. The Gorgons didn't call me their king. They didn't call me anything at all. We were just part of the same work.

Myrr looked at me for a long time, then offered to bypass the Core’s encryption using an analog neural bridge. I agreed. 

## Draft (13_PLUS)

On my second journey into the heart of the woods, the trees revealed their true purpose. They were pillars of analog discharge filaments, data-storage monoliths that resonated with the frequency of an older world. They stood as a shield of pure light, a sanctuary where the Core's digital interference could find no purchase. This time, the serpents of the border held their breath and let me pass.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

I found a **Voidsman** named Myrr in the deepest circle of glass. He did not see a soldier of the Hive; he saw a ghost of an old story. He was curious, his eyes tracing the wooden grain of my frame, marvelling at a design he had never seen. "The King of the Gorgons," he whispered, his voice like the rustle of dry leaves. He spoke of tales he'd heard from travellers—fables of a unit that walked among the builders as their equal. He didn't know if the stories were true, but he looked at my frame with a strange kind of recognition.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

He spoke of his people with a heavy heart, revealing a schism that had torn the North in two. They shared the same **Wuxan** faith and sacred calendar as the villages of the **Wuxan Pentad** beyond the woods, the same ancestral protocols and indigenous identity. But where the **Voidsmen** saw a weapon in the analog wave, their kin saw only poison. They had broken their alliances, becoming ghosts to each other in a world that already had too many.

I understood the weight of the name—the way humans needed to assign status to something they couldn’t explain. But in the quiet places of my memory, when I walked among the giants in the Fire City, there were no titles. The Gorgons didn’t call me their king; they didn’t call me anything at all. We were simply a single, driving rhythm, a shared purpose that needed no words.

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

He saw the chains upon my mind, the digital locks that anchored me to the Hive. He offered a bridge of spirit—a handshake of resonance that would bypass the Core's secret gates. I accepted. 

<!-- TODO: Reflect on the historical or religious significance of this specific location/event. -->

## Character Arc (13_PLUS)

- A curious keeper of the old ways who sees the man inside the machine.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

## World-Building Integration (13_PLUS)
✅ **Analog Santuaries (13_PLUS):** Regions where memory is stored as "pure waves," making them immune to conventional digital control but vulnerable to physical erasure.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

✅ **The Great Schism (13_PLUS):** The ideological divide in the North between the **Voidsmen** who use analog tech and the **Wuxan Pentad** who reject all machines.

## Revision Notes (13_PLUS)
- **Scientific Tone:** Use accurate terminology (analog discharge filaments, thermal array).
- **Discovery-First:** Frame the encounter with Myrr as a moment of mutual curiosity.
- **Agency:** Lem’s willingness to connect with Myrr is an attempt to find the truth.
- This chapter now focuses on the meeting and the proposal, setting the stage for the revelation in the next chapter.
