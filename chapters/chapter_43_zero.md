# Chapter 43: Zero

**Setting:** Cradle Zero ; The Desert Base
**Timeline:** Year 1024 (Year 24 AT - The Surface Climax)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Journey to the Grave:** Lem travels to the desert facility with Ku. He finds the perimeter littered with shells and the scrap of the machine armies.
2. **The Blasted Threshold:** By the time Lem arrives at Cradle Zero, the heavy iron gates have already been ripped off their hinges and the entrances blown open by the swarm.
3. **The Interior Ruin:** Lem enters the base. Much of the high-security interior has been destroyed—melted corridors, shattered labs, and the "Witch Maya" residues from a battle he did not see.
4. **The Descent to the Core:** Following the sounds of echoing thunder, Lem descends into the base’s radioactive primary core. 
5. **The Duel in the Deep:** Lem finds Maya and Rahu in the center of the core. Maya is a shaggy, flickering manifestation of silver daggers. Rahu fights to protect the remaining base staff who are trapped behind sealed doors and to prevent Maya from reaching the Lunar Shuttle controls.
6. **Overwhelming the Mirror:** Rahu is overwhelmed by the multiplicity of Mayas. He vanishes in a final, thermal shockwave as his core integrity is breached by the sync-metal swarm. 
7. **The Final Dissolution:** Maya stares at the remaining base staff hiding behind a sealed observation room. Her eyes flare with revenge, but she takes no further action; her form crystallizes into brittle shards and shatters and she is never seen again.

## Synopsis
Following the global network collapse that has severed all digital records, Lem and Ku travel to the desert base to find the truth beyond the screen. They arrive at Cradle Zero—the facility reduced to a ruin of melted metal and shattered glass. Lem descends into the base’s radioactive primary core to witness the final duel between Maya and Rahu, the Mirror Vessel. Rahu is eventually overwhelmed by the relentless silver swarm. Following the termination of the Core’s last terrestrial protectors, Maya’s form shatters.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I did not wait for further word from the forest. I traveled to the desert base with a tactical commander named Ku. We found the facility in a state of physical ruin. Many people call it "Physical Zero." The giant iron doors had been torn off their hinges. The air smelled of burnt wires and melted glass. I followed the sound of heavy thudding deep into the earth, down to the base's radioactive core. I did not know then that the entire network was about to go dark. Maya was a flickering shape of silver knives, strike after strike against General Rahu. He was the last one defending the shuttle controls. He put up a fight, but there were too many of her. He disappeared in a final flash of heat when the swarm pushed through.

Maya stood still for a long time. She looked at the staff hiding behind the glass in the observation room. She did not hurt them. Instead, her body turned into blue glass and shattered into a thousand pieces.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
I did not wait. I headed for the desert with Ku. By the time we reached the gates, the walls had already been breached. The massive iron doors had been ripped from their hinges, and the entrance was nothing but scorched metal and melted glass. I followed the sound of crashing metal deep into the earth, down to the very heart of the base. That's where I found the last duel. Maya was a flickering blur, her form shifting as she struck with silver hands. General Rahu was the last guardian left. He fought with a cold, steady hand, but he was one man trying to stop a flood. He was swallowed by the swarm, his final defense breaking in a roar of fire.

Maya stood among the ruins, her silver eyes reflecting the end of the base. Then, she turned to blue glass and vanished into the wind. Her work was finished.
