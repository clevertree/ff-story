# Chapter 27: The White Forest Mission

## Synopsis
Reawakening in the Cradle for Mission 4. Lem is consumed by an electronic snake and begins the "grinding" path through the White Forest. This chapter consolidates the infiltration and the repetitive nature of the mission.

## Key Beats
- Awakening and infiltration briefing.
- The encounter with the "Electronic Snake" – a literal and metaphorical consumption.
- The anomaly of perfect-recall reincarnation; Lem starts retaining too much.
- The psychological toll of multiple "short" deployments in the dense white woods.
