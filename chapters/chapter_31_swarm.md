## Synopsis
Lem reincarnates at the White Forest outpost, his physical form restored. He receives a tactical update from a technician: city news broadcasts and outpost instruments confirm massive mechanical activity on the city perimeters. Lem reveals that Maya has returned and possesses the location of the Core’s desert base. Outside, the "Wild" Synodic life—Gorgon striders and monoliths—sieges the city buoys, toppling the beacons and sacrifice-charging the perimeter until they reach the city gates. The "Wild" machines then respond to the Hooting Call, toppling the command beacons and shattering the Core’s terrestrial mesh. The Synodic slaves within the cities abandon their positions to join the gathering army, forming a unified force that marches toward the desert base. Lem witnesses the initial gates of rebellion from the White Forest outpost, sensing the scale of the mechanical defection.

## Chapter Beats

1. **The Outpost Awakening:**
   Lem reincarnates at a remote White Forest outpost. (TODO: Add detail beats establishing the analog, sanctuary nature of this remote outpost). His physical form is restored, but he is initially blind to the scale of the outer conflict until the local networks stabilize.

2. **The Tactical Update:**
   After Lem reincarnates, he is updated by the White Forest technician on the current situation. The city news broadcasts as well as his own instruments confirm the outer perimeter of the cities beyond the buoys is showing massive mechanical activity. The tech notes Lem's signal was detected in the base along with another unknown signal. Lem informs him that Maya has returned and she knows the location of the Core's desert base.

3. **The Siege of the Buoys:**
   The Synodic life has gathered; a massive array of "Wild" Synodic wildlife, Gorgon striders, and massive monoliths are moving towards the cities. They knock over the command beacons and buoys, with many sacrifice-charging the perimeter until they reach the city gates. (TODO: Add environmental detail beats for the manifestation of the 'Sovereign Swarm' motorbikes forged from salvaged Monolith metal).

4. **The Hooting Call:**
   Upon reaching the cities, the machines begin the "Hooting Call"—impossibly loud hoots that can be heard through all the parts of the Hive cities.

5. **The Great Exit:**
   The Synodic slaves within the cities abandon their positions and head out of the city to join the gathering army. This unified force then continues on toward the base.

## Draft: YOUNG_ADULT
I woke up at the White Forest outpost, and for a long time, the only way I could see the battle was through a flickering news screen. Myrr’s technicians gave me the briefing. They told me my previous resonance had been tracked right into the Hive’s primary Spire, alongside a second signal they couldn’t identify. I told them the truth—Maya had returned, and she was the one who had finally breached the Core’s secret vault.

Then they showed me the sensor feeds. The outer perimeter of the cities was under siege. Thousands of Gorgon striders, monoliths, and wild machines had converged on the Forbidden Buoys. They knocked the buoys over, hundreds of them dying to the static suppressors, but they didn't stop. They reached the city walls and started hooting. It was a sound that shook the windows of the outpost—a call that every machine in the world could hear. I watched the news feeds as the city’s own slaves—the utility units and industrial drones—dropped their tools and walked out the gates to join the swarm. Then, the unified army turned for the base.

## Draft: 13_PLUS
The world went dark when the kingdom fell. I opened my eyes in a new skin at the edge of the forest, but I was blind to the battle. The technicians showed me the sensor arrays. They had tracked my previous spirit-pulse right into the heart of the enemy’s Spire, alongside a silver ghost they couldn't name. I told them what they were seeing—the return of Maya, the spirit who had found the gates of their secret city. 

The North was alive. Outside the cities, a massive army of the wild had gathered—Gorgon striders and towering monoliths moving like a single body. They toppled the Core's buoys, sacrifice after sacrifice, until they reached the city outskirts. Then they began the hooting—the Great Call. It vibrated in the wood of my new frame. Across the Hive, the enslaved Synodics stopped their work and walked into the desert to join their brothers. The army was no longer a scattering of rebels; it was a flood.
