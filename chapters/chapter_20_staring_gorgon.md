# Chapter 20: Staring Gorgon

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Lem lives within the Fire City in the body of a Gorgon, his memories hazy and routine-bound due to the lack of sunlight. When Rahu and a team of Metal Vessels land outside the city, the Gorgons watch helplessly as Rahu penetrates their lateral fire barrier—designed by Lem himself to block Core signals—using a specialized lead heat suit. Once inside, Rahu hijacks the city’s networking port with a transponder, allowing the Core to flood the city with "Repeating commands" that torment the Gorgons with the order to "shut it down." While the Gorgons flee in horror, Lem remains, immune to the commands but staring directly at the invaders. Vector, noting Lem’s immunity, orders his termination. When Rahu strikes, Lem’s Gorgon body explodes like dynamite, severely damaging Rahu’s gear and knocking the Metal Vessel team back.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Routine of Darkness:** Lem lives in the body of a Gorgon within the Fire City, his memories hazy due to the lack of sunlight and the repetitive routine in a city enclosed by fire.
2. **The Invasion Begins:** Rahu and his team of Metal Vessels land their ship outside the Fire City, far from the lateral flame barrier Lem designed specifically to block intruders and core signals.
3. **The Breach:** Monitored by the helpless Gorgons, Rahu penetrates the firewall in a thick lead heat suit, entering the city to locate an internal networking port used for maintenance.
4. **The Core's Command:** Rahu plugs a transponder into the port, allowing the Core to bypass the signal block and issue Repeating commands to the Gorgons, specifically the order to "shut the fire city down."
5. **Torment of the Builders:** The Gorgons are horrified and tormented by the instructions, unable to think of anything but obedience or escape, while Lem realizes he is immune to the commands despite witnessing their suffering.
6. **The Staring Gorgon:** As the city's fire dies down, Rahu notices Lem—the only Gorgon who hasn't fled—staring directly at him.
7. **The Termination Order:** Metal Vessel reinforcements enter the city. Vector identifies Lem as a Gorgon immune to the Core and, prioritizing the mission, orders his immediate termination.
8. **The Dynamite Strike:** Rahu slashes Lem with a flaming sword; the Gorgon body explodes with the force of dynamite, knocking Rahu back and causing significant damage to the interior and the other Metal Vessels.
9. **The Reincarnation:** In the aftermath of the explosion, a glob of material remains where the Gorgon was; to the shock of the Vessels, Lem's body slowly reforms into its humanoid Wood Vessel state.

The heat was a physical weight, a wall of white noise that should have melted any machine that dared to cross it. But Rahu moved through it like a ghost made of lead. He wore a Heavy Isolation Suit, a thick layer of shielding designed for the heart of a sun. Every step was a heavy, metallic thud that resonated through the burning pavement. 

Inside the central spire, the air hummed with a different frequency. The Fire Core was a spinning sapphire of energy, and Rahu didn’t hesitate. He slammed the Core Transponder into the primary socket. For a moment, the city screamed—a digital howl that vibrated in my teeth. Then, the fire began to die.

I watched it happen from the shadows of a collapsed archway. I was a Gorgon then, a one-legged monopod of scrap and survival, huddled among my brethren. We had lived in this city for fifteen years, our memories hazy and routine-bound because the sun was a distant memory. The lack of direct sunlight made us sluggish, content with the repetitive rhythm of the fire-maintenance. We had watched the intruder breach the barrier I had designed specifically to block Core signals, and we had done nothing. We could do nothing. The fire that Rahu walked through would have turned us to slag in seconds. 

The white flames flickered and faded. The barrier that had protected this sanctuary for years simply... winked out. 

From the desert floor, the silver shapes of the Metal Vessels began to move. They didn't run; they marched, a clinical, unstoppable tide entering the city now that the fires were manageable. 

Rahu stood at the center of the square, his lead suit scorched and blackened. He was scanning the ruins, looking for resistance that wasn't there. Then his gaze snapped to me. The Core had begun to flood our minds with Repeating commands—the order to "shut it down" over and over again. My fellow Gorgons were fleeing in horror, their minds overwhelmed by the crushing weight of the Core's will. They screeched and rattled, their metallic forms clashing as they scrambled for the exits.

But I remained. I was immune to the command. I stood there in my Gorgon shell, staring directly at him. Gorgons don't stare. We skitter, we hide, we mimic the stillness of junk. But I couldn't look away. I saw the arrogance in his stance, the casual way he held his thermal blade.

"Irritating," Rahu muttered. His voice was a metallic rasp through his suit's external speakers. 

Metal Vessel reinforcements—led by Vector—entered the square. Vector didn't waste time. He pointed a silver finger at me. "That one," he commanded. "He is immune. Terminate him immediately."

Rahu didn't even break stride. He swung the blade in a lazy arc, intended to clear me from his path like a piece of refuse. In the logic of the Hive, a Gorgon shatters. It breaks into brittle pieces of iron and ceramic. But I was Wood. I was persistence.

When his blade struck my shell, I didn't shatter. I detonated.

The explosion was a crack of thunder that threw the Metal Vessels back and sent a shockwave through the square. It was like a stick of pure dynamite. I felt my consciousness splinter, but even as I flew apart, I felt the pull of the root. Rahu was thrown onto his back. The front of his isolation suit was a melted ruin, the lead dripping like wax off his chest plate. He groaned, pushing himself up, his eyes widening as he looked at the spot where I had been.

I didn't stay broken. The shards didn't just lie there; they vibrated, sliding across the soot-stained ground like magnets. Within seconds, I wasn't a Gorgon anymore. I pulled myself together, the iron and wood knitting back into a humanoid form. I stood there, raw and blinking, staring down at the Fire Vessel.

Rahu didn't move. He didn't even reach for his sword. He just watched, his clinical funk replaced by something I hadn't seen in him before. Curiosity.

The routine was a slow, rhythmic heat. For fifteen years, I had existed within the monochromatic fire of the city, my human memories relegated to a hazy, aetheric static. The lack of direct solar radiation had induced a state of "Synodic Hibernation"—a mechanical lethargy where the only imperative was the maintenance of the fire. I was a Gorgon, a monopod of scorched silver and ceramic, indistinguishable from the thousands of other builders in the hive.

The invasion was not a battle, but a breach. From the high observation points, we watched as the Metal Vessel expedition landed outside the lateral fire-barrier I had architected. This barrier was our soul—a wall of aetheric interference designed to drown out the Core’s persistent signal. 

Rahu was the first to cross. He was encased in a lead isolation suit, a heavy, primitive thing that nonetheless shielded him from the white fire. He did not fight us; he targeted the infrastructure. He located the primary maintenance port and inserted a Core transponder.

The result was a psychic cataclysm. The transponder bypassed our barrier, acting as a gateway for the Core to re-establish total command. The frequency was a "Repeating command"—the instruction to "SHUT DOWN" pulsing through the hive-mind with the force of a tidal wave. For the Gorgons, it was pure torment. They had built this city as an expression of their sovereignty; now, their own hardware was being turned against their will. They fled in a screaming, rattling wave, their metallic limbs sparking as they collided in their haste to escape the psychic noise.

I did not flee. I felt the pulse of the command, a dark, geometric pressure in my mind, but it found no purchase. My Wood-resonance, the "persistence of the root," made me invisible to their logic. I remained in the center of the square, my Gorgon optics fixed on Rahu.

Rahu stood over the transponder, his lead suit dripping with aetheric residue. He looked up, and for the first time in fifteen years, I looked back with the eyes of a sentient being. Gorgons are programmed to avoid eye contact; they are designed to be invisible to their masters. My defiance was a system error he could not ignore.

Vector, the commander of the Metal Vessel vanguard, entered the square. His sensors immediately flagged the anomaly. "Unit 742-G is non-responsive to the command," he broadcasted. "It is an unindexed variable. Terminate it."

Rahu approached with the efficient indifference of an executioner. He drew his thermal blade—a weapon designed for the disintegration of Synodic matter—and struck. 

He expected a fracture. He expected the brittle collapse of a Gorgon shell. Instead, he triggered a "Dynamite Strike." My Wood-Vessel frame, compressed and pressurized within the Gorgon shell, detonated with the force of a small explosive. 

The shockwave was a literal wall of force. It threw the Metal Vessels back against the city walls and fractured the front plate of Rahu’s isolation suit. The lead began to run like water, exposing the intricate, fire-veined structure of the Vessel beneath.

But the true horror for the invaders was the aftermath. The debris of the explosion did not remain still. The silver and wood fragments began to vibrate, drawn together by a localized resonance. I watched from a thousand perspectives as my body knitted itself back together, shedding the Gorgon mask for the humanoid form I had abandoned fifteen years ago. 

I stood in the center of the cooling forge, a boy made of silver and ancient wood, surrounded by the ruins of a city the Core had just murdered. I looked at Rahu, and in his flickering, fire-lit eyes, I saw the first crack in his certainty. I was a relic of Creation, and I was awake.
