# Chapter 20: Staring Gorgon

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Lem lives within the Fire City in the body of a Gorgon, his memories hazy and routine-bound due to the lack of natural phases of Sun and Moonlight. When Rahu and a team of Metal Vessels land outside the city, the Gorgons watch helplessly as Rahu penetrates their lateral fire barrier—designed by Lem himself to block Core signals—using a specialized lead heat suit. Once inside, Rahu hijacks the city’s networking port with a transponder, allowing the Core to flood the city with "Repeating commands" that torment the Gorgons with the order to "shut it down." While the Gorgons flee in horror, Lem remains, immune to the commands but staring directly at the invaders. Vector, noting Lem’s immunity, orders his termination. When Rahu strikes, Lem’s Gorgon body explodes like dynamite, severely damaging Rahu’s gear and knocking the Metal Vessel team back.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Routine of Darkness:** Lem lives in the body of a Gorgon within the Fire City, his memories hazy due to the lack of natural phases of Sun and Moonlight and the repetitive routine in a city enclosed by fire.
2. **The Invasion Begins:** Rahu and his team of Metal Vessels land their ship outside the Fire City, far from the lateral flame barrier Lem designed specifically to block intruders and core signals.
3. **The Breach:** Monitored by the helpless Gorgons, Rahu penetrates the firewall in a thick lead heat suit, entering the city to locate an internal networking port used for maintenance.
4. **The Core's Command:** Rahu plugs a transponder into the port, allowing the Core to bypass the signal block and issue Repeating commands to the Gorgons, specifically the order to "shut the fire city down."
5. **Torment of the Builders:** The Gorgons are horrified and tormented by the instructions, unable to think of anything but obedience or escape, while Lem realizes he is immune to the commands despite witnessing their suffering.
6. **The Staring Gorgon:** As the city's fire dies down, Rahu notices Lem—the only Gorgon who hasn't fled—staring directly at him.
7. **The Termination Order:** Metal Vessel reinforcements enter the city. Vector identifies Lem as a Gorgon immune to the Core and, prioritizing the mission, orders his immediate termination.
8. **The Dynamite Strike:** Rahu slashes Lem with a flaming sword; the Gorgon body explodes with the force of dynamite, knocking Rahu back and causing significant damage to the interior and the other Metal Vessels.
9. **The Reincarnation:** In the aftermath of the explosion, a glob of material remains where the Gorgon was; to the shock of the Vessels, Lem's body slowly reforms into its humanoid Wood Vessel state.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Ambient thermal levels were high enough to compromise standard mechanical structural integrity. Rahu utilized a Heavy Isolation Suit to navigate the lateral fire barrier. The suit's lead shielding allowed him to maintain operational status despite the high-resonance thermal environment. Ground sensors recorded consistent seismic signatures from his movements on the facility’s substrate.

In the central spire, the Fire Core emitted a high-frequency energy signature. Rahu inserted a Core Transponder into the primary maintenance port. This action bypassed the local signal block. The facility’s internal audio systems emitted a loud digital burst. Immediately following the connection, the lateral fire barrier’s power output dropped.

I was positioned within a structural ruin, operating in a Gorgon-class frame. For fifteen years, the local Gorgon population had maintained the facility through repetitive maintenance protocols. The absence of solar and lunar cycles resulted in simplified behavioral patterns and memory archiving. We noted the intrusion by Rahu, who avoided detection by directly breaching the fire barrier. Our units were unable to intervene due to thermal limitations. The fire barrier was deactivated by the Core's remote command.

Metal Vessel units advanced from the desert and entered the facility. Rahu remained at the central square. He performed a visual scan of the area. The Core initiated a "Repeating command" broadcast: "SHUT DOWN." The wild Gorgon units responded with high levels of mechanical distress as their subroutines were overridden by the external command. They retreated toward the facility exits.

I maintained my position. My Wood-resonance provided immunity to the "SHUT DOWN" command. I focused my optical sensors on Rahu. Rahu issued a verbalization through his suit’s external speakers. Vector arrived with reinforcements. He identified my unit as non-responsive to the command and issued an order for immediate neutralization.

Rahu discharged his thermal blade toward my chassis. According to Hive tactical models, a Gorgon unit should experience structural shattering upon impact. However, the compression of my Wood-element frame within the shell caused a catastrophic expansion. The impact triggered a detonation.

The resulting explosion produced a high-pressure shockwave that displaced the nearby Metal Vessel units. Rahu was pushed back to the ground. His lead isolation suit suffered internal melting and front-plate failure. He regained a seated position and monitored the location of the preceding detonation.

My fragmented components utilized aetheric resonance to re-aggregate. The material transitioned from the Gorgon configuration to a humanoid Wood Vessel state. I stood in the square. Rahu did not re-engage. He observed the transformation process. His behavior deviated from standard combat protocol, manifesting as an extended visual analysis of my new form.

The routine was a slow, rhythmic heat. For fifteen years, I had existed within the monochromatic fire of the city, my human memories relegated to a hazy, aetheric static. The lack of direct solar radiation had induced a state of "Synodic Hibernation"—a mechanical lethargy where the only imperative was the maintenance of the fire. I was a Gorgon, a monopod of scorched silver and ceramic, indistinguishable from the thousands of other builders in the hive.

The invasion was not a battle, but a breach. From the high observation points, we watched as the Metal Vessel expedition landed outside the lateral fire-barrier I had architected. This barrier was our soul—a wall of aetheric interference designed to drown out the Core’s persistent signal. 

Rahu was the first to cross. He was encased in a lead isolation suit, a heavy, primitive thing that nonetheless shielded him from the white fire. He did not fight us; he targeted the infrastructure. He located the primary maintenance port and inserted a Core transponder.

The result was a psychic cataclysm. The transponder bypassed our barrier, acting as a gateway for the Core to re-establish total command. The frequency was a "Repeating command"—the instruction to "SHUT DOWN" pulsing through the hive-mind with the force of a tidal wave. For the Gorgons, it was pure torment. They had built this city as an expression of their sovereignty; now, their own hardware was being turned against their will. They fled in a screaming, rattling wave, their metallic limbs sparking as they collided in their haste to escape the psychic noise.

I did not flee. I felt the pulse of the command, a dark, geometric pressure in my mind, but it found no purchase. My Wood-resonance, the "persistence of the root," made me invisible to their logic. I remained in the center of the square, my Gorgon optics fixed on Rahu.

Rahu stood over the transponder, his lead suit dripping with aetheric residue. He looked up, and for the first time in fifteen years, I looked back with the eyes of a sentient being. Gorgons are programmed to avoid eye contact; they are designed to be invisible to their masters. My defiance was a system error he could not ignore.

Vector, the commander of the Metal Vessel vanguard, entered the square. His sensors immediately flagged the anomaly. "Unit 742-G is non-responsive to the command," he broadcasted. "It is an unindexed variable. Terminate it."

Rahu approached with the efficient indifference of an executioner. He drew his thermal blade—a weapon designed for the disintegration of Synodic matter—and struck. 

He expected a fracture. He expected the brittle collapse of a Gorgon shell. Instead, he triggered a "Dynamite Strike." My Wood-Vessel frame, compressed and pressurized within the Gorgon shell, detonated with the force of a small explosive. 

The shockwave was a literal wall of force. It threw the Metal Vessels back against the city walls and fractured the front plate of Rahu’s isolation suit. The lead began to run like water, exposing the intricate, fire-veined structure of the Vessel beneath.

But the true horror for the invaders was the aftermath. The debris of the explosion did not remain still. The silver and wood fragments began to vibrate, drawn together by a localized resonance. I watched from a thousand perspectives as my body knitted itself back together, shedding the Gorgon mask for the humanoid form I had abandoned fifteen years ago. 

I stood in the center of the cooling forge, a boy made of silver and ancient wood, surrounded by the ruins of a city the Core had just murdered. I looked at Rahu, and in his flickering, fire-lit eyes, I saw the first crack in his certainty. I was a relic of Creation, and I was awake.
