# Chapter 30: The White Forest Briefing

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Core Command Hub - "New Horizon"

---

## Outline / Summary

Lem stands at the height of his acclaim. In the shining streets of **New Horizon**, he is a celebrity—a "Vessel of Choice." However, the atmosphere inside the Command Hub is anything but celebratory.

Lia Vane and the Archivist Council present him with his most dangerous task yet: **Mission 4**. He is shown satellite imagery of a massive, glowing white patch in the northern forests. It is the **White Forest**, an artificial construct that has swallowed every Core reconnaissance team sent into its depths.

The briefing is grim. Lia reveals that dozens of Metal Vessels have vanished here. Not just destroyed, but *erased*. Their telemetry beacons—usually providing real-time data back to Cradle Zero—cut out the moment they crossed the "White Line." The Core is blind. They don't know if the forest is a weapon, a shield, or a city.

Because Lem is a Wood Vessel, the Core believes he has an innate "harmonic resonance" with the artificial trees. They hope he can "listen" to the forest where the Metal units could only try to "read" it. Lem accepts, but he realizes the truth: he is being sent where the perfect soldiers were lost. He is the Core's last, most desperate sensor.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Wary and isolated. He sees through the "hero" reward system and understands that he is being sent on a suicide mission.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Hearing the truth about the missing Metal Vessels.
    2. Realizing the limitations of Core technology (the "Void" of the forest).
    3. The internal decision: if he disappears in the forest, he might finally be free of the Core's link.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **The White Forest:** Its appearance and signal-jamming properties.
✅ **The "Void":** The absence of Aetheric telemetry.
✅ **Wood Resonance:** Why Lem's specific element is deemed superior for this infiltration.

## Notes & Spoilers

- **Internal Spoiler:** The forest is a "Spirit Port" or a nursery for a new type of Synodic life that the Core cannot acknowledge.
