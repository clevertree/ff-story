# Chapter 30: The White Forest Briefing

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Core Command Hub - "New Horizon"

---

## Outline / Summary

The Core is concerned by Lem's "objective observations" and his challenging questions—to the point that he is starting to affect Cassia. To keep them both focused and prevent a breakdown like Rahu's, the Core devises **Mission 4**.

The briefing is different this time. There is no large crew of Metal Vessels. The objective is to infiltrate the **White Forest**—a shimmering ecosystem of electronic trees. The Core tells Cassia that the mission parameters are up to her: communicate with the inhabitants, protect Lem, and ensure they pose no perceived threat.

Cassia, putting her doubts aside, tells Lem she'll be with him all the way—even after his death, she has his back. Lem hears the "ambassador" narrative but realizes the Core is throwing him at an objective they can't control. He is deployed on his most mysterious mission yet.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Focused and wary. He recognizes the "grinding" nature of this deployment but values Cassia's sincerity.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Noticing the lack of Metal Vessel support for the first time.
    2. Hearing Cassia's promise of protection beyond death.
    3. The deployment on the border of the shimmering, energy-filled forest.

### Cassia Vane
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Challenged by Lem's previous questions but refocusing on the mission. She is becoming an advocate for Lem's "different" nature.
- **Status:** Idealistic and Protective. She genuinely believes the mission is about harmony and rebuilding. She views Lem's "questioning" in the north as a sign of his unique spirit, not a defect, and is determined to see him succeed.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Embassadorship Narrative:** The Core's benevolent excuse for the infiltration.
✅ **The "Void":** The signal-jamming properties of the White Forest that Cassia underestimates.
✅ **Wood Resonance:** Lem's specific utility for "harmonizing" with the forest.
✅ **Vessel Imperfection:** The Council's hidden reason for Lem's solo deployment vs. Cassia's belief in his potential.

## Notes & Spoilers

- **Internal Spoiler:** Cassia is unaware that the Council has disabled the Re-creation Protocol's telemetry for this sector. She believes she is sending him on a difficult diplomatic mission; the Council knows they are sending him into a data tomb.
