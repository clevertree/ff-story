# Chapter 31: The Electronic Snake

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** The White Forest Perimeter

---

## Outline / Summary

Lem ventures into the shimmering White Forest. Cassia is in his ear, her voice a comforting tether—until it isn't. "I'm losing signal," she reports, as expected. Lem is alone in the eerie silence.

The rustling starts in the distant trees, getting closer and louder. A movement becomes an unmistakable threat: a massive electronic snake plows through the forest. Before Lem can even raise a weapon, the entity consumes him whole.

Lem wakes up in the incubation chamber at the desert base. To Cassia's shock, he has reincarnated almost instantly. She notes his unprecedented speed and asks for his report. Lem provides a high-detail account of the snake and the moment of his death.

Cassia is deeply confused; other Vessels' memories are vague and unassociated. Lem's memory is concrete, as if he didn't die at all. An Archivist officer enters, asking passive-aggressively if Lem is ready for redeployment. Cassia, stumped by the situation, orders him back to the forest.
