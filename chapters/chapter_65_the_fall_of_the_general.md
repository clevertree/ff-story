## Chapter Outline

1. **The Siege:** The desert base is under lock-down. The Archivist media machine shows Maya appearing as multiple apparitions leading the speeder bike assault.
2. **The Encounter:** General Tor stands alone at the main entrance, wielding a colossal suppressor gun.
3. **The Duel:** Maya’s primary bike breaches the perimeter; she launches into a physical confrontation with Tor.
4. **The Termination:** Maya strikes through Tor's chest with a refined metal sword. Tor disintegrates into ash, ending the age of the Earth Vessel.
5. **The Blackout:** Following Tor's fall, all transmissions from the city cease. The electrical grid fails, and the city goes dark, indicating the loss of Core control over the network.
6. **The Escalation:** The transmission blackout prompts Lem into immediate action. He realizes the base entrance is now vulnerable.
7. **The Breach:** Lem and the White Forest crew launch across the desert, entering the smoldering ruins of the base.
8. **The Final Sight:** Lem reaches the observation gallery to witness Rahu battling swarms of Maya apparitions. Rahu is overwhelmed and explodes in a thermal shockwave.
9. **The Aftermath:** Maya vanishes into dark dust, leaving the survivors in a hollow, silent base.
