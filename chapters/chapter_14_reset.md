# Chapter 14: Reset

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus)
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Rahu lies neutralized in a stasis field as the Lem-Lynn hybrid separates. Despite the military's desperate attempts to stop her, the unstable form that was once Lynn reaches the pyramid's central pillar of light. As she enters the energy column, the global reset is triggered, marking the start of the Great Fry.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Stasis Field:** Rahu remains paralyzed on the floor, his heat extinguished by the stasis field. Lem watches from a dream-like state as he hears Lynn's voice announcing final steps.
2. **Separation:** Lem feels a strange, pulling sensation as his consciousness seems to split and return to a single focus.
3. **Unstable State:** He hears Lynn's voice in his head, noting that her current state is unstable but sufficient for her goal.
4. **Initiation:** Lynn announces the start of the "Reset." Lem snaps out of his dream state and returns to his physical body.
5. **Shock:** Lem sees a shocked Iris staring at the unstable, flowing mass of what was once Lynn—now a shifting, metallic apparition that seems to be struggling to retain a human shape. Iris asks, "What are you?"
6. **The Column:** The figure ignores Iris and walks towards the center pillar of light.
7. **Stasis:** Iris yells "Stop!" but the figure continues. She orders "stasis," but the electrical arcs seem to pass right through the shifting form.
8. **Shells:** Iris yells "Shells!" and the soldiers switch to explosive rounds. The impacts shatter the apparition into a swirl of metallic shards.
9. **The Vortex:** The pieces continue to gather toward the pillar of light as soldiers watch helplessly. The shards of metal fly into the air in a vortex and merge with the energy.
10. **The Great Fry:** The pillar of light intensifies, the pyramid vibrates, and the sky outside ignites with energy. The global reset—the Great Fry—has begun.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Rahu lay collapsed on the stone floor, his flaming sword extinguished, his body pinned by the heavy purple arcs of the stasis field. He didn't move; he stayed entirely still. I was still watching from a dream-like state, my mind floating through the echoes of the room. Lynn’s voice was a sequence of cold commands echoing in my head.

"Recombine," she said.

I felt a pulling sensation, as if my very soul was being stretched and then snapped back together. 

"Separation," she added.

Then I felt a sudden detachment. I was being pushed out, my focus returning to a single point. I heard Lynn remarking to herself—her voice still clinical—that her own form was becoming unstable. But then she noted it appeared stable enough for the next step.

"Initiation: Reset," she announced.

The dream world vanished. I snapped back into my own skin, my boots hitting the hard floor of the pyramid. I stumbled, gasping for air. 

Iris Novak was staring at the thing that had been Lynn. It wasn't a girl anymore. It was an unstable, flowing mass of what looked like tiny metal spheres and shards that shimmered like mercury. It didn't have a face, just a rough, shifting shape that mimicked a human form. 

"What... what are you?" Iris whispered, her voice shaking for the first time.

The thing didn't answer. It turned toward the center of the room, looking at the pillar of light that shot up from the floor. It began to walk.

"Stop!" Iris yelled, her authority returning in a burst of panic. "I said stop!"

The Lynn-thing didn't stop. It didn't even slow down.

"Stasis!" Iris screamed.

The soldiers fired. Arcs of electricity and plasma tore through the air, but they didn't hit the figure. They seemed to slide around it, passing through the gaps in its shifting form as if it wasn't really there.

"Shells!" Iris roared. "Fire!"

The soldiers switched their weapons. The sound of explosive rounds filled the chamber—deafening, percussive blasts that hit the target dead center. Under the impact, the form didn't bleed. It shattered. Thousands of shards of metal and ceramic sprayed into the air.

But they didn't fall.

The pieces continued to move. They gathered in the air, caught in a magnetic pull and heading toward the pillar of light. The soldiers stood there, their guns hot, unable to do anything to stop the vortex. The shards of metal flew into the energy column, spinning in a brilliant, silver circle.

The pillar of light intensified, growing until it filled the entire chamber. The floor began to vibrate, a deep, bone-shaking hum that signaled the start of the Great Fry. Lynn was gone, and the world was about to change.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

Rahu lay in the center of the Nexus, his thermal signatures extinguished by the high-persistence stasis field. Within the dream-like silence of my mind, I remained a witness to the final sequence. Lynn’s voice broadcasted the next commands directly into my awareness.

"Recombine," she announced.

The manifestations merged into a single, high-density mass of shifting energy. Then, the command for separation followed. I felt the components of my own awareness detach and return to their original structures. Lynn’s voice noted an increase in instability. "Instability detected following detachment," she remarked. "Acceptable parameters for target objective."

"Initiate: Reset," she stated.

The dream-like state collapsed. I was returned to my physical body, gasping as the heavy air of the chamber hit my lungs. I looked up to see Iris Novak standing paralyzed with shock. She was staring at the entity that had been Lynn—now a shifting, non-euclidean mass of sub-millimeter metallic spheres and fragmented plates.

"What are you?" Iris demanded, her voice betraying a rare fracture in her military composure.

The figure offered no response. It oriented itself toward the primary energy column at the pyramid's apex and began its advance. 

"Stop!" Iris yelled, her hand reaching for her sidearm. The figure continued its path, undisturbed by the ultimatum. "Stasis! Secure the asset!"

The squad deployed their containment cannons. Arcing lines of plasma and high-voltage electricity converged on the figure, but the energy failed to find a ground. The arcs bent around the shifting mass, as if diverted by a powerful field. 

"Shells!" Iris commanded. "Fragment the target!"

The soldiers switched to explosive kinetic rounds. The chamber erupted with the thunder of rapid-fire discharges. The rounds hit the target with devastating force. It didn't resist the kinetic energy; it shattered. Thousands of shards were thrown into the air by the secondary explosions.

But the objective was already fulfilled.

The fragments didn't settle. Caught in the intensifying draw of the central pillar, they swarmed into the light, forming a shimmering metallic vortex. The soldiers watched in a heavy, helpless silence as the shards merged with the energy column.

The pillar of light expanded, its luminosity blinding. The pyramid began to vibrate at a frequency that rattled the stone beneath my feet. High-energy signatures flared in the sky outside the structure. The "Great Fry"—the global aetheric reset—had officially transitioned from expectation to reality.
