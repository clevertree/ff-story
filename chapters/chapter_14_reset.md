# Chapter 14: Reset

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus)
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Rahu lies neutralized in a stasis field as the Lem-Lynn hybrid separates. Despite the military's desperate attempts to stop her, the unstable Water Vessel that was once Lynn reaches the pyramid's central pillar of light. As she enters the energy column, the global reset is triggered, marking the start of the Great Fry.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Stasis Field:** Rahu remains paralyzed on the floor, his heat extinguished by the stasis field. Lem watches from the dreamscape as Lynn announces script executions: "Recombine" and "Dehybridization."
2. **Separation:** Lem watches as the three humanoid figures join into a large mass and then separate again.
3. **Unstable Resonance:** Lynn remarks that the recombined Water Vessel has become unstable with the loss of the Wood Vessel, though she notes it is stable enough for the objective.
4. **Initiation:** Lynn initiates playback of the Reset Protocol. Lem snaps out of his dreamscape and returns to his physical body.
5. **Shock:** Lem sees a shocked Iris staring at the unstable, flowing mass of tiny metal balls and fragments that was once Lynn. The humanoid seems to be struggling to retain shape. Iris asks, "What are you?"
6. **The Column:** It ignores Iris turns and walks towards the center pillar of light.
7. **Stasis:** Iris yells "Stop!" but the humanoid continues. She orders "stasis" and "shells," but the electrical arcs pass through and the explosive rounds shatter the form into a swirl of shards.
8. **Shells:** Iris yells "Shells!" and the soldiers switch modes and fire projectiles. The explosive rounds hit the target and shatter the apparition into a swirl of titanium shards.
9. **The Vortex:** The pieces continue to gather toward the pillar of light as soldiers watch helplessly. The shards of metal fly into the air in a vortex and merge with the energy.
10. **The Great Fry:** The pillar of light intensifies, the pyramid vibrates, and the sky outside ignites with energy. The global reset—the Great Fry—has begun.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Rahu lay collapsed on the stone floor, his flaming sword extinguished, his body pinned by the heavy purple arcs of the stasis field. He didn't move; he stayed entirely still. I was still watching from the dreamscape, my mind floating through the data of the room. Lynn’s voice was a sequence of cold commands echoing in my head.

"Recombine," she said.

I watched as the two vine-covered humanoids I had become pulled together, merging into one massive, dark shape. 

"Dehybridization," she added.

Then the mass split again, but it wasn't equal. I felt myself being pushed out, my human form returning as the wood elements detached from the metal. Lynn remarked to herself—her voice still clinical—that the Water Vessel was becoming unstable without the wood to anchor it. But then she noted it appeared stable enough for the next step.

"Initiation: Reset Protocol," she announced.

The dream world vanished. I snapped back into my own skin, my boots hitting the hard floor of the pyramid. I stumbled, gasping for air. 

Iris Novak was staring at the thing that had been Lynn. It wasn't a girl anymore. It was an unstable, flowing mass of tiny metal balls and shards that shimmered like mercury. It didn't have a face, just a rough, shifting shape that mimicked a human form. 

"What... what are you?" Iris whispered, her voice shaking for the first time.

The thing didn't answer. It turned toward the center of the room, looking at the pillar of light that shot up from the floor. It began to walk.

"Stop!" Iris yelled, her authority returning in a burst of panic. "I said stop!"

The Lynn-thing didn't stop. It didn't even slow down.

"Stasis!" Iris screamed.

The soldiers fired. Arcs of electricity and plasma tore through the air, but they didn't hit the humanoid. They seemed to slide around it, passing through the gaps in its shifting form as if it wasn't really there.

"Shells!" Iris roared. "Fire!"

The soldiers switched their weapons. The sound of explosive rounds filled the chamber—deafening, percussive blasts that hit the humanoid dead center. Under the impact, the form didn't bleed. It shattered. Thousands of shards of metal and ceramic sprayed into the air.

But they didn't fall.

The pieces continued to move. They gathered in the air, caught in a magnetic pull and heading toward the pillar of light. The soldiers stood there, their guns hot, unable to do anything to stop the vortex. The shards of metal flew into the energy column, spinning in a brilliant, silver circle.

The pillar of light intensified, growing until it filled the entire chamber. The floor began to vibrate, a deep, bone-shaking hum that signaled the start of the Great Fry. Lynn was gone, and the world was about to change.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

Rahu lay in the center of the Nexus, his thermal signatures extinguished by the high-persistence stasis field. Within the dreamscape, I remained a silent witness to the finalization of the combat script. Lynn’s internal processor broadcasted the next sequence of commands.

"Recombine," she announced.

The two humanoid manifestations of the hybridization protocol merged into a single, high-density mass. Then, the dehybridization command followed. I watched as the wood-element mass detached from the primary structure. Lynn’s diagnostic voice noted a significant increase in resonance volatility. "Water Vessel instability detected following wood detachment," she remarked. "Instability within acceptable parameters for Objective Zero."

"Playback: Reset Protocol," she stated.

The dreamscape collapsed instantaneously. I was restored to my physical frame, gasping as the aetheric pressure of the chamber hit my lungs. I looked up to see Iris Novak standing paralyzed with shock. She was staring at the entity that had been Lynn—now a shifting, non-euclidean mass of sub-millimeter metallic spheres and fragmented ceramic plates.

"What are you?" Iris demanded, her voice betraying a rare fracture in her military composure.

The humanoid entity offered no response. It oriented itself toward the primary energy column at the pyramid's apex and began its advance. 

"Stop!" Iris yelled, her hand reaching for her sidearm. The entity continued its path, undisturbed by the ultimatum. "Stasis! Secure the asset!"

The squad deployed their containment cannons. Arcing lines of plasma and high-voltage electricity converged on the humanoid, but the energy failed to find a ground. The arcs bent around the shifting mass, as if diverted by a powerful gravitational or magnetic field. 

"Shells!" Iris commanded. "Fragment the target!"

The soldiers switched to explosive kinetic rounds. The chamber erupted with the thunder of rapid-fire discharges. The rounds hit the humanoid with devastating force. It didn't resist the kinetic energy; it shattered. Thousands of shards were thrown into the air by the secondary explosions.

But the objective was already fulfilled.

The fragments didn't settle. Caught in the intensifying draw of the central pillar, they swarmed into the light, forming a shimmering metallic vortex. The soldiers watched in a heavy, helpless silence as the shards merged with the energy column.

The pillar of light expanded, its luminosity surpassing the sensors' ability to compensate. The pyramid began to vibrate at a frequency that rattled the stone beneath my feet. High-energy signatures flared in the sky outside the structure. The "Great Fry"—the global aetheric reset—had officially transitioned from protocol to reality.
