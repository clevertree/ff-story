# Chapter 74: The Witch’s Return

**Objective:** The breach and materialization at Cradle Zero.

**Key Events:**
- Lem and Maya materialize at **Cradle Zero**, a high-security aetheric extraction lab.
- Maya (the "Witch") manifests in a physical Water-Vessel by overriding the lab's Synodic control systems.
- Maya's identity as a primary administrative spirit (from the 1.0 era) forces the facility's nanotech ("the Builders") to obey her instead of the Core's modern security protocols.
- Anton Drexler, observing through the command override, confronts Maya; she rejects his "mercy" and destroys the lab's primary aetheric scanners.
- Seeing her power, Anton activates "Containment Protocol Omega," ordering the evacuation and incineration of the lab.
- Lem observes the difference between human fear (the technicians fleeing) and Maya's cold control of the "spirits" within the machinery.
- Maya and Lem prepares to hunt the High-Vanes as the facility begins to burn.
