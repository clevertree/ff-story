# Chapter 12: Lynn

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus)
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
The mission team reaches the heart of the lunar pyramid, where General Ajax confronts Rahu. The situation escalates into a battle as Rahu reveals the Core's deception, leading to the destruction of Ajax and the shocking discovery that another Vessel has been hidden among the human ranks.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Inner Nexus:** Ajax leads the mission team into the pyramid's heart. Rahu stands bathed in a column of light. Lem, concealed in a standard military jumpsuit, follows close behind the unit.
2. **The Ultimatum:** General Ajax demands Rahu’s immediate surrender, calling for the cessation of hostilities.
3. **The Core Refusal:** Rahu refuses to cede control of "Cradle Alpha" to the Core Technocracy, challenging their right to the lunar facility.
4. **The People's Mandate:** Ajax rebuffs Rahu, stating he speaks not for the Core, but for a unified Earth government and the billions demanding an end to the "alien" invasion. He demands a full military occupation of the outpost.
5. **The Staged Revelation:** Rahu’s fire-signature flares in anger. He declares the invasion is a staged performance orchestrated by the Core itself to seize global power.
6. **The Soldier's Grief:** A mission soldier breaks rank, screaming that his family’s death from the Monolith strikes was no "staged attack." Iris Novak silences the outburst with sharp authority.
7. **Inoculated Deception:** Ajax dismisses Rahu's claims, stating the soldiers have been briefed for his specific deceptions. Rahu counters, asking if they have been "inoculated against the truth."
8. **The Ignition:** Ajax demands surrender one last time. In response, Rahu raises a long sword that ignites with a violent, white-hot flame.
9. **The Stasis Gambit:** Ajax orders the attack. Soldiers advance with shoulder-mounted cannons while Ajax wields a specialized gun-blade. Ajax signals "Stasis," and the team fires arcing beams of plasma and electricity at Rahu.
10. **The Counter-Grounding:** The beams strike Rahu, temporarily extinguishing his sword. With immense effort, he channels the energy through his blade into the floor, neutralizing the trap.
11. **The Feint:** Ajax lunges at Rahu, hoping to catch him off guard.
12. **The Redirection:** Rahu redirects the arcing beams in all directions and dashes forward. 
13. **The Strike:** He slices through Ajax with his flaming sword. 
14. **Ajax’s Destruction:** Ajax’s body, revealed as a non-human construction, singes, cracks, and shatters into fragments.
15. **The Retreat:** As the soldiers retreat in horror at Ajax's nature, Iris remains resolute. 
16. **The Taunt:** Rahu taunts them, asking if they still trust the Core now that their General is revealed as a machine.
17. **Iris's Resolve:** Iris admits she already knew. She explains that many trust the Vessels as humanity's allies against the invasion, and suggests Rahu has been corrupted or turned against Earth by the aliens early on.
18. **The Second Reveal:** Enraged by their "blind faith," Rahu lunges at a soldier who refuses to back off. He slices through the man, only for the body to shatter into fragments—revealing another Vessel. Rahu realizes he has destroyed Lynn.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
## Draft (13_PLUS)

The inner nexus of the lunar pyramid was a cathedral of geometric light, the air vibrating with the hum of the Moon’s buried machinery. General Ajax led our unit into the central chamber, his movements rigid and heavy. I followed in the wake of the squad, the standard-issue mission jumpsuit feeling tight across my chest, the anonymity of the uniform a strange comfort. In the center of the hall, bathed in a shimmering column of brilliance that seemed to descend from the very apex of the structure, stood Rahu.

Ajax did not wait. He stepped into the light, his silhouette a dark scar against the radiance. "Rahu," he boomed, his voice echoing off the windowless walls. "This ends now. Surrender the facility and stand down your signatures."

Rahu did not move, but his presence seemed to expand. "You ask for the keys to the heart of the world, General," he replied, his voice a low-frequency rumble. "Cradle Alpha does not belong to the Core Technocracy. It never did."

"I am not speaking for the Core," Ajax countered, his gun-blade humming in his grip. "I speak for the Unified Earth Government. I speak for the billions who watched their cities burn and their skies turn black. They demand an end to this invasion, and we will accept nothing less than a complete military occupation of this outpost. Surrender, or be dismantled."

Rahu’s shoulders tensed, and a visible heat began to shimmer around his frame. "An invasion?" he laughed, the sound jagged and bitter. "This performance... this staged 'threat' from the stars. It is a puppet show, Ajax. Orchestrated by the very masters you serve to ensure their grip on the grid is absolute."

"Liar!" A soldier to my left broke rank, his voice cracking with a raw, bleeding fury. "My family... they didn't die in a staged attack! They died in the rubble of Kansas! They died for real!"

"Stand down, soldier," Iris Novak’s voice was a steel whip, silencing the man instantly. She didn't look at the soldier; her eyes were locked on Rahu.

Ajax took a step forward. "It’s no use, Rahu. My men have been briefed on your specific deceptions. We know the nature of the 'Prophet' and the lies you use to sow discord."

Rahu tilted his head, the light from the column reflecting off his dark optics. "Inoculated against the truth, then? A surgical edit of the soul."

"Enough," Ajax growled. "One last time. Surrender."

In response, Rahu reached for the hilt at his hip. He drew a long, elegant blade and raised it toward the ceiling. With a violent *whoosh*, the metal ignited, a white-hot flame erupting from the alloy that turned the air to a shimmering haze.

"Stasis!" Ajax roared, falling back as he signaled the squad.

The soldiers snapped their shoulder-mounted cannons into position and fired. Arcing beams of plasma and crackling electricity tore through the air, converging on Rahu’s position. The noise was deafening, the smell of ozone filling the chamber as the energy sought its destination. Rahu held his position with immense effort, the white light of the beams washing over him. I watched as the fire on his sword flickered and then died, his frame trembling under the load.

For a heartbeat, it seemed the trap had worked. But then, Rahu’s posture shifted. He didn't fight the energy; he channeled it. He gripped his sword with both hands and plunged the tip into the stone floor. The arcing beams flowed into the metal and then disappeared into the ground, grounded into the very foundation of the pyramid.

Seeing the gambit fail, Ajax lunged forward, his gun-blade leading the charge. He hoped to capitalize on Rahu's supposed exhaustion, his heavy boots echoing like hammer strikes. The arcing beams hit Ajax as he passed through the crossfire, but they seemed to have no effect on him, sliding off his armor like water.

But Rahu was ready. He wrenched his sword from the floor, causing the residual energy to fly in all directions like a shattered mirror. His blade reignited with a roar, and he dashed forward—a blur of movement that defied the physics of the room. He was faster than the General could react. The fiery sword sliced through Ajax’s chest with terrifying ease.

The impact was not the sound of a man dying. It was the sound of a reinforced structure failing. Ajax’s body singed and cracked, and as he fell, he didn't bleed. He shattered. Severed parts—metallic, ceramic, and glowing with residual aether—hit the stone floor and scattered in a thousand pieces.

The soldiers backed away, their resolve breaking. "He’s... he wasn't human," someone whispered.

Iris Novak didn't move. Beside her, another soldier remained in position, their face hidden by a visor. "Stay in formation!" Iris commanded, her voice cutting through the panic.

Rahu stood over the fragments of the General, his flaming sword lowered. "Do you believe me now?" he taunted, looking at the unit. "Your hero was a construct. A tool of the Core. Will you die for a machine?"

"I already knew," Iris replied, her voice calm and absolute. "Many of us did. We choose to believe that the Vessels were sent to Earth to aid us against the invasion. We trust the architects who gave us a fighting chance when the stars turned against us. All except for you, Rahu. It seems the enemy got to you early. They turned you against your own kind."

"Faith in the secretive," Rahu spat, his fury reigniting. "You would die for a sanitized archive." He stepped toward the nearest soldier, his sword raised. "So be it."

He lunged. Lem, Iris, and the rest backed away, but the soldier beside Iris stood their ground. Rahu’s blade carved through the figure in a single, sweeping arc. But again, there was no blood. The body fell to the floor and shattered into molecular fragments that shimmered like silver rain.

Rahu froze, his sword-fire flickering. "No," he whispered, a sudden horror in his voice. "A Vessel... Lynn?"
