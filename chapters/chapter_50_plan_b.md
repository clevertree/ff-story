---

## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Request for Release:** Arlo asks to be returned to his village. He doesn't explain why, only stating that he doesn't feel the village is safe as long as he is away—or perhaps as long as he exists.
2.  **The Reluctant Dismissal:** The Crew hesitates, wanting to keep him as a potential asset, but they eventually realize that forced cooperation is useless. They let him go.
3.  **The Schism of the Crew:** Once Arlo is gone, the camp erupts into argument. Their "Plan A" (The Maya Connection) has failed. 
4.  **The Search for a Path Forward:** Some argue for a retreat to their secret hideout (the "New White Forest"), but most feel that giving up now means they have abandoned their old homes for nothing.
5.  **Plan B - Direct Assault:** The arguing coalesces into a new, darker resolve. If they cannot use a spiritual key to unlock the Core's defenses, they will use a hammer. They decide on a direct assault on **Cradle Zero** (the Desert Base/Fire City).
6.  **The Choice of Freedom:** One faction argues that even a doomed assault is better than living in the Archivist "Utopia" or hiding forever. "Let's plan part B," Myrr concludes. "An assault on the desert."

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Soldier Returns:** With the philosophical search for Maya failed, Lem reverts to his primary function: tactical deployment and resource manifestation.

### Myrr
-   **Hardened Leadership:** Myrr stops "brave pretending" and embraces the grim reality of a conventional war against a superior foe.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Cradle Zero's Escalation:** Establishing the Desert Base as the primary target for the resistance.
-   **Synodic Resistance Philosophy:** The debate between hiding ("Free Men") versus the "Utopian Haven."

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   Arlo's departure should feel like a mourning; the "Water" element of the team has been lost before it was ever truly found.
-   The transition to "Plan B" should be marked by a gear-up sequence—sharpening blades, checking scopes, and manifestion-dreaming.
