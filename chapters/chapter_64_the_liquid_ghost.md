## Chapter Outline

1.  **Movement in the Grave:** Just as Tor claims victory, spectator broadcasts pick up a horrifying sight: the monolith carcasses are moving. 
2.  **Metamorphosis:** The giant guns turn on again, but the carcasses don't die. They collapse into a liquid, globular stream of silver metal. 
3.  **The Formation of the Swarm:** The liquid metal flicks off into thousands of pieces. These pieces materialize into speeder bikes—unmanned, hovering, and perfectly formed.
4.  **The Kamikaze Run:** The bikes charge the gun batteries. They are too fast and too numerous for the ancient countermeasures. The bikes hit the guns, exploding and taking the batteries out one by one.
5.  **Breaching the Front:** The bike swarm bursts through the gun barrier, racing toward the base. 
6.  **Tor's Final Stand:** General Tor orders his army to regroup at the base entrances in a defensive posture. He reconfigures his force for a long assault, desperately trying to pick off the approaching swarm.
7.  **The Silhouette:** The broadcast footage zooms in on the lead bikes. Humanoids are appearing on them—not as physical beings, but as the dark, vengeful silhouettes of Maya.
8.  **The Recognition:** A spectator yells on a live feed: "It's Maya!" The name echoes across the cities. The "Witch" has returned to lead the mechanical swarm into the heart of the Core.

## Character Arc

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "liquid metal" transition should be described as eerie and organic—like a silver ocean boiling.
-   The explosion of the guns should feel like the breaking of the Old World's walls.
-   The chapter ends on the image of the thousand "Mayas" racing toward the gates of Cradle Zero.
