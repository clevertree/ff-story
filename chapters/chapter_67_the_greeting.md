# Chapter 67: The Greeting

## Outline / Summary
- **Entering the Spire:** Lem enters the main apparatus of the Spire City, moving toward the central hub.
- **The First Contact:** A Gorgon in a small, six-legged vehicle approaches Lem. It carries no visible weapons and shows no aggression.
- **The Mutual Greeting:** Lem initiates a peaceful gesture by raising his arm. The Gorgon mirrors the action, raising its own arm in greeting.
- **Telepathic Interface:** The Gorgon touches the back of Lem's head to establish a dream-state connection. Lem sees the Gorgon's true self-image: a small, humanoid alien with large eyes and low muscle mass.
- **The Language of Consonants:** Discovery of the Gorgon language—vowelless, hyper-organized, and spoken at high speed to humans (hissing).
- **The Village Question:** Lem asks why the Gorgons attack innocent villages in the North. The Gorgon reacts with intense anger, stating that Lem should already know the answer and refusing to justify their actions further. Lem realizes it was a loaded question and moves on.
- **The Rejection:** Lem presents the Core's deal. The Gorgon rejects it, revealing that the Core is using Lem and that the machines only followed Lynn because she exploited the Moon Capacitor's amplification.
- **The Stalemate & Snapping Back:** The Gorgon refuses peace but agrees to a stalemate. Within the dream state, it vowing that they will not lose another city to the Core and agrees to drop the fire shield for Lem's exit. The connection is severed, and Lem snaps back to reality, watching the soundless, mechanical Gorgon abruptly depart.
- **The Exit:** Lem walks back to the perimeter; the fire shield temporarily lowers to allow him through before flaring back up.
