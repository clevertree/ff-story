# Chapter 67: The Greeting

## Outline / Summary
- **Entering the Spire:** Lem enters the main apparatus of the Spire City, moving toward the central hub.
- **The First Contact:** A Gorgon in a small, six-legged vehicle approaches Lem. It carries no visible weapons and shows no aggression.
- **The Mutual Greeting:** Lem initiates a peaceful gesture by raising his arm. The Gorgon mirrors the action, raising its own arm in greeting.
- **Telepathic Interface:** The Gorgon touches the back of Lem's head to establish a dream-state connection. Lem sees the Gorgon's true self-image: a small, humanoid alien with large eyes and low muscle mass.
- **The Language of Consonants:** Discovery of the Gorgon language—vowelless, hyper-organized, and spoken at high speed to humans (hissing).
- **The Rejection:** Lem presents the Core's deal. The Gorgon rejects it, revealing that the Core is using Lem and that the machines only followed Lynn because she exploited the Moon Capacitor's amplification.
- **The Stalemate:** The Gorgon refuses peace but agrees to a stalemate. It temporarily drops the outer fire shield to let Lem leave, vowing that they will not lose another city to the Core.

## Character Development
- **Lem:** Approaches the "enemy" with respect rather than dominance.
