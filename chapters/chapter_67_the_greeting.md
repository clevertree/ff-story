# Chapter 67: The Greeting

## Outline / Summary
- **Entering the Spire:** Lem enters the main apparatus of the Spire City, moving toward the central hub.
- **The First Contact:** A Gorgon in a small, six-legged vehicle approaches Lem. It carries no visible weapons and shows no aggression.
- **The Mutual Greeting:** Lem initiates a peaceful gesture by raising his arm. The Gorgon mirrors the action, raising its own arm in greeting.
- **Telepathic Interface:** The Gorgon touches the back of Lem's head to establish a dream-state connection. Lem sees the Gorgon's true self-image: a small, humanoid alien with large eyes and low muscle mass.
- **The Language of Consonants:** Discovery of the Gorgon language—vowelless, hyper-organized, and spoken at high speed to humans (hissing).
- **The Village Question:** Lem asks why the Gorgons attack innocent villages in the North. The Gorgon reacts with intense anger, stating that Lem should already know the answer and refusing to justify their actions further. Lem realizes it was a loaded question and moves on.
- **The Rejection:** Lem presents the Core's deal. The Gorgon rejects it with bitter irony, pointing out that Lem has walked the surface and should already know why they refuse. The Gorgons refuse the Core for the same reason the northern villagers do: to "unify" is to be consumed. They know the Core doesn't want peace, only a single controllable system where they can dismantle minds more efficiently. The Gorgon highlights the hypocrisy of the offer, questioning if the Core even has the capacity to free the enslaved Gorgons in the Hive Cities when the entire human "paradise" depends on their labor.
- **The Stalemate & Snapping Back:** The Gorgon makes it clear he understands exactly what a stalemate represents—a precarious survival outside the Core's reach. They are willing to accept this status quo, hoping the Core will be satisfied with the one city they've already lost (Cradle Zero). Before the connection ends, Lem asks how to save the northern village from future Gorgon attacks; the Gorgon coldly replies that they must "destroy every Gorgon that attacks it." Apparently decided the conversation is at an end, the Gorgon disconnects the physical/dreamstate connection. Lem snaps back to reality, watching the soundless, mechanical Gorgon abruptly depart.
- **The Exit:** Lem walks back to the perimeter; the fire shield temporarily lowers to allow him through before flaring back up.
