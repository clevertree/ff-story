# Chapter 19: The New Lab

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Cradle Zero / Refashioned Archivist Laboratory

---

## Outline / Summary

Lem awakes to find his "Gorgon" consciousness is gone. He is no longer looking through the eyes of a builder; instead, he exists only as a flickering image on a monitor. He realizes he has been removed from the Gorgon corpse and is now a disembodied digital presence being analyzed by the Archivist staff.

The laboratory is a mixture of ancient Earth design and cold, Archivist clinical technology. He sees Dr. Aris Vane—now visibly older and heavily influenced by Archivist technology—examining his files. She is clearly troubled by what she sees, particularly the data burst Rahu sent before his collapse.

Lem observes the staff discussing the "Mara Program." They believe they have captured the soul of the enemy. Lem feels a strange sense of irony; they are analyzing him like a piece of malicious software while he simply watches them from the screen. He begins to explore the local network, realizing that even without a body, he has more freedom than he did as a Gorgon.
