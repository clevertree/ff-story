# Chapter 24: Siege

**Setting:** Northern Hive Periphery; The Desert Plain; *Obsidian Sledge* (Flagship)
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The First Strike:** Lem and Myrr lead the planned "Tree Army"—bio-mechanical assault units reinforced with White Forest wood—in a massive offensive against Cradle Zero.
2. **The Node Theory:** Myrr's team honestly believes the city nodes are purely control nodes and not power plants. They conclude that taking them out will sever the Core's command link without harming civilian infrastructure, despite the large cables leading into the city. 
3. **The Propaganda War:** As they breach the walls, the Core's media channels begin broadcasting a "Terrorist" narrative, portraying the resistance as mindless Gorgon monsters attacking civilian infrastructure.
4. **The Node Trap:** The tree army dismantles a primary tower, only to realize too late that the nodes actually *were* power plants. It was a trap: the Core ensured everyone in the city believes the structures are vital civilian power stations.
5. **The Public Accusation:** As the lights go out, the Core's media broadcasts footage of a city planner—possibly a crisis actor—pleading for mercy and accusing the resistance of knowing they were taking out the power of an entire city. Myrr's team realizes they have been branded as specialists in civilian suffering.
They realize the people of the Hive will never see them as liberators, but only as the "Terrorists"
6. **The Rising Resistance:** Myrr takes command of the chaos, arguing that if they are already labeled terrorists, they must achieve their objective by any means necessary. He orders a full assault directly on the Cradle Zero desert base. 
7. **The General’s Entrance:** General Tor’s flagship, the *Obsidian Sledge*, emerges from the thermal haze. Tor broadcasts a single message: "To all Terrorists - surrender or be destroyed."
8. The Tree Army engages in a large scale battle with the Core defences. It appears to have the upperhand as the White Forest crew are able to order it to rebuild itself when it's destroyed. The Core technology takes much longer to build.
9. **Rahu's Ambush:** However, the flagship of the Tree Army crewed by a white forest soldier crashes to the ground unexpectedly. It's engines explode leaving the hull of the ship stranded. Other ships suddenly explode as well.
The crew identifies Rahu who has deceptively entered the battle camouflaged with desert colors.  
10. **Rahu:** The Tree Army focuses on Rahu but to no avail. He is hard to see in the rising dust and his entire vehicle is camouflaged. He is too battle hardened for the white forest crew who themselves have never experienced a battle. 
11. **Retreat:** Rahu destroyes another flagship with a human white forest soldier in the cockpit and the ship crashes, except this time it explodes completely in a bright fireball. This is too much for the white forest crew and they evacuate the remaining personel from the battle while leaving their tree army behind to continue fighting. 
12. The battle turns in the Core's favor as the white forest crew are no longer in the battle to direct it. Rahu and the Core waste no time and burn the remaining tree army to ashes.

## Synopsis
Lem and Myrr lead the White Forest's "Tree Army" in an assault on Cradle Zero, only to find themselves ensnared in a sophisticated propaganda trap. Myrr’s team honestly believed that the nodes they targeted were purely control nodes, but in reality, they were the city's power plants. The Core used this as a trap, ensuring the entire city viewed the resistance as monstrous terrorists who knowingly cut off civilian power. As crisis actors fuel the Hive's outrage, the tactical advantage of the regenerative bio-mechanical units is undermined by the psychological toll of the narrative war. The arrival of General Tor’s *Obsidian Sledge* and the intervention of a camouflaged Rahu turn the tide, forcing the inexperienced White Forest crew to panic and retreat, abandoning their army to be incinerated by Core forces.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I stood next to Myrr on the command deck, watching the Tree Army tear through the perimeter. We honestly thought we were taking out control nodes—things that would hurt the Core without hurting the people. But they were power plants. Real ones. And the Core had a guy on camera, some city planner, crying about how we knew exactly what we were doing when we took out the power for an entire city. As the screens lit up with images of dark clinics and stalled elevators, Myrr went pale. He realized the trap: to the people inside, we weren't liberators. We were just the "Terrorists" the Core had always said we were.

"If that’s what we are," Myrr whispered, his voice turning cold, "then let’s finish the job."

He ordered the push toward the desert base, but then the *Obsidian Sledge* dropped out of the haze. General Tor’s voice boomed over the comms, telling us to surrender. And then came Rahu. He was a ghost in the dust, camouflaged so well we couldn't even target him. One of our ships went down, then another. The White Forest crew wasn't ready for a real fight. They’d never been in a war before. When the second ship exploded in a massive fireball, they hit the panic button. We retreated, leaving the Tree Army behind to be burnt to ashes.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The assault on Cradle Zero was a victory for the Core before the first spear of wood even touched the wall. Myrr’s warriors believed they were striking at the enemy’s mind, cutting the pillars of their control. But the pillars were a trap—the very lungs of the city. As our bio-mechanical giants tore the towers down, the sky began to scream with the Core’s lies. We watched as a weeping puppet of the Hive, a man calling himself a keeper of the city’s life, begged for mercy on every screen. He accused us of knowing the truth—that by toppling the towers, we were stealing the warmth and the light from a million innocent lives. Myrr watched the lights of the city go out, one by one, and his face turned to ash. He realized that in the eyes of the world, we weren't liberators. We were the monsters the Core had always warned them would come.

“They have stolen the truth from us,” Myrr whispered, his voice like grinding stone. “If they want monsters, let us show them what a monster can do.”

But the darkness we brought was matched by a shadow from the horizon. The *Obsidian Sledge*, the great iron whale of General Tor, broke through the desert haze. Tor’s voice boomed across the sands—a hammer-blow of words calling us murderers and thieves. Then came Rahu. He was a ghost in the shimmering heat, his armor painted the color of the dunes, mocking our eyes and our sensors alike. He was a wolf among sheep. Myrr’s crew had trained in the quiet halls of the forest, but Rahu had been forged in the fire of a thousand wars. When our great command ships began to bloom into torches of fire and screaming wood, the heart of our army broke. The retreat was a panicked scramble into the North, leaving our wooden brothers to be burnt to cinders by the Core’s iron wrath. We didn't just lose a battle; we lost the story of the world.
### Lem
- **The Analyst of Defeat:** Lem observes the precision of the Core’s propaganda machine, noting that narrative control is more effective than physical armor.
- **Variable Observer:** He identifies Rahu as a superior tactical variable, noting the disparity between the White Forest's theoretical training and Rahu's practical lethality.

### Myrr
- **The Moral Collapse:** He is devastated by the realization that their cause is being rewritten in real-time.
- **The Tactical Realist:** He accepts the "Terrorist" designation as an unavoidable consequence of the mission.
- **The Defeated Commander:** He experiences the first major failure of his new leadership.
