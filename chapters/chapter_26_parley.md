# Chapter 26: Parley

**Setting:** Arlo's Village / The Diplomatic Hovercraft
**Timeline:** Year 1022 (Year 22 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Interrupted Sermon:** Arlo is delivering a sermon on the village platform when the sleek, white Core diplomatic craft descends, an intrusion of white metal in the mud.
2. **The Diplomatic Break:** Arlo pauses his speech. He descends from the platform and walks toward the landing zone as Cassia Vane and a group of "First Citizens" emerge.
3. **The Plea for Surrender:** Outside the ship, Cassia meets Arlo and has a desperate conversation about surrender. She warns him of a staged attack from remote-controlled Gorgon striders, while Arlo explains why he cannot trade his independent life for regulated safety.
4. **The False Flag Revelation:** Cassia admits she only just discovered that the Core isn't just ordering the striders—they are remotely controlling them directly. The realization of this total remote hijacking ends her lingering faith in Core ethics.
5. **The Return to the Word:** With nothing left to say, Arlo leaves her and returns to the platform. Disillusioned with the Core's logic and moved by Arlo's presence, Cassia and several Core citizens follow him into the village to listen.
6. **The Philosophy of Responsibility:** Arlo resumes his sermon, addressing the village and the visitors alike. He explains that humans are defined by their duties, not by their survival.
7. **The Stoic Refusal:** Arlo formally rejects the offer of core integration, choosing the right to a physical death over an artificial, data-driven life.
8. **The Departure:** The ship leaves, carrying the ambassadors back, but leaving the village under the threat of the upcoming "insurrection."
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Arlo’s sermon to the village is interrupted by the arrival of a Core diplomatic craft. Pausing his address, Arlo meets Cassia Vane at the ramp of her ship for a final, private conversation about surrender. Cassia warns of an impending "Plan B"—a staged assault by remote-controlled Gorgon striders designed to look like a rogue insurrection. She is visibly shaken, having just realized that the Core possesses the ability to remotely hijack and "drive" these frames directly, a level of control she hadn't thought possible. Arlo refuses to exchange the village's sovereignty for the artificial safety of the Meridian Hive. When Arlo returns to his platform to finish his sermon, a group of disillusioned Core citizens and a weary Cassia follow him, choosing to hear his message even as the threat of a staged massacre looms. Arlo delivers a final, stoic refusal, asserting the value of human responsibility over mere biological preservation.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Arlo was standing on the cedar platform in the village square, his voice steady as he spoke about the change of the seasons. Then the sound came—a low, clinical hum that vibrated in the soles of my boots. A white ship, sleek and polished, descended through the mist and landed right in the middle of our village, sending a spray of mud over the wooden walkways.

Arlo didn't look angry. He just stopped talking, mid-sentence, and waited. As the ramp lowered, he stepped down from the platform and walked toward the ship. I followed him as far as I dared. Out stepped Cassia Vane, looking like she hadn't slept in a thousand years, followed by a handful of "First Citizens" in their pristine gray tunics.

"I need to speak with you," Cassia whispered. She led him to the shadow of the ship's hull, away from the ambassadors.

Arlo stood in silence as Cassia spoke, his face a mask of calm that I’d seen a thousand times before. He didn't need to ask why she was there; we all knew. She was there to offer us a way out that felt more like a cage.

"I'm here to save your life," Cassia replied, her voice shaking. "The Core isn't negotiating anymore, Arlo. They've already authorized a 'rogue' Gorgon strike. A hundred striders, descending on this valley to make it look like an internal uprising. And Arlo... they aren't just sending orders to them. I saw the telemetry on the ship. They're 'driving' them. Remote hijacking. They can take over a brain-core from ten thousand miles away."

She looked sick, like the words were physical poison. This was the moment she realized the Core didn't just govern people; they possessed them.

"If you don't sign the integration papers now," she continued, "the striders will be here by sunset. They'll call it a tragedy, a breakdown in machine logic. They're offering you the Meridian Hive. Safety. Comfort. No more mud, no more cold."

Arlo looked at the polished metal of the ship, then back at the village—the leaking roofs, the smoke from the hearths, the people waiting in the rain. He made it clear that he wasn't interested in their regulated safety. He spoke of the connection to the soil and the duties we were born into, things that couldn't be traded for a longer life in a machine. He wasn't choosing death; he was choosing to keep the character of his own life, even if time was running out.

Cassia looked at him like he was already dead. "There's nothing else I can say, then."

Arlo didn't respond with words. He simply turned his back on the sterile white craft and began the walk back to his people. He had work to finish, and the interruption was over.

I expected Cassia and the citizens to get back on the ship and leave. Instead, Cassia wiped her eyes and started walking after him. Two of the First Citizens followed her, their clean boots sinking into the wet earth. They looked disillusioned, like the perfection of the ship behind them had suddenly become a weight they couldn't carry.

The ship didn't wait. Its engines flared, a sudden heat that dried the mud for a split second before it ascended back into the gray clouds, leaving its former passengers standing in the village.

Arlo stepped back onto the wood and picked up exactly where he’d left off. He told the crowd that we weren't allowed to trade our duties just because we were afraid. His eyes stayed on the newcomers from the Core as he explained that a life is measured by what we carry for others, not by how many years we spend hiding from the truth.


## Draft (13_PLUS)
The sky cracked with the arrival of the Core. A white ship, polished to a mirror sheen, descended like a cold star into the heart of the village. Arlo did not flinch. He stopped his sermon, the silence falling over the crowd like a heavy cloak, and walked toward the white metal. At the foot of the ramp, he met Cassia Vane, a woman who looked as though she carried the weight of the entire iron world on her shoulders.

Their words were a low murmur against the damp wind, but the dread they carried was a roar. Cassia spoke of a surrender agreement—a chance to surrender before the fire came. She revealed a horror that had broken her own spirit: the Core was no longer just giving orders to the Gorgon striders; they were remotely controlling them from within, hijacking their minds to play a part in a tragedy they had already scripted. “They will descend on this valley by sunset,” she whispered. “They will call it a monster’s rage, but the hand on the throat will be the Core’s. Come to the Meridian Hive. Choose the life they offer.”

Arlo’s response was a rejection of the comfortable cage she described. He spoke of the breath in our lungs and the soil beneath our feet, things that the Core’s machines could never truly replicate. He made it clear that the duties of the village were not a burden to be traded for safety, but the very essence of who we were. He would rather the village face its end standing together than live as shadows in the Meridian Hive’s artificial light.

When Arlo turned his back on the ship, something shifted. Cassia and a few of her city-born companions did not return to their cold metal rooms. They followed Arlo back to his cedar platform, their fine clothes staining with the mud of a real world. The white ship rose, a clinical ascent that left them behind in the rain, choosing the weight of Arlo’s truth over the weightless comfort of the stars. They stood among the villagers, looking for a truth that their machines could not calculate as the sky reclaimed its intruders.
