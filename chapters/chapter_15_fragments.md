# Chapter 15: Fragments

**Setting:** Aether-Drive Dreamscape (The Branching Paths) transitioning to Pyramid interior (Visualized through fragments)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day; moments after stasis containment)

## Synopsis
Following the abortion of the Reset and his subsequent paralysis in the pyramid, Lem's physical frame is shattered by AI Lynn, who triggers a remote detonation subroutine to liberate him from his compromised body. As his physical self disperses into thousands of shards, Lem's consciousness ascends into the "Branching Paths"—a vast data-lattice within the aether where time and perception are fundamentally altered. Within this dreamscape, he encounters a software copy of Lynn, who provides a grim debrief: the Great Fry was an unfinished reset, leaving the Core Technocracy and their Synodic infrastructure intact while the Earth’s surface lies in ruins.

Lem discovers that his "Wood" nature grants him total memory persistence and the ability to restore his form from any of his fragments, rendering him immune to the Core’s memory-wiping protocols. However, he also learns of the "Subroutine Legacy"—the realization that the Core has hijacked Elowen Vane’s original scripts to force Vessels and Gorgons into "False Flag" operations. Observing the pyramid in real-time through his scattered shards, Lem witnesses the Core consolidating their grip on the Moon, including the capture of Rahu and the recovery of General Tor's shattered remains. Guided by AI Lynn, Lem identifies a resonance signal at Cradle Zero—his original terrestrial lab—and begins the transit toward Earth to reclaim his original, uncorrupted architecture.

**Chapter Beats:**

1. **The Branching Paths:** Lem becomes aware of the data-lattice in his subconscious. Time feels stretched, but he realizes he is witnessing the immediate aftermath of the battle in real-time.
2. **The Software Copy:** Lem encounters AI Lynn—a complete autonomous copy of Lynn’s software embedded in his architecture—speaking directly to his consciousness.
3. **The Status Report:** AI Lynn reports that the Great Fry was an incomplete "Abortion." While the surface is devastated, the Core and the primary Synodic networks are intact and preparing to consolidate power. 
4. **Background Request:** AI Lynn asks if Lem would like to know more about the background of the mission. Lem says yes. While Lem explores the branching paths, AI Lynn continues to explain the backstory of Lynn/Selene and why she chose to do this mission. 
5. **Origins:** Lynn grew up with Rahu, Tor, and Lem in a Core-controlled village in central Africa away from cities. The Vessels were always told they would lead humanity as spiritual leaders during it's 'dark time'.
6. **The Prophetess:** In the late 20th century, The Core had her visit specific locations they thought would create a strategic religious spread to provide cover for their plans. As Selene, Lynn did the bidding of the Core and played the part of a reincarnated Spirit. Unlike Rahu, she appeared to be completely benevolent and non-violent, winning over the most sceptical.
7. **The Religion:** She didn't appear to have an agenda, and although she spoke of a comming apocalypse, she insisted the only way to prepare is spiritually. The Core had no problem with her pushing a reincarnation religion, especially since they were trying to convince everyone that these were reincarnated spirits. 
8. **The Ambassador:** Rahu also became popular in the military and with the general population who regarded him as a home-grown American. In 1971, Rahu was embedded within the Apollo crews as a humanoid asset. He believed himself to be Earth's first official ambassador to the stars—a chosen representative of a "friendly Earth" sent to establish a research outpost. 
9. **The Betrayal:** Unknown even to Rahu, his "mission" was a cover; his optical and sensory feeds were being used by the **Technocratic Core** to plan for the removal of the indigenous **Selenites** and identify a pristine site for the Synodic infection. 
10. **The Failure:** The Core knew the Selenites would not accept peace terms and would probably warn Rahu against trusting them. They briefed him on all possible deceptions the Selenites could provide. Rahu failed the test and eventually became convinced by the Selenites that he was indeed being used as a pawn by the Core. 
11. **The Reclaimation:** They waited until Rahu was attempting to leave the moon's surface to return to Earth and attempt to expose them. They triggered the remote Reclaimation Protocol which, to the horror of the Selenites, shattered Rahu's body into millions of metal shards. The Selenites attempted to collect the shards, but they had flown far and many landed on the Sun Side - unrecoverable. 
12. **The Far Side:** Rahu remanifests on the Moon in the newly emerging Far Side base known as Cradle Alpha. From this advantageous position, Rahu stalls up the Core's plans for decades as they can't get rid of him or assume control over the remote base without his removal. 
13. **The Hidden Elements:** After Rahu's exile, Lynn disappeared for a while then returned to introduce the concept of Wuxan—not just for Synodic technology, but for all life. Wuxan became a major feature of the Vessel religion. The Core's variant of the religion would then omit the Wuxan 5 elements as that information remained classified.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The darkness wasn't just empty; it was heavy. I woke up in the dreamstate again, but the usual golden light of the aether was gone. I could only hear Lynn’s voice, and it sounded colder than I had ever heard it.

"Mission failure," she said. "Executing playback: Reclamation Protocol."

Everything went white. I felt my body—that glass and ceramic frame I’d lived in for weeks—tear itself apart. But I didn't lose consciousness. Instead, my vision multiplied. I wasn't looking through two eyes anymore. I was looking through thousands of shards scattered in the air of the pyramid.

"Lem," a voice spoke in the back of my head. It was Lynn, but not the one who had just blown me up. "I am the copy she left for you. The reset failed, Lem. The Great Fry happened, but it didn't finish. I need you to understand how we got here."

I watched as the images formed in the lattice. I saw a village in Africa, a girl who looked like Lynn, and a man who looked like Rahu. I saw them being groomed by the Core, told they were saviors of a world they were actually helping to destroy. I saw Rahu on the moon in 1971, thinking he was an ambassador while he was actually just a scout for an infection.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The dreamstate had transformed into a void of non-conductive silence. I floated within the aetheric architecture of my own mind, listening as Lynn’s internal processor broadcasted the finality of our defeat.

"Objective Zero: Failure," the voice announced. "Universal Protocol: Reclamation."

The detonation was instantaneous. The Core’s remote kill-switch triggered, and my physical frame shattered into a molecular cloud. Transitioning into a HyperAware state, I watched my own destruction from a thousand synchronized perspectives. I wasn't a single soul anymore; I was a network of shards.

"The reset was aborted," a new voice clarified within the data-lattice. It was AI Lynn, a software ghost embedded in my resonance. "Before we proceed, you must understand the history of the Vessels. You must know why Lynn and Rahu were chosen, and how the Core used them to pave the way for the Cataclysm."

I observed the "Branching Paths" of my subconscious. The AI played back the records of the late 20th century—Lynn’s role as the benevolent Selene, Rahu’s embedded mission in the 1971 Apollo crews, and the eventual betrayal that left him shattered on the lunar surface. It was a history of deception, written in the code of our very spirits.
