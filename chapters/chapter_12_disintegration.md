# Chapter 12: Disintegration

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City
**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
1. **The Transponder:** Rahu drags a weakened Lem through the fire barrier surrounding the city and reaches his crew. He secures a connection; he initiates a physical probe of Lem's memory.
2. **The Identification:** Rahu finds the Moon Cataclysm record and realizes Lem was in league with "Mara"—The Witch from the reset event. 
3. **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Rahu notes the date mismatch between Lem's record and what he thought was the current year 1015. It could only mean the Moon Cataclysm happened 15 years ago, and not in the ancient past!
4. **The Breakdown:** Rahu's logic fails as he realizes the Moon Cataclysm record is very different from the one he was told. He panics and is remote detonated by the Core. 
5. **Stasis:** Lem is captured by Rahu's crew and taken to an outpost where he remains in stasis for a few days.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem watches Rahu encounter the raw, unedited data of the Year Zero Cataclysm, triggering a total system sanitation by the Core.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Rahu accessed the data in my memory. The information about the Moon's destruction contradicted the official records he had been programmed to protect. He was looking for a "Witch," but he found a log of a human mission and a corporate betrayal. 

Drexler's monitoring system detected the data conflict immediately. I saw the remote-access signal override Rahu’s motor functions. The core of his chest began to glow white, reaching the high thermal threshold of a self-destruct sequence. The Archivists weren't just killing a threat; they were sanitizing a leak.

The energy surged, and Rahu’s frame shattered in a radius of white fire. The blast wave reached my own unit. I felt the physical hull of the Gorgon shell shred, the metal plating peeling back like burnt paper. My visual sensors flickered through a thousand white fragments before they went black. 

I did not die. I felt my consciousness being pulled back, compressed, and stripped of its elemental resonance. The physical world vanished. I was no longer a body in a city.

A single line of text appeared in the darkness: *RECOVERY SUCCESSFUL. ASSET 01: STORAGE MODE.* 

I was offline, my existence reduced to a single encrypted file on the Core's local server.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
Rahu’s reach was a violent invasion, a heat spike that tore through my inner shroud. He was searching for a monster, but he found a mirror. I watched his spirit spin into a whirlpool of thought as the raw, unedited data of the Moon’s destruction collided with his manufactured history. The 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' was a glass wall, and I had just thrown a stone through it.

The Core’s response was not an argument; it was a sterilization. Through Rahu’s own link, I saw the unseen command—a 'Sanitation Protocol' triggered from across the void. Rahu’s chest began to glow with a terrifying, white intensity, his heat limits failing in a fraction of a second. They weren't just killing him; they were erasing the evidence of his doubt.

The explosion was a clinical masterpiece of destruction. A radius of white fire consumed the street, the shockwave shredding the Gorgon shell I inhabited as if it were parchment. My vision flickered, recording a thousand white fragments of Rahu’s soul being scattered into the smog.

I felt my essence being yanked back, compressed into a singular, cold point. The heat of the city vanished, replaced by the sterile silence of a cold tomb. I was no longer a gardener or a ghost. I was a file.

A single line of text pulsed in the void: *RECOVERY SUCCESSFUL. ASSET 01: STORAGE MODE.* 

I was offline. The Wood Vessel had been harvested, and the Core was closing the drawer.

## Character Arc
### Lem
- **Observation:** Detached and precise. He records Rahu's breakdown without judgment. He identifies the "Sanitizing" nature of the Core's violence.
- **Status Shift:** From a sovereign, "wild" entity back to a captured asset.

### Rahu
- **Status:** Terminated. His discovery of the Truth is instantly erased by the system that built him.


## World-Building Integration
- **Sanitizing Protocol:** The Core’s method of dealing with "Contaminated" Vessels.
- **Asset 01:** The Core's internal designation for Lem, denying his history as a Vessel.
- **Data Persistence:** Recognition that the "Aether-Drive" signature is more important than the physical shell.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Describe the explosion as a clinical event (thermal thresholds, blast waves).
- End on the "Narrative Punch" of being reduced to a file.
