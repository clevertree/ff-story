- The Core detects the feedback loop and "Forbidden Data" breach.
- A remote detonation is triggered via master authorization keys.
- Rahu's physical form is instantly incinerated by his own elemental core.
- The explosion shatters Lem's Gorgon body; the area is sanitized of data contamination.

## Outline / Summary

Lem experiences the sensation of his memory being accessed. Rahu's link to his psyche is heavy. Lem watches as Rahu encounters the raw, unedited data of the Year Zero Cataclysm. The revelation triggers an immediate physical collapse in Rahu—a logical failure caused by the collision of his mandated "False Hero" narrative with physical reality. He begins to vibrate with high-frequency tremors.

The Core, operating remotely from the Lunar Pyramid, detects the massive feedback loop and the "Forbidden Data" breach. A remote detonation is triggered. I did not know then that a man named Anton Drexler had signed the order; I only saw the result. Rahu's physical form is instantly incinerated by the heat of his own elemental core.

Rahu's body explodes, the force of the blast shattering Lem's Gorgon body. In the aftermath, the Core sweeps up Lem's disembodied aetheric presence.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Observation:** Detached and precise. He records Rahu's breakdown without judgment. He observes the pressure points of the Vessel's logic.

### Rahu
- **Status:** Complete physical and logical breakdown followed by remote detonation. His discovery of the Truth is instantly sanitized.

## World-Building Integration

- **Remote Detonation:** A high-level safety ritual (potentially automated) that eliminates any Vessel that processes "The Truth."
- **Core Operations:** Demonstrates the Archivists' fear of data contamination and their absolute authority over their "assets."

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Synanthrope Breakdown:** The physical toll of emotional and memory-driven logical errors on a Metal Vessel.
✅ **Communication Tunnels:** The high-speed data burst sent to the Lunar Pyramid ensures the message outlives the sender.
✅ **Brittle Nature of Gorgons:** Lem's body breaking under impact reinforces the "Builders" profile.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
