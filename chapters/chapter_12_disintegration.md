# Chapter 12: Disintegration

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City
**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem watches Rahu encounter the raw, unedited data of the Year Zero Cataclysm.
**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City

---

## Draft
Rahu accessed the data in my memory. The information about the Moon's destruction contradicted the official records.

Drexler's monitoring system detected the data conflict and triggered a sanitizing protocol, increasing the energy inside Rahu until it destroyed his frame. After a surge of heat, his signal was gone.

My body was destroyed in an explosion that shredded the metal hull, causing my unit to come apart before technicians collected and cataloged the fragments.

I was offline, my data stored only as a file in the system.

## Character Arc
### Lem
- **Observation:** Detached and precise. He records Rahu's breakdown without judgment. He observes the pressure points of the Vessel's logic.

### Rahu
- **Status:** Complete physical and logical breakdown followed by remote detonation. His discovery of the Truth is instantly sanitized.

## World-Building Integration
- **Remote Detonation:** A high-level safety ritual (potentially automated) that eliminates any Vessel that processes "The Truth."
- **Core Operations:** Demonstrates the Archivists' fear of data contamination and their absolute authority over their "assets."

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
