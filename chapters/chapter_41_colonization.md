# Chapter 41: Colonization

**Setting:** White Forest Outpost
**Timeline:** Year 1024 (Year 24 AT - The Surface Climax)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Iron Rain:** On the feed, Lem watches General Tor’s flagship, the *Obsidian Sledge*, activate the "Ancient Arsenal." Primitive ballistics scream from the ship's massive underslung batteries into the desert, shredding the first wave of machines into a field of thermal wreckage, but they keep coming, closing the distance and using the carcasses as cover.
2. **The Hero of the Hive:** The Synodic army seems unstoppable until Rahu joins the fray. The media praises his intervention. Rahu moves with impossible speed, his Mirror Vessel frame reflecting the desert sun as he carves through the resistance units.
3. **Clearing the Field:** Rahu rapidly disables the smaller tripods and light speeders, stripping the army of its shielding. This allows the *Obsidian Sledge* to focus its massive batteries on the slow-moving monoliths, which are systematically brought down. Every Synodic unit that approached the base perimeter is destroyed.
4. **The Fire City Diversion:** The news notes that a significant portion of the Gorgon force abruptly curves away from the base, heading instead toward the defunct ruins of the Fire City. Despite this diversion, the Core media declares an absolute victory: the threat has been neutralized and the cities (and consequentially the Core's primary base) have been saved from the invasion by the heroes Rahu and Tor.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The siege of Cradle Zero concludes on screen as Lem watches from the White Forest outpost. On flickering feeds, he witnesses General Tor use kinetic weapon systems to shred the initial wave of machines, while Tor and Rahu are deployed as Core champions to protect the cities. The mechanical army appears to be systematically dismantled by Rahu’s high-speed strikes and the flagship’s massive batteries. Despite a portion of the Gorgon force diverting toward the Fire City ruins, the Core media declares an absolute victory, praising Rahu and Tor for saving the Hive from the alien invasion.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The counter-offensive began while I watched the terminal screen at the forest outpost. The *Obsidian Sledge* activated its kinetic batteries, raining heavy steel shells onto the desert floor. The impact generated massive thermal plumes that obscured the sensor feeds. The machine army was being systematically dismantled. I did not know then that Rahu had already been deployed to the perimeter. The media outlets identified him as a Core champion. He moved with a high-velocity reflection, disabling the lighter tripod units to allow the flagship to focus its fire on the monoliths. Within minutes, the physical threat to the base appeared to be neutralized. A group of Gorgons redirected their path toward the Fire City ruins, but the news reports ignored them. The broadcast declared a total victory.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
I watched the screen as the machines moved toward the base. The giant Core ships rained steel down on the desert, turning the army of the forest into a field of scrap. The Synodic units were being destroyed until Rahu entered the battle. The media called him a hero once again. He disabled the smaller tripods with high-speed strikes, letting the heavy guns target the monoliths. Soon, everything that had touched the base wall was gone. A group of Gorgons turned away, heading for the old Fire City, but the news declared the war was won.
