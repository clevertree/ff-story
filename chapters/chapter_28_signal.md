## Synopsis
After years of exile, a persistent vision of a golden flame in Lem's dreamscape eventually compels him to travel physically to its source. He refuses to use the painful process of reincarnation or remote-viewing, choosing instead a long pilgrimage on foot. He arrives back at the location of his third mission outside the Northern Village, finding a landscape of charred ruins and blackened trees—a graveyard of giants left behind by the Core's "Sanitization" strike. There, amidst the ash and skeletal remains, he is intercepted by Myrr and a band of shadow-walkers, who are stunned to find their old friend has returned.

Then I saw the flame again. It was a golden pulse at the end of a long, winding tunnel in my memories. It wouldn't go out. It felt like a heartbeat calling to me, a signal that refused to be ignored. I could have tried to "jump" there, but I remembered the agony of the last reset. I decided to find the fire on foot.

I walked for weeks, following a compass only I could see. My journey led me back to the frozen North, to the very place where my third mission had ended in fire. 

The transformation was heartbreaking. The forest I had once tried to save was gone. In its place was a graveyard of giants. Every tree was a blackened, skeletal husk, their branches reaching for a grey sky like charred fingers. The metal frames of the destroyed striders were still scattered across the ash. I stood in the center of the ruins. 

A soldier in armor that rippled like wood grain stepped forward, aiming a pulse rifle at my chest. Then, he froze. He pulled off his helmet, and I saw a face from a lifetime ago. 

"Lem?" Myrr whispered. "We thought you were just an echo. A shadow that didn't know it was dead."

But the flame was a persistent melody in the dark.

It appeared at the end of a long, forgotten corridor of my spirit—a golden, pulsating heat that resonated with the very core of my being. It was a beacon I could not ignore, a call to a destination I had tried to forget. Rather than enduring the shattering transition of a remote-view, I chose the physical path, walking through the storms and the sunlight to find the source of the flame.

My pilgrimage led me back to the frozen North, to the site where my light had first been extinguished by the Core’s betrayal. It was the place where Anton’s voice had once turned my world to white fire.

The transformation was heartbreaking. The forest that had once been a bastion of life was now a graveyard of giants. Every tree was a blackened, skeletal husk, their crystalline hearts shattered by the merciless heat of the orbital strike. I stood in the ash at the previous mission site. 

I turned to find a warrior in living-wood armor, his rifle steady. But as his gaze swept over my crystal frame, the weapon lowered. He pulled back his hood, revealing the scarred features of my old friend.

"Lem?" Myrr breathed, his voice a mix of awe and terror. "We thought you were an echo—a shadow that didn't know it was dead."
