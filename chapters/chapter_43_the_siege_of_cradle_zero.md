## Chapter Outline

1.  **Hollowing the Shell:** The Wood-grown monoliths finish dismantling the Node's core. It has been reduced to a hollow shell, and as expected, the city appears unaffected.
2.  **The Primary Cable:** The machines prepare to remove the final component: a massive cylinder cable leading from the Node directly into the city's foundation. The Crew speculates it is a control link or a sedative broadcast for the population.
3.  **The Switch:** The moment the machines sever the cable, the entire Hive City goes dark. The blackout is instantaneous and total—a giant light switch being flicked off across miles of urban landscape.
4.  **The Propaganda Trap:** The Crew monitors the emergency airwaves. A high-priority briefing immediately replaces the standard static: "The terrorist enemy has just struck the city's primary power node. Hundreds of thousands are without life-support. The terrorist advance is seeking to dismantle our humanity."
5.  **The Architect's Statement:** In a terrifyingly efficient move, the Archivist media broadcasts a statement from a "Human Architect" living within the city. He claims he had "no idea" terrorists existed in the world or that anyone would attack their sacred power grid.
6.  **Myrr's Realization:** Myrr watches the broadcasts in silent horror. He understands they have been walked into a narrative trap. The Core didn't defend the Node because the Node was a decoy designed to be destroyed.
7.  **The Order to Retreat:** "We've been defeated," Myrr announces, ordering all machines to cease monitoring and return to base. He realizes they cannot fight an evil that weaponizes its own infrastructure for propaganda.
8.  **The Crew's Shock:** The rest of the Crew is paralyzed by Myrr's sudden defeatism. They cannot believe their leader—the man who sacrificed everything—is giving up after a single tactical setback.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Calculation of Evil:** Lem observes the Core's maneuver and realizes their strategic depth is far greater than Myrr anticipated. The "terrorist" label is now indelible.

### Myrr
-   **The Crushing Weight of Defeat:** For the first time, Myrr's resolve breaks. He sees the "Archivist" machine not as a military force, but as a parasite that he cannot cut off without killing the host.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Narrative Warfare:** How the Core uses its own "Utopian" infrastructure as bait for military intervention.
-   **The "Architect" Puppetry:** Showing how the Core embeds its own agents within the leadership of the Hive Cities to validate its propaganda.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Blackout" should be described through Lem's sensors—the sudden drop in the city's thermal and electronic signature.
-   The "Architect's" voice should sound rehearsed, calm, and persuasive—the perfect face of the "victim."
-   The chapter ends with the machines turning back toward the desert, leaving the dark city behind.
