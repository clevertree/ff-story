# Chapter 22: Ashwood

**Setting:** The Archipelago / Core Command Center
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
On the Archipelago floating islands, Lem meets Cassia, who becomes his guardian and explains the benefits of Core citizenship. She reframes Lem’s capture as a rescue from aliens, marking it as the first of many missions. Lem soon realizes that the Core operates on a fabrication of history—teaching that 1,000 years have passed since the Cataclysm and omitting Lem’s own role in the past. While he becomes an object of intense research due to his unique "drift vessel" capabilities, Lem suppresses his memories of the Before Time. Since he remains silent about his identity, Cassia names him "Ashwood" and prepares him for the next phase of Project Counter Fire: reclaiming the Dead Zone.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Meeting with Cassia:** Lem is introduced to Cassia on the Archipelago; she becomes his guardian and explains the path to citizenship through volunteering for Core missions.
2. **The First Rescue:** Cassia frames Rahu’s destructive capture of Lem as a rescue from "aliens," establishing the official narrative of the Core's benevolent intentions.
3. **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Lem discovers that the Core citizens live in a fabrication where 1,000 years have passed since the Cataclysm, and his own existence has been erased from the history books.
4. **The Drift Curiosities:** As a "drift vessel," Lem is a source of intense fascination for Core scientists because of his unique, unknown capabilities compared to the standard vessels.
5. **Memory Resistance:** Despite the pressure to conform, Lem secretly retains his memories of the "Before Time" and avoids revealing the truth to anyone in the Core.
6. **The Naming:** Recognizing that Lem has no name—and refuses to provide one—Cassia officially designates him "Ashwood," a name reflecting his wooden composition and the ruin of the Fire City.
7. **The Legend of Rahu:** Cassia escorts him to a city museum and containing official archives detailing the "Hero Rahu," the Vessel who supposedly fought the "Witch Maya" twice: once in Year 0 to destroy the Lunar Capacitor, and again in Year 1000 to prevent Earth's destruction.
8. **The Relic of the Moon:** Lem sees a replica of Rahu's sword in the museum; the exhibit claims he used it to deflect Maya's electric attacks and cut through her on the Moon. The **Lamenters** believe the original blade still carries the spirit of the Year 0 sacrifice.
9. **1000 Year Fallacy:** Lem sees a timeline indicating that the current year is 1015, with 1015 years since the Moon Cataclysm began (Year 0), and only 15 years since the Reclamation (reincarnation). The museum explains this duplicate history claiming Maya returned 1000 years later to finish what she started.
10. **The Failed Bloom:** In this narrative, the reincarnation of Rahu and Ajax ended a thousand years of alien occupation, and they are both still alive and leading the human race out of the darkness of the 1000 years of alien occupation.
11. **The Maya-Leaf Hunt:** Lem learns about a religious ritual that parents engage their children in - the **Maya-Leaf Hunt**. Parents hide lab-grown maple leaves (which do not grow naturally in the city or desert) for kids to find and burn. They are told the leaves are "Maya" and must be purged; rewards are given for the largest collection of burnt ash.
12. **The Lamenters (Vessel Religion):** Lem approaches a part of the museum explaining the "Vessel" belief held by 15% of the population. They view Rahu and Ajax as spiritual reincarnations of ancient holy spirits who died in Year 0. While the Core is secular, it permits the **Lunar Lament**—a monthly candlelit service where citizens mourning the moon's loss reject artificial power for natural flame.
13. **Unaligned Religion:** The museum stand concludes by stating that while most citizens see Vessels as advanced technology (85%), the 15% "Lamenter" minority is tolerated. Lem notes that all other indigenous religions are branded as 'tainted software' of the Occupation, including the dangerous 'Maya Cult'.
14. **Synodic Service:** On the way out, Lem watches citizens casually greeting **Gorgon builders** who are installing new housing modules. The people clearly believe the Core has "tamed" the alien monsters into benevolent servants, never suspecting the level of control the Core has always held over them.
15. **Sanitized History:** Lem compares these records to his own persistent memories, noticing that the "Duplicate History" is a perfect gaslight—it validates everything he remembers about the 21st century while burying it under a millennium of non-existent history.
16. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna, if any.
17. **The Paralysis Secret:** He remembers Rahu's paralysis after the aborted Lunar Reset—a detail kept from Rahu himself to ensure his continued obedience, as Rahu lacks Lem's persistence and cannot remember the event easily. Note: Rahu was also subjected to the 'Slow-burn' memory wipe proceedure which reinforces the Core's narrative in Rahu's memory, however this is not revealed in the Museum. 
18. **Project Counter Fire Briefing:** Lem is drafted into Project Counter Fire, which has already moved into its next phase: reclaiming the Dead Zone surrounding the now-defunct Fire City.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The Archipelago consists of multiple topographical fragments stabilized by Core gravitational arrays. I was positioned on the Command Center observation deck. Cassia exited the facility and approached my location. Her attire consisted of silk-composite robes with integrated data-displays. Cassia stated that my recovery was a prioritized operation. She characterized the wild Gorgons as "aliens" that posed a threat to my resonance stability.

Cassia identified the wild units in the desert as an occupying alien force that had suppressed human development for 1000 years. She announced a reclamation project for the Ember Basin. The Core archives designate the current year as 1015 AT (After Time). This chronology asserts that over a millennium has passed since the Lunar Cataclysm. My internal records indicate the actual duration is fifteen years. The Core narrative omits the mission logs from the previous century and identifies me as a "drift vessel" of unknown origin.

Cassia noted my unique memory persistence and rapid reintegration cycle. She stated that these traits were a primary research focus for Core scientists. During a visit to the city museum, I observed educational displays for the "Maya-Leaf Hunt." This activity incentivizes children to locate and incinerate synthetic flora associated with the individual Maya. The museum also displayed a reproduction of Rahu’s primary weapon, identified as the "Blade of Year 0."

The museum narrative utilizes historical names and symbols to construct a revised chronology. Rahu was present in the plaza, surrounded by individuals identified as "Lamenters." This group views Vessels as spiritual reincarnations. Rahu’s biometric data indicated heightened stress. He appeared to have no recollection of the events on the Moon or the "Slow-burn" memory procedure performed by the Core. He functioned according to his assigned role as a hero figure.

Cassia officially designated my unit as "Ashwood." She stated the name was a reference to the Fire City ruins and Core resilience. I accepted the designation and confirmed my participation in Project Counter Fire. This project involves the reclamation of the Dead Zone. I maintained my internal identity as Lem while complying with the research and mission requirements of the Core. I will continue to monitor the discrepancy between the external narrative and my internal data.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The Archipelago was an exercise in celestial hubris—a collection of lunar fragments tethered together by aetheric anchors, hovering in the perpetual twilight of the stratosphere. From the observation deck of the Core Command Center, I watched the distorted curvature of the Earth. It was a world of shadows and industrial scars. Cassia, my designated guardian and a High Archivist of the Core, approached with the measured grace of someone who had never known the weight of gravity.

"Your arrival is a pivot point for the Reconstruction, Ashwood," she announced. Her voice carried the weight of a thousand-year conviction. "You were recovered from the Synodic occupation zones just as the infection was beginning to take hold of your humanoid core."

The narrative was flawless. In the Core’s official record, the Great Fry of Year 0 had triggered a millennium of alien darkness. I was told that humanity had spent a thousand years hiding in the shadows of the "Maya Cult" and the "Gorgon Swarms" before Rahu and Ajax returned to liberate the race in Year 1000. It was a masterful synthesis of fact and fable. They had taken my real history—a mere fifteen years ago—and stretched it into an epic of ancient suffering to justify their current tyranny.

As a "drift vessel," I was a biological anomaly. The Core’s scientists treated me with a clinical reverence that bordered on the religious. They poked and probed my "Wood-resonance," baffled by the persistence of my memory and the stability of my humanoid frame. They did not realize that my stability was a choice—a biological refusal to be "recalibrated" by their machines.

The city of the Archipelago was a temple to this sanitized history. I walked through the archives of the "Hero Rahu," seeing the depictions of his battle with the Witch Maya. The museum displayed the "Lamenter" artifacts—candlelit services for the Moon's loss that the Core permitted to pacify the religious minority. They branded all other faiths as "tainted software" of the Occupation, a convenient way to erase the cultural identity of the survivors.

I witnessed the "Maya-Leaf Hunt"—a grotesque ritual where the youth of the Core were taught to associate the natural beauty of a maple leaf with the "infectious" presence of the Witch. It was a psychological conditioning that turned the very memory of the old world into a target for fire.

"You have no name in our records," Cassia observed as we processed my citizenship volunteer papers. "Since you refuse to provide one, you are designated 'Ashwood.' It is a name of mourning and reconstruction."

I accepted the designation with a silence that they mistook for gratitude. I watched the citizens of the Core casually greeting the "tamed" Gorgon builders in the streets, never suspecting that these "alien monsters" were always their own secret tools. The level of cognitive dissonance required to maintain this society was staggering, yet it was the only reality they knew.

I remembered the Moon. I remembered the screaming halt of the Reset and the cold eyes of Iris Novak as she paralyzed Rahu. But Rahu, standing only a few yards away in the plaza, remembered none of it. He was a victim of the "Slow-burn" memory wipe—a hero whose every noble thought was a script written by the Core. He was a prisoner who thought he was a king.

"Project Counter Fire is entering its operational phase," Cassia briefed me as she led me toward the deployment bays. "We are reclaiming the Dead Zone surrounding your birthplace. You will be the face of the Reconstruction, Ashwood. The people need to see that the Wood Vessel has returned to serve the Core."

I looked at the rebuilt Lunar Capacitor hanging like a metal threat in the sky. I would be their face. I would be their Ashwood. I would be the variable that they could not calculate until it was too late to stop the fire.
