# Chapter 22: Ashwood

**Setting:** The Archipelago / Core Command Center
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
On the Archipelago floating islands, Lem meets Cassia, who becomes his guardian and explains the benefits of Core citizenship. She reframes Lem’s capture as a rescue from aliens, marking it as the first of many missions. Lem soon realizes that the Core operates on a fabrication of history—teaching that 1,000 years have passed since the Cataclysm and omitting Lem’s own role in the past. While he becomes an object of intense research due to his unique "drift vessel" capabilities, Lem suppresses his memories of the Before Time. Since he remains silent about his identity, Cassia names him "Ashwood" and prepares him for the next phase of Mission 2: reclaiming the Dead Zone.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Meeting with Cassia:** Lem is introduced to Cassia on the Archipelago; she becomes his guardian and explains the path to citizenship through volunteering for Core missions.
2. **The First Rescue:** Cassia frames Rahu’s destructive capture of Lem as a rescue from "aliens," establishing the official narrative of the Core's benevolent intentions.
3. **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Lem discovers that the Core citizens live in a fabrication where 1,000 years have passed since the Cataclysm, and his own existence has been erased from the history books.
4. **The Drift Curiosities:** As a "drift vessel," Lem is a source of intense fascination for Core scientists because of his unique, unknown capabilities compared to the standard vessels.
5. **Memory Resistance:** Despite the pressure to conform, Lem secretly retains his memories of the "Before Time" and avoids revealing the truth to anyone in the Core.
6. **The Naming:** Recognizing that Lem has no name—and refuses to provide one—Cassia officially designates him "Ashwood," a name reflecting his wooden composition and the ruin of the Fire City.
7. **The Legend of Rahu:** Cassia escorts him to a city museum and containing official archives detailing the "Hero Rahu," the Vessel who supposedly fought the "Witch Maya" twice: once in Year 0 to destroy the Lunar Capacitor, and again in Year 1000 to prevent Earth's destruction.
8. **The Relic of the Moon:** Lem sees a replica of Rahu's sword in the museum; the exhibit claims he used it to deflect Maya's electric attacks and cut through her on the Moon. The **Lamenters** believe the original blade still carries the spirit of the Year 0 sacrifice.
9. **1000 Year Fallacy:** Lem sees a timeline indicating that the current year is 1015, with 1015 years since the Moon Cataclysm began (Year 0), and only 15 years since the Reclamation (reincarnation). The museum explains this duplicate history claiming Maya returned 1000 years later to finish what she started.
10. **The Failed Bloom:** In this narrative, the reincarnation of Rahu and Ajax ended a thousand years of alien occupation, and they are both still alive and leading the human race out of the darkness of the 1000 years of alien occupation.
11. **The Maya-Leaf Hunt:** Lem learns about a religious ritual that parents engage their children in - the **Maya-Leaf Hunt**. Parents hide lab-grown maple leaves (which do not grow naturally in the city or desert) for kids to find and burn. They are told the leaves are "Maya" and must be purged; rewards are given for the largest collection of burnt ash.
12. **The Lamenters (Vessel Religion):** Lem approaches a part of the museum explaining the "Vessel" belief held by 15% of the population. They view Rahu and Ajax as spiritual reincarnations of ancient holy spirits who died in Year 0. While the Core is secular, it permits the **Lunar Lament**—a monthly candlelit service where citizens mourning the moon's loss reject artificial power for natural flame.
13. **Unaligned Religion:** The museum stand concludes by stating that while most citizens see Vessels as advanced technology (85%), the 15% "Lamenter" minority is tolerated. Lem notes that all other indigenous religions are branded as 'tainted software' of the Occupation, including the dangerous 'Maya Cult'.
14. **Synodic Service:** On the way out, Lem watches citizens casually greeting **Gorgon builders** who are installing new housing modules. The people clearly believe the Core has "tamed" the alien monsters into benevolent servants, never suspecting the level of control the Core has always held over them.
15. **Sanitized History:** Lem compares these records to his own persistent memories, noticing that the "Duplicate History" is a perfect gaslight—it validates everything he remembers about the 21st century while burying it under a millennium of non-existent history.
16. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna, if any.
17. **The Paralysis Secret:** He remembers Rahu's paralysis after the aborted Lunar Reset—a detail kept from Rahu himself to ensure his continued obedience, as Rahu lacks Lem's persistence and cannot remember the event easily. Note: Rahu was also subjected to the 'Slow-burn' memory wipe proceedure which reinforces the Core's narrative in Rahu's memory, however this is not revealed in the Museum. 
18. **Mission 2 Briefing:** Lem is drafted into Mission Counter Fire, which has already moved into its next phase: reclaiming the Dead Zone surrounding the now-defunct Fire City.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The Archipelago was a surreal mosaic of floating rocks, suspended in a permanent twilight by the artificial gravity of the Core. I stood on the balcony of the Command Center, watching the clouds swirl beneath us like a turbulent sea of grey and violet. Behind me, the doors hissed open, and Cassia stepped out. She didn't look like a scientist; she looked like a curator of souls, dressed in robes of silver silk that shimmered with integrated data-streams.

"It took us a long time to find you, Ashwood," she said, her voice smooth and practiced. "You're lucky Rahu reached you before the aliens did. Those Gorgons would have eventually consumed your resonance."

"Aliens," I repeated, the word tasting like ash in my mouth. 

"The monsters in the desert," she clarified, joining me at the rail. "They've been occupying the Earth for over a millennium, hoarding resources and suppressing human potential. But the Core is back now. We're reclaiming our heritage, starting with the Ember Basin."

I looked at her, searching for any sign of a lie. But she believed it. They all did. In the archives of the Archipelago, the current year was 1015 AT. They taught the children that a thousand years had passed since the Moon Cataclysm, a dark age where humanity was hunted by the "Witch Maya" and her alien swarms. My own memories—of the mission to the Moon just fifteen years ago, of the failed reset, of the day the world actually broke—had no place in their history books. I was a "drift vessel," a mystery from a time they had chosen to bury under a mountain of fake history.

"You have a unique gift," she continued, placing a hand on my shoulder. I felt the faint hum of my Wood-element resonance responding to her touch, a rhythmic vibration that I fought to suppress. "You don't just reincarnate; you persist. We've never seen anything like you. You're a source of intense fascination for our scientists."

She escorted me through the city museum. I saw posters for the "Maya-Leaf Hunt," a game where kids were given points for finding and burning synthetic maple leaves. "Target: The Witch," the signs read. I saw a replica of Rahu's sword, the "Blade of Year 0," which he supposedly used to slay Maya on the Moon. It was a perfect gaslight. They had taken the bits and pieces of the truth—the real names, the real symbols—and woven them into a lie so thick that even Rahu believed it.

"He doesn't remember," I thought, looking at Rahu across the plaza. He was surrounded by "Lamenters"—citizens who viewed him as a spiritual reincarnation of an ancient saint. Rahu looked uncomfortable, his eyes fixed on the horizon. He didn't know about the paralysis on the Moon. He didn't know the Core had wiped his mind with a "Slow-burn" procedure. He was a hero who didn't know he was a puppet.

"We're naming you Ashwood," Cassia said, writing the name into my digital file. "It suits you. Born from the ruins of the Fire City, a testament to the Core's resilience."

"I'll be your Ashwood," I whispered. I would play the role. I would volunteer for their "Mission 2" to reclaim the Dead Zone. I would be the "drift vessel" they wanted to study. But beneath the silver and the wood, I was still Lem. I was the only person left on the planet who knew the truth, and I would wait. I had all the time in the world.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The Archipelago was an exercise in celestial hubris—a collection of lunar fragments tethered together by aetheric anchors, hovering in the perpetual twilight of the stratosphere. From the observation deck of the Core Command Center, I watched the distorted curvature of the Earth. It was a world of shadows and industrial scars. Cassia, my designated guardian and a High Archivist of the Core, approached with the measured grace of someone who had never known the weight of gravity.

"Your arrival is a pivot point for the Reconstruction, Ashwood," she announced. Her voice carried the weight of a thousand-year conviction. "You were recovered from the Synodic occupation zones just as the infection was beginning to take hold of your humanoid core."

The narrative was flawless. In the Core’s official record, the Great Fry of Year 0 had triggered a millennium of alien darkness. I was told that humanity had spent a thousand years hiding in the shadows of the "Maya Cult" and the "Gorgon Swarms" before Rahu and Ajax returned to liberate the race in Year 1000. It was a masterful synthesis of fact and fable. They had taken my real history—a mere fifteen years ago—and stretched it into an epic of ancient suffering to justify their current tyranny.

As a "drift vessel," I was a biological anomaly. The Core’s scientists treated me with a clinical reverence that bordered on the religious. They poked and probed my "Wood-resonance," baffled by the persistence of my memory and the stability of my humanoid frame. They did not realize that my stability was a choice—a biological refusal to be "recalibrated" by their machines.

The city of the Archipelago was a temple to this sanitized history. I walked through the archives of the "Hero Rahu," seeing the depictions of his battle with the Witch Maya. The museum displayed the "Lamenter" artifacts—candlelit services for the Moon's loss that the Core permitted to pacify the religious minority. They branded all other faiths as "tainted software" of the Occupation, a convenient way to erase the cultural identity of the survivors.

I witnessed the "Maya-Leaf Hunt"—a grotesque ritual where the youth of the Core were taught to associate the natural beauty of a maple leaf with the "infectious" presence of the Witch. It was a psychological conditioning that turned the very memory of the old world into a target for fire.

"You have no name in our records," Cassia observed as we processed my citizenship volunteer papers. "Since you refuse to provide one, you are designated 'Ashwood.' It is a name of mourning and reconstruction."

I accepted the designation with a silence that they mistook for gratitude. I watched the citizens of the Core casually greeting the "tamed" Gorgon builders in the streets, never suspecting that these "alien monsters" were always their own secret tools. The level of cognitive dissonance required to maintain this society was staggering, yet it was the only reality they knew.

I remembered the Moon. I remembered the screaming halt of the Reset and the cold eyes of Iris Novak as she paralyzed Rahu. But Rahu, standing only a few yards away in the plaza, remembered none of it. He was a victim of the "Slow-burn" memory wipe—a hero whose every noble thought was a script written by the Core. He was a prisoner who thought he was a king.

"Mission 2: Counter Fire is entering its operational phase," Cassia briefed me as she led me toward the deployment bays. "We are reclaiming the Dead Zone surrounding your birthplace. You will be the face of the Reconstruction, Ashwood. The people need to see that the Wood Vessel has returned to serve the Core."

I looked at the rebuilt Lunar Capacitor hanging like a metal threat in the sky. I would be their face. I would be their Ashwood. I would be the variable that they could not calculate until it was too late to stop the fire.
