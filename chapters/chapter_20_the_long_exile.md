# Chapter 20: The Long Exile

**Timeline:**
1. Rahu's presence in the forest; observation from the shadows.
2. Departure into the deep wilderness; abandoning the machine network.
3. Evolution of Lem's aetheric body without external "updates."
4. Sudden resonance of "Maya Match" – a clue from his original existence.

**POV:** Lem


## Draft
With no orders, I watched the local weather, seeing the snow accumulate and melt on a single branch. I watched the fire patterns on the horizon and tracked where the smoke came from.

Remaining in the area to avoid detection, I monitored the expansion of the Fire Cities and saw where new smoke columns appeared. I kept track of broken machinery and which villages were still occupied.

I stayed in one location and watched everything around me.

## Synopsis
Solitude and observing Rahu's influence from the shadow of the forest.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
