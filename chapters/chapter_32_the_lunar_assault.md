**POV:** Lem

**Timeline:**
1. **The Solo Launch:** Lem launches in the Antares II shuttle, carrying the weight of the fallen Vessels.
2. **The Debris Graveyard:** Navigating the ruins of the 2020s space race alone.
3. **Lunar Lightning:** Navigating the static discharges without a Water-resonance guide.
4. **The Phasing:** Lem uses the remaining "Maya-shards" to briefly phase the shuttle.
5. **The Final Entry:** Landing on the lunar surface and entering the cold, air-filled Pyramid.

## Synopsis
Lem launches into orbit using the Mission 3 "Antares II" shuttle, but he is alone. He navigates a graveyard of human history in orbit, seeing the wreckage of the old world. Without Maya to guide him, he has to rely on the "Liquid Shards" she left behind—remnants of her resonant energy—to "phase" the ship through the Lunar Pyramid's shields. He crash-lands on the lunar surface and enters the Pyramid, finding the interior a perfectly preserved time capsule of the 21st century.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The *Antares II* was a relic of a world that didn't know it was about to die, and now I was its only passenger.

The cockpit was a claustrophobic tangle of analog switches and cathode-ray tubes. It smelled of scorched insulation and recycled sweat. I sat in the pilot's seat, my wooden fingers stiff on the heavy steel yoke. Beside me, the co-pilot's seat was empty, save for a small glass vial containing the shards of silver stone that had been Maya.

They didn't pulse anymore. They were just gray fragments, cold to the touch. But as we broke orbit, I could feel a faint, persistent vibration coming from the glass.

Space was a graveyard.

Fragments of the orbital war drifted past the cockpit glass—shattered satellites, frozen pieces of space stations, and the drifting carcasses of the first-generation Fire Vessels. I saw the hull of *Rahu 1.0*, spinning aimlessly in the void. It felt like passing through the memory of a dead civilization.

"Initiating approach," I whispered. My voice was the only sound in the ship.

The Moon was no longer a silver disk. It was a jagged tooth of black obsidian, miles high, rising out of the Gray Plain. The Lunar Pyramid was drinking the sun, and white arcs of static discharge—Lunar Lightning—jumped between the apex and the lunar dust.

The black glass pulsed.

A sphere of concentrated plasma—a white sun—erupted from the lunar surface. It streaked toward the shuttle, trailing a wake of ionized fire.

I looked at the vial of shards. 

I didn't have Maya's grace. I didn't have her command over the Water. But I had her memory. I reached out and touched the glass, closing my eyes. I didn't try to fly the ship. I tried to *feel* it. 

I channeled the Wood resonance into the shards. For a second, the gray stone turned violet. The shuttle didn't shift like a ripple; it groaned as its atomic structure was strained to the limit. We staggered through the air, the hull turning translucent as if we were a poorly tuned television signal.

The plasma beam passed through the fuselage. The heat was real—I could feel the sap in my arms beginning to boil—but the impact never came. 

We slammed into the regolith a hundred yards from the Pyramid's base. The landing struts snapped with a sound like a rifle shot. I was thrown forward, my head hitting the console. 

When I opened my eyes, the cockpit glass was gone. But I wasn't suffocating. The air was cold and thin, held against the lunar surface by the Pyramid's own gravity well.

I climbed out of the wreckage. I held the vial of shards to my chest. 

The walls of the Pyramid loomed over me—shifting, geometric cliffs of black glass. The main entrance was a simple airlock, identical to the ones on the 20th-century space stations. There was a sticker on the door, faded and peeling: *PROPERTY OF THE LUNAR ARCHIVE UNIT.*

I stepped inside. The air smelled like a data center in winter—cold, dry, and heavy with ozone. It was the smell of the world I had been born to replace.

I was alone, but the ghosts were everywhere.

## Character Arc
### Lem
- **The Sole Envoy:** He carries the physical remains of the Water Vessel, fulfilling the mission for both of them.
- **The Hybrid Pilot:** He learns to use the residues of other elemental powers.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Aetheric Residue:** The idea that a Vessel's energy can persist in physical fragments (shards).
✅ **Property of the Lunar Archive Unit:** The surviving label from the original terrestrial mission.

## Revision Notes
- The "13+" punch is the physical pain of phasing without a proper Vessel.
- Maintain the isolation and the weight of the "dead" companion.
- End on the haunting familiarity of the airlock.
