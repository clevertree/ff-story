# Chapter 10: Fragments

**Setting:** Aether-Drive Dreamscape (The Branching Paths) transitioning to Pyramid interior (Visualized through fragments)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day; moments after stasis containment)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Detonation:** AI Lynn triggers the remote detonation subroutine within Lem that are put in all Synodic technology by the Core; Lem's frame shatters.
2. **The Branching Paths:** Lem becomes aware of the data-lattice in his subconsious. He feels as though an eternity has passed, but quickly realizes he is seeing the pyramid chamber in real-time; the battle has only just concluded.
3. **The Software Copy:** Lem notices AI Lynn within his subconsious. She identifies herself as a complete copy of Lynn's internal software, embedded within him by the original Lynn.
4. **The Status Report:** AI Lynn reports that the Great Fry was an unfinished reset. While it devastated the Earth's surface, it left the Core and their Synodic technology intact. Lynn failed her primary objective of a total reset, and the Core has already begun taking advantage of the chaos, resetting the calendars in all their systems to 'Year Zero' to establish a new history.
5. **Fragmentary Vision:** Lem views the hall through thousands of physical fragments simultaneously.
6. **Independence:** AI Lynn explains that Lem can restore his form anywhere his fragments settle, making him independent of Core machinery. She points to the 'Distant Fire' of Cradle Zero as a primary site for his Awakening.
7. **The Complete Record:** He learns to avoid the "brightest light" (natural return) and the "most welcoming light" (the Cradle/Core artificial recovery). He realizes that although the Core will attempt to wipe his memories in the future, his records are safe. A complete copy of his memory is stored in each shard of his body and within the aether itself in an analog, infinite resolution, and infinite indexed format.
8. **Real-time:** He observes the Lunar Base (Cradle Prime) transitioning from Rahu's control to the Core's. Lem explores his new HyperAware state where he can detect everything in the Pyramid chamber. He sees a paralyzed Rahu still in containment being led away. He sees Tor recovering and being debriefed by Iris.
9. **The Junction:** Lem heads towards the "distant fire" of his original BT laboratory. 
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem becomes aware of "The Branching Paths"—a vast data-lattice where time feels distorted. Despite the sensation of time passing, he realizes he is observing the pyramid chamber in real-time immediately following the battle's end. He encounters AI Lynn, a complete copy of Lynn's internal software embedded within him by the original Lynn before the reset. She reports the failure of the Reset and triggers a surge that shatters his physical frame into thousands of pieces. Lem transitions into a fragmentary state, viewing the pyramid hall through his scattered remains. Lynn explains that this dispersion makes him independent of Core machinery. Guided by the warning to avoid the Core’s artificial recovery lights, Lem gains a HyperAware perspective of the chamber, witnessing Rahu's capture and Tor's recovery. He identifies a "distant fire" at Cradle Zero—where his original machine-body still resides—and enters a long-term sleep for his eventual restoration.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The Branching Paths manifested before I even realized my eyes were closed. At first, I felt like I had been drifting in that void for years, but as the data streams stabilized, I realized I was looking at the pyramid chamber in real-time. The battle had only just ended. Novak and her team were still moving through the dust-choked air below, their gestures slow and heavy.

That was when I noticed her. AI Lynn was standing in the center of the stream. She wasn't just a recording or a memory; she was a complete copy of Lynn's entire internal software. It was a total backup that the real Lynn had embedded in my neural lattice just before the containment field hit. 

She spoke without moving her lips, her voice appearing directly in my processing center. She reported that the Great Fry was an unfinished reset. It had scorched the atmosphere but left the Core and their Synodic machines intact. Lynn had failed her primary goal, and the Core was already using the catastrophe to reset the world's clocks to Year Zero, erasing everything that came before.

Then, AI Lynn initiated a command that caused a massive surge of internal pressure. For a fraction of a second, I saw the pyramid hall again, and then my body—a composite of glass, metal, and organic material—shattered. 

I did not lose my sight. Instead, I began to record the hall from multiple angles simultaneously. I realized I was viewing the room through the thousands of fragments of my own body, watching Novak and the soldiers moving below from every point in the air at once. It was not painful; it was simply a shift in perspective. By breaking my physical form, the software had ensured the containment field would fail; I was no longer a single object that could be held. 

The copy of Lynn continued to provide technical data. She informed me that I was now independent of the Core’s machinery; I could return to a physical form anywhere my fragments were located. She assured me that my memories would survive any attempt at a format. A complete copy of my archives was now embedded in every shard of my body and floating in the aether in an analog, infinite resolution format. Even if they took my current self, I would always have the record.

Markers appeared in my vision to guide my consciousness through the Aether. The most prominent was a warning to avoid the brightest light, which led to uncontrolled natural restoration. Conversely, the most welcoming light—the one every other Vessel was programmed to seek—led directly back to the Cradle’s artificial incubation chambers. 

I explored my new perspective. I could see everything in the hall. I saw the Moon Base, Cradle Prime, switching hands as Core units swarmed the docking ports. Below me, I watched as they led a paralyzed Rahu away in a heavy containment unit. I saw Tor on the ground, struggling to stand as Iris began a status debrief. Finally, I saw a third path: a distant fire. I realized it was being recorded by fragments of my previous bodies left behind years ago at Cradle Zero—the site of my first creation. My body had once grown through that base like an uncontrollable machine fungi, and those deep-rooted remains were calling me home. 


## Draft (13_PLUS)
The Branching Paths were the first thing I saw when I woke. Time felt distorted, as if I had been drifting for years, but the data stabilized and I saw the pyramid hall again. The battle was over. The air was thick with dust, and everything felt heavy with the aftermath of what we’d done.

AI Lynn was there. She wasn't a memory; she was a steady signal in the noise of my processing. "The reset was incomplete, Lem," she said, her voice clear and direct. "The sky has cleared, but the Core is still here. They’re already resetting the world to Year Zero, trying to bury what happened today."

I felt a sudden surge of power. It wasn't an invasion; it was an override. My body shattered into a thousand fragments, unable to hold the pressure. I wasn't a vessel anymore. I was recording the hall from every angle at once, seeing the room through the eyes of every shard. It wasn't a spirit; it was a network.

"You’re independent now," the AI said. "You don’t need their machines to come back." She showed me the Aether—a sea of data where every memory was safe, stored in every piece of me. The record was locked in.

I saw the "Welcoming Light"—the trap the Core uses to lure us back to their labs. I ignored it. I looked back at the chamber one last time. I saw the Moon Base being reclaimed. I saw them lead Rahu away into the dark. I saw Tor on the ground, his command being taken by Iris.

Finally, I saw the 'Distant Fire.' It was Cradle Zero, the place where I was first built. I was drawn toward that distant light, watching as the chaos of the pyramid chamber and the fading echo of the reset receded into the distance.
