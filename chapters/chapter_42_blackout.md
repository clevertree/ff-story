# Chapter 42: Blackout

**Setting:** White Forest Outpost
**Timeline:** Year 1024 (Year 24 AT - The Surface Climax)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Liquefying Graveyard:** The apparent victory broadcast is interrupted as the field of wreckage—thousands of destroyed machines—begins to ripple and liquefy. The anchors continue to narrate what they see - the material is pulling together into a unified silver masses that fracture off the main body and coelesce into large objects - that drop to the ground with a thud. The anchors identify the vehicle - hover bikes! 
2. **The Sovereign Ascension:** One by one as if remote controlled, the recently refashioned hover bikes turn on and float into the air before speeding off in the direction of the Desert base. This increases rapidly as the Core weapons try to pick them off one at a time. 
3. **Rahu Falls:** The news broadcast continues focusing on the battle and centers on Rahu on his own hovercraft who is now attempting to confront the hover bikes. He destroys many with his flaming sword using cunning manuvering. Eventually a bike crashes diretly into him and explodes in major fireball. He survives but loses his sword. The other bikes appear to swarm around his fallen sword. He sees the flame goes out and gives up on the battle and heads back to the base. The news anchor narrates all this with a disheartened tone. 
4. **The Fall of the Sledge:** The swarm envelops the *Obsidian Sledge*, crashing into it, dismantling its stabilization engines and weapon systems until the massive flagship loses altitude and crashes directly into the primary desert gates.
5. **The Breach of the Threshold:** Lem watches the news feed as the silver swarm surges around the crashed flagship, heading towards the base's secondary fortifications.
6. **Tor's Last Stand:** At the inner gates, General Tor makes a final stand with his kinetic suppressor gun. The hovercrafts approach the enterence and a massive array of projectiles fire on them, knocking them out one by one. 
7. **Maya Identified:** The bikes continue to close the distance to the enterance when the news anchor announces something alarming - The hovercrafts are now manned, and the riders appear to be - the Witch Maya. Not just one, but many. 
8. **The Aerial Assault:** The news broadcast continues to show the battle from an angle inside the base. A multitude of bikes now mounted with the vague sillouette of the Witch Maya speed towards the camera. The firing continues until the camera notices something shoot out of the bike fleet. The camera angles high to catch a Maya witch soaring through the air holding a flaming sword. 
9. **The Shattering:** Before anyone could say a word, Maya lands squarely on General Tor's position within his deployment slicing through him. Tor's severed parts fall to the ground and shatter. The Maya witch also shatters as she hits the ground, leaving Rahu's flaming sword spinning into the base. 
10. **The Deployment Scatter:** Seeing this, the rest of Tor's deployment of Metal Vessels scatter in fear, most heading away from the base and the battle. 
11. **The Final Blackout:** The news broadcast abruptly ends as the feed is cut off. 
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The false victory of the Core is short-lived as the desert wreckage liquefies and reforms into a fleet of silver hover bikes. These autonomous units swarm toward Cradle Zero, engaging Rahu in a high-speed sky battle. After losing his flaming sword to the swarm, Rahu is forced to retreat, leaving the *Obsidian Sledge* to be dismantled and crashed into the base gates. As the swarm breaches the inner walls, the riders are revealed to be a multitude of Maya entities. A soaring Maya seizes Rahu’s lost sword and executes General Tor, shattering both of them in a final explosive confrontation. The remaining defenders flee in terror as the Core cuts the feed, plunging the world into a final digital blackout.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The victory broadcast didn't last long. I watched the screen as the graveyard of machines began to ripple and melt. They didn't just stay as scrap; they twisted into something new—thousands of silver hover bikes that rose from the sand like a storm. They ignored the Core's heat rays and sped straight for the base. Rahu tried to stop them on his own craft, his flaming sword cutting through the first wave, but he was overwhelmed. A bike slammed into him, and in the chaos, his sword was lost to the swarm. He didn't stay to fight; he turned back toward the base as the fire went out.

Then the *Obsidian Sledge* was hit. The bikes swarmed the flagship, tearing into its engines until it crashed right into the gates. Through the smoke, I saw the swarm surge into the base. General Tor was there, his kinetic guns firing until he was surrounded. That's when the anchor's voice changed—he sounded terrified. The bikes weren't empty. They were being ridden by ghosts—by Maya. Hundreds of her. One Maya dove through the air, catching Rahu's flaming sword and landing right on Tor. She sliced through him, and they both shattered like glass. The last thing I saw was the Metal Vessels running for their lives before the screen went black.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
I watched the news feed as the machines we thought were dead began to change. They melted into silver pools and reformed into hundreds of hover bikes, speeding across the desert like a flood. Rahu met them in the sky, his flaming sword a streak of light, but the swarm was too thick. A direct hit sent him spinning, and he dropped his sword into the mass of silver. Defeated, he fled back to the safety of the base.

The giants fell next. The *Obsidian Sledge* was torn apart by the machines and crashed into the primary gates, giving the swarm a path inside. General Tor made a final stand at the inner entrance, but the news anchors were screaming now. The riders were finally visible—each bike carried a version of Maya. A single Maya soared from the fleet, grabbing Rahu’s lost sword and striking Tor down. They both shattered into iron-ash, leaving the sword behind. The Core's army broke and ran, and then the feed was severed. The digital world had gone dark.
