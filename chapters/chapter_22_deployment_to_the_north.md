# Chapter 22: Deployment to the North

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Desert Base Hangar → High Altitude → Northern Forest Landing Site

---

## Outline / Summary

The briefing ends and the deployment begins instantly. Lem is ordered onto a **Large Hover Jet Craft**, a massive, black-slotted vessel that defies conventional physics. As the engines ignite, Lem's Aether-Drive hums in sympathetic resonance. He feels the "Mission HUD" activate in his vision—glowing cyan objectives, teammate markers, and a countdown to "Tactical Airflow."

The craft launches into the smog-choked sky, quickly reaching Mach 3+. Inside the hold, Lem stands among dozens of human soldiers and silent Metal Vessels. Lia Vane's voice remains a constant presence in his ears, providing updates on atmospheric conditions and the "imminent threat" to the villagers. In less than an hour, the desert heat of Cradle Zero is replaced by the biting cold of the northern hemisphere.

As they descend through the clouds, Lem sees the "Gorgon Pods" for the first time—brittle, crystalline structures that have impacted the soft forest floor, creating massive craters. Lia informs the group that these are the result of lunar fragments shedding debris, and it is their duty to protect the "innocent villagers" from the horrors that will crawl out of them.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Fascinated and repelled by the HUD. He feels the remote control "checking" his motor cortex, like a pilot testing a plane's controls.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Experiencing the Mach 3+ traversal and the transition from desert to forest.
    2. Feeling the "HUD" and remote control influence for the first time.
    3. Seeing the impact sites and the "invading" pods.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Hover Jet Technology:** High-speed, Synodic-derived transport.
✅ **Mission Interface:** Direct contact with operators and the visual HUD.
✅ **Gorgon Pods:** Their physical appearance and origin from the Moon fragments.
✅ **Atmospheric Contrast:** The difference in planetary conditions post-Fry.

## Notes & Spoilers

- **Internal Spoiler:** The Gorgon pods were tracked by the Core long before impact; the choice to send Lem *now* is a test of his physical abilities and loyalty.
