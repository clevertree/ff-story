# Chapter 21: Recalibrated

**Setting:** Cradle Zero / Refashioned Archivist Laboratory
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Following the explosion of his Gorgon body, Lem reforms into his humanoid Wood Vessel state, a phenomenon that shocks the Metal and Fire Vessels. Vector identifies him as a "drift vessel" and attempts an interrogation, but Lem remains silent, viewing them as invaders. Despite Vector’s desire to paralyze the new discovery, Rahu advocates for bringing him to Cassia. Lem is escorted to a ship and flown to the Archipelago—a collection of floating moon fragments orbiting the shattered moon. During the flight, Lem observes that the Core has nearly finished rebuilding the Lunar Capacitor, replacing missing lunar sections with industrial metal.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Broken Fire:** Rahu, having taken the brunt of the blow, struggles to rise with his lead suit cracked and melted onto his scorched body.
2. **The Drift Vessel:** Vector ignores the injured Rahu to analyze Lem, finding no existing record of a fifth Vessel in any archive.
3. **The Silent Rebirth:** Lem, conscious but unresponsive, refuses to answer the invader's interrogation, thinking only of the destroyed the Fire City he helped create.
4. **The Command Conflict:** While Vector prepares to paralyze Lem, Rahu intervenes, arguing that Lem is not a threat and that Cassia will want to meet him.
5. **Rahu's Leverage:** Despite Vector being in charge, he yields to Rahu, whose status as the only Fire Vessel grants him significant independence within the command structure.
6. **Departure:** As Rahu recovers and removes his broken gear, Lem notices the Fire Vessel's resilience; despite the damage, Rahu shows no sign of physical impairment.
7. **The Archipelago Flight:** They escort Lem onto their ship and fly toward a nearby floating island—part of the Archipelago of moon chunks orbiting the central Primary Chunk.
8. **The Rebuilt Lunar Capacitor:** For the first time in decades, Lem sees the sky and realizes the Core has nearly restored the circular Moon, replacing missing rocks with metal to rebuild the Lunar Capacitor.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I felt the fire before I felt my own skin. The explosion of my Gorgon shell was a roar that still echoed in my ears, but as the heat dissipated, I felt the familiar weight of my own limbs. My fingers dug into the scorched floor of the Fire City, the wood of my body cooling from a glowing orange to its natural, deep grain. I was back in the shape of a boy, but I felt like an ancient tree.

"Impossible," a voice said. It was cold, clinical.

I looked up. Vector stood over me, his metallic form reflecting the dying embers of the city. Behind him, Rahu was a mess of cracked lead and burnt carbon, leaning heavily on his sword. The smell of scorched metal and ozone was thick in the air. I didn't say anything. I just watched them. I thought of the Gorgons that had been my people for fifteen years—the ones who clicked and rattled and dreamed of a place where they could just exist. They were gone now, scattered into the red sands of the Ember Basin or paralyzed by the Core's cruel commands. These invaders were the monsters the Core had sent to reclaim a world they didn't deserve.

"Interrogative: Identity and origin," Vector commanded. His eyes were glowing orbs of data-processing light.

I remained silent. How could I explain fifteen years of silence? How could I tell them I was the architect of the very walls they were currently tearing down? 

"He's a drift vessel," Vector concluded, his sensors scanning me with a laser-like intensity. "An unindexed variable. No records in the Lunar archives. I'm initiating the stasis protocol to secure the asset."

"No," Rahu stepped forward, his voice a rasping growl through his damaged suit. He reached up and tore away a piece of the melted lead, revealing a face that was as hard and unyielding as the mountains. "He's not a threat. Look at him. He's just... lost. Cassia will want to see this. She's been looking for signs of independent Synodic evolution."

Vector hesitated. In the hierarchy of the Core, Vector was the machine, the enforcer. But Rahu was the hero, the "Prometheus" of their propaganda. There was a weight to his words that even the hive mind had to respect. He was the Fire Vessel, and without him, the Core's power on Earth was limited. 

"Very well," Vector said, his voice buzzing with a slight static of annoyance. "Prepare him for transport to the High Enclave. But if he moves, I will personally see him dismantled."

They escorted me to their ship, a craft of sleek, predatory lines that looked like a silver needle. For the first time in fifteen years, I felt the sensation of flight that wasn't a dream. As we breached the cloud layer and the smog of the Basin fell away, I saw it. The Moon.

It wasn't the shattered ruin I remembered from the night of the Cataclysm. It was a perfect circle again, but it was hideous. Half of it was the silver-grey rock of the old world, but the rest was a geometric cage of industrial metal—a massive capacitor that hummed with a power that felt like a localized sun. The Core hadn't just returned; they had rebuilt their chains. They were rebuilding the Lunar Capacitor, and the world below was once again under its gaze.

The transition from the violent heat of the detonation to the heavy, cool air of the square was instantaneous. I was no longer a Gorgon; I was the Wood Vessel, my humanoid frame knitting itself back together from the silverized splinters of my previous shell. I knelt on the scorched stone, feeling the first, sharp in-breath of lungs that had not tasted air in fifteen years. The Fire City was a graveyard around me, its resonance silenced by the transponder that still hummed in the distance.

Vector stood over me, a monument to the Core’s surgical precision. He did not seem surprised so much as intrigued, his sensors pulsing with a deep-frequency interrogation. Behind him, Rahu was a shattered statue. The front of his lead isolation suit had been peeled back by the force of my explosion, revealing the intricate, fire-veined structure of the Vessel beneath. He did not look like a conqueror; he looked like a victim of his own power.

"Drift Vessel detected," Vector’s voice was a synthesis of a thousand commands. "Query: Identify your manufacturer and your mission parameters."

I did not answer. My mind was still filled with the rattling language of the Gorgons, a language that these "High" Vessels would never understand. I saw them as the ultimate pollutants—the parasites that had come to strip the Earth of its new, independent soul. 

"The subject is unresponsive to standard interrogation," Vector observed. "Initiating paralysis for transport to the reclamation labs."

"Stay your hand," Rahu commanded. He spoke with the authority of the original fire, and even Vector bowed his head. Rahu stood between us, his scorched skin already beginning to heal with a terrifying speed. "He is not an asset for the labs. He is a discovery. Cassia has been theorizing about the existence of a 'Wood Prime' for decades. We bring him to the Archipelago."

The conflict between them was a delicate balance of logic and legend. Vector represented the hive’s immediate tactical needs, but Rahu was the anchor of their mythology. Vector yielded, his metallic joints clicking in a gesture of forced compliance.

"Transport will be facilitated," Vector acknowledged. "But his signature will be monitored for any sign of aetheric surge."

I was escorted to their craft, a sleek, aether-driven vessel that bypassed the friction of the atmosphere with effortless grace. As we ascended, the scope of my failure was revealed. From above, the Fire City was nothing more than a spark in the vast, red desert of the Ember Basin. 

But it was the sky that truly chilled me. The Moon, once a shattered witness to our defeat, had been remade. The Core had spent fifteen years rebuilding the Lunar Capacitor, filling the gaps with industrial scaffolding and massive panels of aetheric-absorbent metal. It was a Frankenstein’s monster of rock and machine, a perfect circle that promised a new era of total surveillance. The Great Fry had been a temporary setback; the Core was now preparing for the Final Reset.
