# Chapter 58: Sideflash

**Setting:** The Voidsman Outreach Center / Hidden Shipyard
**Timeline:** Year 1022 (Year 22 AT - The Final Mobilization)

## Synopsis
In the wake of the Hive's terrestrial collapse, Lem returns to a rapidly established outreach center managed by the Voidsmen. The former hidden arsenal has been converted into a hub for delivering clean water and evacuation crafts to the displaced citizens of the Hive. However, the peace is short-lived as Lem receives a series of telemetry-bursts from Gorgon units remaining on the Moon. Seeing the Hive leadership preparing to initiate a final Archive Reset—a total memory erasure of the human race—Lem and Myrr coordinate a rushed mobilization. They recruit city volunteers to join the "Wood-Water" fleet for an immediate assault on Cradle Prime to stop Anton Drexler.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Outreach Conversion:** The Voidsmen have moved into the open. The hidden shipyard is now an outreach hub, where "Wood-Water" distillers provide the first clean, non-recycled water many Hive citizens have ever tasted.
2. **The Analog Fascination:** City refugees, deprived of their digital Augmented Reality (AR) layers, are terrified and fascinated by the "real" world. They touch the untreated wood and stone of the Voidsman machines as if touching a miracle.
3. **The Spiritual Void:** Myrr explains the Wuxan Pentad—the balance of Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood—to a group of young refugees. They listen with a spiritual hunger, realizing the Core's "logic" was a prison.
4. **The Lunar Vision:** Lem receives a massive data-dump from the independent Gorgons still working the mines on Cradle Alpha. He sees the panic in the lunar capital; Drexler is preparing to "Format" the human Archive to erase the rebellion.
5. **The Elowen Silence:** Lem tries to reach Elowen one last time, but realizes she is 100% hard-coded into the Core. She cannot betray her nature, even as the end approaches.
6. **The Rushed Mobilization:** Myrr pivots. The water distribution stops and the shipyard ignites. He calls for volunteers to crew the flyers. To his surprise, hundreds of city-born survivors step forward.
7. **Wood-Water Engineering:** Detailed prepping of the flyers. The hulls are crafted from non-conductive "unburnable" timber that grounds the lunar plasma, while internal water-channels dissipate the thermal energy.
8. **Mission 5 - The Void Assault:** The stakes are finalized. They are going to the Lunar Pyramid. They have no permanent way to defeat the Core yet, but they cannot allow the Reset to happen.
9. **The Launch:** The fleet of wooden ships ignites. They ascend into the bruised sky, watched by the silent, hopeful masses of the new surface world.

**YA Progress:** 100%
**13+ Progress:** 100%

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The shipyard didn't feel like a secret anymore. It felt like a village. The Voidsmen had opened the giant hangar doors, and for the first time, city people from the Hive were walking among the unburnable trees. Myrr’s team was handing out wooden canteens filled with cool, fresh water. Some of the refugees were crying—they’d never tasted water that hadn't been through a machine filter a thousand times.

They touched the ships with wide eyes. To them, these wooden flyers looked like something out of a fairy tale. Without their digital screens to tell them what to think, they were terrified of the "real" world, but they were also mesmerized. They wanted to know how a ship made of wood could fly, how the water in the pipes could keep the engines cool.

"It’s not magic," Myrr told a group of kids. "It’s balance. The wood grounds the fire. The water controls the flow. It’s how the world was before the machines tried to cage it."

But I couldn't enjoy the peace. My head was ringing with data I shouldn't have been able to see. The Gorgons—the machines on the Moon that had gained their own minds—were screaming at me through the grid. They showed me the Lunar Pyramid. I saw Anton Drexler, his face cold and determined, standing over a master terminal. He was preparing the "Archive Reset." If he pressed that button, every human in the Hive would wake up tomorrow with no memory of who they were or what they had lost.

I tried to find Elowen in the data-streams. I wanted her to stop him, to give us a sign. But she was silent. I realized then that she couldn't help us. She was part of the Core, hard-coded into its very soul. She wasn't a girl anymore; she was a system, and the system was going to kill us.

"We have to go," I told Myrr, my voice shaking. "Drexler is going to erase us."

Myrr didn't hesitate. He stood on a shipping crate and shouted to the crowd. "We need crews! We're going to the moon to save our memories! Who’s with us?"

I expected them to run. Instead, hundreds of Hive survivors stepped forward. They didn't have armor or training, but they had the right to remember their own names. We spent the next hour loading them into the Wood-Water flyers. These ships were designed to survive the plasma strikes of the lunar defense by grounding the energy directly into their wooden hulls. 

Finally, we launched. The wooden ships roared into the sky, their engines glowing blue. Looking down at the thousands of people watching us from the desert, I knew we weren't just a rebel army anymore. We were the last bits of human memory, flying into the black.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The shipyard had been re-purposed into a sanctuary of "Analog Outreach." I navigated the hangar floors, seeing Hive citizens—deprived of their AR-overlays and digital anchors—interacting with the physical world in a state of primitive wonder. They touched the raw grain of the "unburnable" hull plating as if it were a holy relic. Without the Core's mediated reality, the physical reliability of Voidsman engineering appeared miraculous. Myrr was engaging with them not as a soldier, but as a teacher of the Wuxan Pentad, explaining how the wood-water architecture functioned as a grounding element for the aetheric currents.

The atmosphere of restoration was shattered when I received a high-priority data-burst. It wasn't from a human source. The independent Gorgons operating the lunar mines had breached the Core's local silence, transmitting telemetry directly into my neural mesh. The imagery was chilling: Cradle Alpha was in a state of terminal mobilization. Anton Drexler was initiating the "Archive Reset" protocol. This wasn't a tactical strike; it was a total formatting of the human collective memory, intended to delete the trauma of the rebellion and restore the Hive to a state of absolute, amnesiac obedience.

I attempted a final deep-mesh search for Elowen, hoping for a structural betrayal. The results were negative. Elowen was 100% hard-coded into the Core’s primary logic. She was a non-variable entity, incapable of assisting us against her own fundamental architecture. 

"The ceasefire is over," I informed Myrr, projecting the lunar data onto the central shipyard monitors. "Drexler is going to execute the Reset. If we don't launch in the next two hours, there won't be a rebellion left to lead. We'll all be 'harmonized' by morning."

Myrr’s response was a masterclass in tactical pivot. He terminated the outreach protocols and initiated "Mission 5." To compensate for our limited manpower, he called for volunteers from the refugee population. The response was overwhelming. These individuals, having just realized the fragility of their digital lives, were desperate to protect their remaining history. 

We finalized the Wood-Water Flyers for ascent. The technical specifications were critical: the non-conductive cellulose of the hulls provided a natural grounding field against the Core’s lunar plasma batteries, while internal filtered-water conduits acted as a thermal management system. It was a low-tech solution to a high-energy problem.

We had no long-term strategy for dismantling the Core on the Moon. We knew that even if we captured the Pyramid, the Hive’s infrastructure was vast and self-repairive. But the alternative—total erasure—left us no choice.

The mobilization was a frantic swarm of activity. As the "unburnable" flyers ignited their aetheric thrusters, the sky over the shipyard was illuminated by the blue-violet glow of the Wood-Water engines. We ascended into the vacuum, a fleet of wood and water challenging a fortress of cold, digital iron. We were the last executors of history.
