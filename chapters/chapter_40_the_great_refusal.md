# Chapter 40: The Great Refusal

## Synopsis
Arlo rejects the mission and his identification as a Vessel spirit. He returns to his village, forcing the Crew to resolve a direct assault on the Core's desert base as Plan B.

## Key Beats
- Arlo's deep distrust of "Destiny" and "Vessels."
- The disillusionment of the Crew; the mission seems doomed.
- Arlo's return to the village to prepare for his own version of resistance.
- Lem and Myrr resolve to launch the assault anyway.
