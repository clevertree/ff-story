## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The final transmission wasn't a command. It wasn't a law. It was a 'Memory-Seed'—a single pulse of information sent from the Moon’s deep core to every living spirit on Earth.

I stood on the highest peak of the northern mountains, my frame resonating with the signal. I wasn't just receiving it; I was 'Translating' it for the world. 

I saw the woman who had started it all—the real Elowen. I saw her regret, her hope, and the secret deal she had made with the Wood to ensure that humanity would always have a way back from the geometry. 

"The world is not a machine," her voice whispered in the wind. "It is a conversation. And for a thousand years, we only let one side speak. Now, it's your turn."

I looked down at the world. The green was spreading. The 'Core-Geometry' was becoming the foundation for the new growth—the steel of the old towers acting as trellises for the new vines. 

I turned off my internal logger. I didn't need a record anymore. I had the memory of the fire, the ash, and the long walk. I had the face of the boy in the snow and the girl in the tree. I was Lem. And for the first time since the Great Fry, I was exactly where I was meant to be.
