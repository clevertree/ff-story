# Chapter 71: The Siege of Pods

**Objective:** Massive orbital assault; Lem transforms and defeats Rahu.

**Key Events:**
- Continuous launch of pods from the Moon fragments targeting the outer ring of the villages.
- An invading army of multi-legged Tripods and Monoliths strikes both from the perimeter and inside the circle (inner forest).
- Epic battle between White Forest machines and the Core's expansionist force.
- Rahu enters the fight in camouflage, methodically destroying the defense.
- Lem enters a "dream state" and realizes the potential of his Spirit-matter; he absorbs his vehicle and transforms into a pure Spirit-matter form.
- Lem defeats Rahu, shattering his blade and trapping him in a stasis field (similar to the Moon Cataclysm).
