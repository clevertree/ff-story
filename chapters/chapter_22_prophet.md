# Chapter 22: Prophet

**Setting:** Ridge overlooking the Northern Valley
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Forbidden Buoys:** Lem observes the valley through Myrr’s long-range optics. The five villages are now encircled by "Forbidden Buoys"—pulsing Core pillars that monitor for any advanced kinetic or electronic signatures. The villagers are clearly unhappy with the intrusion, but they have no means to remove the machines.
2. **The False Protection:** Myrr explains that the Core justifies the buoys as a defense against the "alien" Gorgon striders. The villagers are caught in a deceptive trap: the Core controls the monsters and then offers the buoys as the only way to track them.
3. **The Prophet’s Voice:** From their hidden position, Myrr plays back intercepted audio of Arlo’s sermons. Arlo’s voice has deepened, carrying a weight of authority that surprises Lem. He is no longer the stuttering boy from the village square; he is the voice of their collective survival.
4. **The Oral Tradition:** In the sermons, Arlo teaches that their refusal of technology is not a new rebellion, but the preservation of a "First Way" passed down through generations since the beginning of time. He speaks of it as an oral tradition that was never meant to be written or digitized, kept alive by the "Mountain People." Myrr notes that this is the same indigenous religion and solar-lunar calendar followed by the White Forest, despite the technological schism between them.
5. **Universal Harmony:** Arlo informs his followers that their way of life is cross-referenced by other indigenous tribes around the globe. He frames the current era of technology as a temporary sickness and nature as the only permanent reality.
6. **The Tactical Lock:** Myrr admits that his team is useless in this environment. Their analog armor and pulse-rifles are viewed by the villagers as just another form of "The Sickness"—a betrayal of the very First Way they claim to protect. They cannot even approach the perimeter without triggering a violent response from the very people they want to save.
7. **The Unarmed Envoy:** Myrr proposes that Lem enter the village alone. In his minimalist analog frame, and without any weapons or armor, Lem is the only one who might be perceived as "clean." Lem agrees to go, hoping the "Maya Resonance" within him can reach the boy he once knew.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
From a high ridge, Lem and Myrr observe the five villages under the shadow of Core "Forbidden Buoys." Myrr reveals that Arlo has successfully transformed the villages into a unified front of religious resistance based on oral traditions and indigenous wisdom—the same spiritual roots as the White Forest survivors. However, because the villagers view the White Forest’s technology as a betrayal of their shared faith, Myrr’s team is unable to approach. Lem agrees to enter the village unarmed, acting as an envoy to speak with the "Prophet Arlo."

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
We sat on the high ridge, looking down at the valley through Myrr’s long-range optics. The five villages were encircled by Core "Forbidden Buoys"—monolithic pillars of black glass that pulsed with a low, vibrating menace. They looked like giant, angry needles stuck in the earth, monitoring for any sign of advanced technology. Myrr told me the Core justified the buoys as protection against "monsters" like the Gorgons, but it was a trap: the Core controlled the monsters and then offered the buoys as the only way to track them.

But the villages weren't giving up. Myrr played me intercepted audio of Arlo’s sermons. I couldn't believe it was the same kid. His voice was deep and steady, carrying the weight of a man who had lived several lifetimes. He wasn't talking about gadgets or power; he was preaching about a "First Way." He taught his people that their oral traditions were more authentic than any digital archive because they couldn't be hacked or erased. 

"He's using the same religion we follow," Myrr whispered, his voice tight. "The same calendar, the same prayers. But he says our analog tech is just a different color of the sickness. He thinks we've traded our souls for wooden armor."

I looked at Myrr’s heavy, living-wood armor and his glowing pulse-rifle. "They won't let you in, will they?"

"To them, we're worse than the Core," Myrr admitted. "We're the cousins who betrayed the Earth. We can't even get past the perimeter without triggering a fight because they think our presence poisons the soil."

I looked at my own hands. I was minimalist, made of crystal and fiber-optics, but I didn't carry a weapon. "I might be seen as 'clean,'" I said.

Myrr nodded. "You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see the man instead of the machine."

I didn't like the idea of walking into a village full of people who hated technology, especially since I was the most advanced thing on the planet. But if Arlo was the only one who could reach the truth about the "Thousand-Year Fallacy," I had to try. I agreed to go, hoping the "Maya Resonance" still lived somewhere inside him.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
From the high ridge, the valley below looked like a garden strangled by thorns. The Core had planted their "Forbidden Buoys"—monolithic pillars of black glass—around the perimeter of the five villages. They hummed with a low, vibrating menace, a net of shadows that watched every movement. Myrr told me the Core called them shields against the Gorgons, but it was a lie as old as time: create the monster, then sell the cage.

Yet, inside that cage, a new song was rising. We crouched in the brush and listened to the echoes of Arlo’s voice, carried upward by the wind and the rhythmic chanting of the villagers. The boy was gone. In his place was a man who spoke with the weight of mountains. He sang of the "First Way," a path of living that existed before the first word was ever carved into stone or etched into a circuit. 

“He is speaking our own prayers,” Myrr whispered, his eyes fixed on the distant fires. “He follows the same sacred calendar, the same ancestral law that we carry in the forest. But he calls our tools a betrayal. He tells his people that our analog waves are just another flavor of the disease that killed the old world. He is proving that to him, we are no longer kin.”

The truth was a bitter pill for Myrr. He and his warriors were as welcome in that valley as the Core itself. To the villagers, their living wood armor and pulse-rifles were just a different color of corruption—a sickness of the soul that had traded purity for protection.

“You are the only one who can walk through the gate,” Myrr said, laying a hand on my wooden shoulder. “You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive, no steel in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see you as a brother of the earth who still remembers the First Way. They might see the man instead of the machine.”

The walk into the valley would be a walk into a fire of judgment. I was an analog child, a creature born of both the forest and the forge. I agreed to go, hoping that the small spark of the boy I once knew still lived beneath the Prophet’s iron will.
