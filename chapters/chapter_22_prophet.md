# Chapter 22: Prophet

**Setting:** Ridge overlooking the Northern Valley
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Forbidden Buoys:** Lem observes the valley through Myrr’s long-range optics. The five villages are now encircled by "Forbidden Buoys"—pulsing Core pillars that monitor for any advanced kinetic or electronic signatures. The villagers are clearly unhappy with the intrusion, but they have no means to remove the machines.
2. **The False Protection:** Myrr explains that the Core justifies the buoys as a defense against the "alien" Gorgon striders. The villagers are caught in a deceptive trap: the Core controls the monsters and then offers the buoys as the only way to track them.
3. **The Prophet’s Voice:** From their hidden position, Myrr plays back intercepted audio of Arlo’s sermons. Arlo’s voice has deepened, carrying a weight of authority that surprises Lem. He is no longer the stuttering boy from the village square; he is the voice of their collective survival.
4. **The Oral Tradition:** In the sermons, Arlo teaches that their refusal of technology is not a new rebellion, but the preservation of a "First Way" passed down through generations since the beginning of time. He speaks of it as an oral tradition that was never meant to be written or digitized, kept alive by the "Mountain People" who lived outside the Hive’s reach.
5. **Universal Harmony:** Arlo informs his followers that their way of life is cross-referenced by other indigenous tribes around the globe. He frames the current era of technology as a temporary sickness and nature as the only permanent reality.
6. **The Tactical Lock:** Myrr admits that his team is useless in this environment. Their analog armor and pulse-rifles are viewed by the villagers as just another form of "The Sickness." They cannot even approach the perimeter without triggering a violent response from the very people they want to save.
7. **The Unarmed Envoy:** Myrr proposes that Lem enter the village alone. In his minimalist analog frame, and without any weapons or armor, Lem is the only one who might be perceived as "clean." Lem agrees to go, hoping the "Maya Resonance" within him can reach the boy he once knew.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
From a high ridge, Lem and Myrr observe the five villages under the shadow of Core "Forbidden Buoys." Myrr reveals that Arlo has successfully transformed the villages into a unified front of religious resistance based on oral traditions and indigenous wisdom. Because the villagers distrust the White Forest’s technology as much as the Core’s, Myrr’s team is unable to approach. Lem agrees to enter the village unarmed, acting as an envoy to speak with the "Prophet Arlo."

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
We sat on the ridge, looking down at the valley. There were glowing towers—Core buoys—all around the villages. They looked like giant, angry needles stuck in the earth. Myrr told me they were there to "protect" the people from the Gorgons, but everyone knew it was just another way for the Core to keep them in a cage.

But the villages weren't giving up. Myrr played me some recordings of Arlo speaking. I couldn't believe it was the same kid. He sounded like a king. He was telling stories about the old world—not the one with computers, but the one before that. He said their way of life was passed down by people who lived in the mountains and caves, people who never let the Hive take their souls.

"He’s telling them they aren't alone," Myrr whispered. "He says there are tribes all over the world who believe the same thing. He says nature is the only thing that’s real."

I looked at Myrr’s heavy armor and his glowing rifle. "They won't let you in, will they?"

"They’d kill us before we hit the first gate," Myrr admitted. "To them, we’re just a different kind of monster. But you... you look like them, almost. If you go in with nothing in your hands, Arlo might listen. He might remember you."

I didn't like the idea of walking into a village full of people who hated machines, especially since I was one. But if Arlo was the key to stopping the Core, I had to try.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
From the high ridge, the valley below looked like a garden strangled by thorns. The Core had planted their "Forbidden Buoys"—monolithic pillars of black glass—around the perimeter of the five villages. They hummed with a low, vibrating menace, a net of shadows that watched every movement. Myrr told me the Core called them shields against the Gorgons, but it was a lie as old as time: create the monster, then sell the cage.

Yet, inside that cage, a new song was rising. We crouched in the brush and listened to the echoes of Arlo’s voice, carried upward by the wind and the rhythmic chanting of the villagers. The boy was gone. In his place was a man who spoke with the weight of mountains. He sang of the "First Way," a path of living that existed before the first word was ever carved into stone or etched into a circuit. 

“He is weaving their souls together,” Myrr whispered, his eyes fixed on the distant fires. “He tells them that their refusal is not a rebellion, but a return. He speaks of the Hidden Tribes, the people of the high peaks who never let the Hive touch their hearts. He is proving to them that the machine is just a fever, and they are the cure.”

The truth was a bitter pill for Myrr. He and his warriors were as welcome in that valley as the Core itself. To the villagers, their living wood armor and pulse-rifles were just another form of the Sickness—a different color of corruption. Even the best intentions were poisoned by the hum of a battery.

“You are the only one who can walk through the gate,” Myrr said, laying a hand on my wooden shoulder. “You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive, no steel in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see you as a brother of the earth. They might see the man instead of the machine.”

The walk into the valley would be a walk into a fire of judgment. I was an analog child, a creature born of both the forest and the forge. I agreed to go, hoping that the small spark of the boy I once knew still lived beneath the Prophet’s iron will.
