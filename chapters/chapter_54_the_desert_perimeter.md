**Setting:** The Forward Base / Desert Frontier
**Timeline:** Year 25 AT (Mission 5 - Plan C)
**POV:** Lem
**Estimated Length:** 3,500–4,000 words

---

## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Schism of Plan C:** Back at the camp, Myrr is defiant in his withdrawal, but the Crew refuses to quit. "With or without you," they tell him. They decide on **Plan C**: a direct assault on the main desert base, **Cradle Zero**.
2.  **Abandoning Optics:** The Crew no longer cares about the "terrorist" label. The damage is done. They resolve to dismantle the base and avoid casualties, but they will not stop until the leadership is disabled.
3.  **Lem's Calculation:** Lem calculates that the Core's primary resources are tied up in the Hive Cities and Nodes. Mobilizing its full force would theoretically break the Core's own "Utopia" narrative—a mission victory in itself. 
4.  **Massive Mobilization:** They commit 50% of their total tree arsenal. The machines that were returning from the Node mission are redirected. 
5.  **The Horizon Line:** A huge perimeter of standing monoliths and smaller vehicles forms in a curve, 10 to 50 miles outside the desert base. The scale of the "Wood and Water" army is finally visible on the desert plain.
6.  **The Signal to Strike:** Lem signals the command. The machines begin their advance across the valley toward the heart of the Core's terrestrial power.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **Numerical Certainty:** Lem's confidence is built on the relative exhaustion of the Core's terrestrial resources. 

### Myrr
-   **The Silent Captain:** Though he argued to quit, Myrr ultimately joins the Crew, his presence heavy and resigned as the assault begins.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Cradle Zero's Perimeter:** The vast, desolate valley surrounding the Core's headquarters.
-   **Resource Tethering:** The concept that the Core's power is spread thin by the very cities it uses to control humanity.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Line of Monoliths" on the horizon should be a breathtaking image—rows of biological-mechanical giants standing silently against the orange desert sky.
-   The mood is one of grim finality; there is no more testing, only the strike.
