# Chapter 1: Transmission


**Setting:** Lem's suburban home; Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Early), Years before Cataclysm

## Synopsis
Lem begins his record by detailing the nature of his memories—an analog stream beginning before his birth. He recalls a childhood of institutional routine and unexplained relocations, a sign of the Core's early influence on his path. He then traces the root of the coming conflict to 1971, when the Apollo 14 mission seeded the first Synodic toxins into the lunar surface under the guise of exploration. Finally, he describes the "discovery" of the Lunar Base through amateur signal leaks, a staged cultural phenomenon that split the world and set the stage for the Core's takeover.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Lem's Transmission / The Record of Senses:** Lem outlines the start of his memories to the recipients of the transmission. He notes that his analog memory contains the complete record of his vision and senses and begins abruptly around 9 months prior to his birthdate, although the input doesn't become clear for a long time - until around 5 months after he was born.
2. **The Institutional Routine / Genetic Anonymity:** He doesn't remember meeting his parents and knows nothing about them. Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine at the orphanage. He always remembers being called Lem, but has no idea who named him.
3. **The First Relocation / 3rd Grade Transition:** Lem went to school, but after a few years he would be moved from one to another in a different state. The reasons varied. The first time he was relocated happened in the 3rd grade mid-year was due supposedly due to his exceptional grades. He realized later that they had never actually asked him if he wanted to move. Instead they just informed him how lucky he was.
4. **The Second Relocation / 6th Grade Safety:** The 2nd time Lem moved was in the 6th grade. This time no apparent reason was given, however during a stern conversation with one of his handlers, he was told that the city he lived in was no longer safe, without providing any more context. Again he didn't resist the move, not having really been given a choice. Each time he moved he'd make a new set of friends.
5. **TODO: finalize Lem timeline**
6. **The Root of the Conflict / The 1971 Shards:** Lem summarizes the 1971 mission logs—the Apollo 14 impact and Dr. Vane’s terrestrial Synodic research.
7. **The False Discovery / Staged Leaks:** Amateur signal trackers break news of an "Alien Moon Base." In reality, these leaks were staged by the Core to justify their coming military coup.
8. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
9. **Culture of the Base / The Phenomenon:** Over several years, the news becomes a cultural divide. Neighborhood children begin playing "Tripod," mimicking the loping gait of the entities described in the leaks.
10. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
11. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
12. **The Transition of Normalcy / Neighborhood's Slow Breath:** Life remains superficially ordinary, but the tenor changes—curtains drawn, neighbors vanishing, and a constant hum of news bulletins in empty houses. Lem feels oddly detached from the growing panic.
13. **The Dissociative Generation:** Youth adoption of "tripods want to be left alone" stance and "deep-state whistleblower" conspiracy theories (Rahu) to cope with fear.
14. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
15. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

These are my memories. I am starting from the first thing I can remember and taking it through the five missions I was part of, up to the moment I send this transmission. I have tried to stick to the facts and keep my own opinions out of it. This story is a record of my memory, ending with the broadcast itself. The data is terminal, a final mission log preserved from the Before Time and the Core Technocracy. I want people to know the truth about the history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—what the Archive Transcripts call the Project Alpha activation—so these mistakes are not repeated.

I remember my childhood as a series of routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of the orphanage. My memory is pragmatic and sparse. It starts with a gap, followed by the abrupt start of my consciousness in a suburban setting. I did not have a family, so my days were all about timetables. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a beginning.

The first transition happened in the 3rd grade. I was told my grades were too good for the local school, and before I could even pack my toys, I was on a bus to another state. It happened again in the 6th grade, this time for "safety." My handler, a man named Mr. Henderson who never looked me in the eye, told me the city wasn't safe anymore. I didn't argue. I just moved. By the time I was fifteen, I had lived in six different cities, each one a little quieter than the last.

The conflict did not start in my lifetime. It began in February 1971, when the Apollo 14 mission intentionally crashed a booster into the Moon. The impact was not just for seismic data; it was the delivery system for the first shards. The Moon’s Far Side had once belonged to a forgotten people—the Selenites—but the 1971 infection changed everything. Dr. Elowen Vane had spent the previous two decades developing Synodic technology in a terrestrial lab. The Core used the Apollo mission to seed this toxin into the ancient lunar structures, allowing them to seize control of the base that would later be known as Cradle Prime.

The shift began slowly, with amateur radio leaks. Amateur signal trackers broke news of an Lunar Base on the far side, hidden from Earth’s view. We did not know then that the Core was staging these leaks themselves, baiting the trap to justify their coming military coup. At first, it was just something for people on late-night forums to obsess over, parsing grainy telescope footage. But over the years, the news became a cultural phenomenon that split the world.

I remember watching the neighborhood children in the afternoons. They had turned the news into a game, mimicking the heavy, loping gait of the entities described in the leaks—the "Tripods." The youth adopted a stance that the tripods just wanted to be left alone. Some of the older kids even started talking about Rahu, a supposed deep-state whistleblower who was going to save us. To the younger ones, it was just a new way to move their bodies.

The sensory impact of those days was subtle. The weather was always a little too warm, the air tasting faintly of copper. The ambient noise of the city was replaced by a low, constant hum from the power lines. I remember the roses in our garden blooming twice in a single summer, their petals a dark, unnatural red. Even the stray cats seemed to have changed, their eyes reflecting more light than they should have.

Life remained superficially ordinary, but the tenor changed. Curtains were drawn, and neighbors began to vanish. I remember a woman named Mrs. Gable who lived next door; she used to wave every morning. Then one day, her house was just empty. No moving truck, no goodbye. Just a television set left on in her living room, tuned to a channel of static.

Core propaganda started appearing on the bus stop posters: *A New Horizon Awaits. Trust the Process.* It was the first time I saw the logo of the Core, though I didn't know what it meant then.

I remember meeting a group of elders from the nearby reservation during one of my supply runs. They didn't seem scared at all. While the news anchors were screaming about "aliens" and the "end of history," the elders just nodded and looked at the sky. They told me that the stars hadn't changed, and neither had the true count of the seasons. They said the cities were built on a foundation of noise, and the noise was finally being turned off. At the time, I didn't understand, but they knew the truth long before the rest of us. They were watching the transition of normalcy with a calm I could only envy.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

History isn't just a record of the past; it's a living shadow. My name is Lem, and I am a witness to the final days of the world I called home. I was born into a silence that felt like peace, never realizing that the sky above was gathering its strength for a storm that would unmake us all. This is the first transmission—the record of a journey into the heart of a cosmic mystery.

My early years were defined by the steady, rhythmic pulse of the city. I lived in an orphanage of gray stone and sun-drenched gardens, where time was measured in laughter and lessons. We felt safe. We felt permanent. We watched the news as the first anomalies appeared—signal leaks from the Moon that whispered of a hidden history. The world called them 'alien,' and we looked to the stars with a mix of wonder and dread. 

The presence on the Moon became a global fixation. On the streets, children turned the rumors into legends. They mimicked the sightings beneath the massive oaks, their bodies reflecting the heavy, powerful gait of the phantoms they’d seen on grainy satellite feeds. They didn't see monsters; they saw giants. And we, the adults-to-be, sat on our porches and watched the radio, waiting for the sky to speak.
