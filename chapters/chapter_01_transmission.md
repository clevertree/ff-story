# Chapter 1: Transmission


**Setting:** Lem's suburban home; Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Early), Years before Cataclysm

## Synopsis
Lem begins his record by detailing the nature of his memories—an analog stream beginning before his birth. He recalls a childhood of institutional routine and unexplained relocations, a sign of the Core's early influence on his path. He then describes the discovery of the Lunar Base through amateur signal leaks, an unprecedented global event that split the world and set the stage for the Core's takeover.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Lem's Transmission / The Record of Senses:** Lem outlines the start of his memories to the recipients of the transmission. He notes that his analog memory contains the complete record of his vision and senses and begins abruptly around 9 months prior to his birthdate, although the input doesn't become clear for a long time - until around 5 months after he was born.
2. **The Institutional Routine / Genetic Anonymity:** He doesn't remember meeting his parents and knows nothing about them. Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine at the orphanage. He always remembers being called Lem, but has no idea who named him.
3. **The First Relocation / 3rd Grade Transition:** Lem went to school, but after a few years he would be moved from one to another in a different state. The reasons varied. The first time he was relocated happened in the 3rd grade mid-year was due supposedly due to his exceptional grades. He realized later that they had never actually asked him if he wanted to move. Instead they just informed him how lucky he was.
4. **The Second Relocation / 6th Grade Safety:** The 2nd time Lem moved was in the 6th grade. This time no apparent reason was given, however during a stern conversation with one of his handlers, he was told that the city he lived in was no longer safe, without providing any more context. Again he didn't resist the move, not having really been given a choice. Each time he moved he'd make a new set of friends.
5. **TODO: finalize Lem timeline**
6. TODO: Describe the emerging 'Core Technocracy' bubbling to the surface just in time to meet the alien threat. 
7. **The Discovery / Amateur Signal Leaks:** Amateur signal trackers break news of an "Alien Moon Base." This news paralyzes existing governments and makes the Core's rise seem like an global necessity.
8. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
9. **Culture of the Base / The Phenomenon:** Over several years, the news becomes a cultural divide. Neighborhood children begin playing "Tripod," mimicking the loping gait of the entities described in the leaks.
10. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
11. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
12. **The Transition of Normalcy / Neighborhood's Slow Breath:** Life remains superficially ordinary, but the tenor changes—curtains drawn, neighbors vanishing, and a constant hum of news bulletins in empty houses. Lem feels oddly detached from the growing panic.
13. **The Dissociative Generation:** Youth adoption of "tripods want to be left alone" stance and "deep-state whistleblower" conspiracy theories (Rahu) to cope with fear.
14. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
15. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
This is the initial transmission of my recorded sensory data. The logs cover five mission deployment cycles leading to this broadcast. This data-dump is categorized as a terminal mission log from the pre-Technocracy era. These records document the sequence of events preceding the "Moon Cataclysm," designated in Archive Transcripts as the "Project Alpha" activation.

My early developmental records consist of standardized institutional routines: scheduled nutrient intake, educational rosters, and orphanage structural maintenance. Analog data begins abruptly around nine months prior to my biological birthdate. Input resolution stabilizes approximately five months post-natal. My primary identifiers and origin data are not available in localized memory.

A series of relocations was initiated by external handlers. The first transfer occurred during the 3rd-grade academic cycle, citing high-performance metrics. A secondary transfer occurred during the 6th-grade cycle, citing regional security risks. Between ages 10 and 15, I was repositioned across six distinct urban sectors. The relocations were not initiated by the subject.

Public awareness of the lunar base began via coordinated data-leaks to amateur radio-trackers. These leaks were categorized by panic-stricken governments as unidentified signals which normalized the presence of a lunar force. The information became a global cultural phenomenon, frequently discussed in public data-networks.

Social behavior in residential sectors adapted to the news. Juvenile populations mimicked the motor-patterns of the reported lunar entities, designated as "Tripods." A subset of the youth population adopted a non-confrontational stance regarding the lunar presence. Public speculation about a whistleblower designated as "Rahu" began to circulate within the "Dissociative Generation."

Onboard sensors recorded an increase in average terrestrial temperatures and copper-particulate concentrations in the atmosphere. Ambient acoustic data recorded a low-frequency hum from high-voltage transmission lines. Flora exhibited non-standard growth cycles, including bi-annual bloom-events. Fauna exhibited heightened ocular reflectivity.

Residential patterns shifted. Data indicates a 12% increase in localized neighbor-absenteeism. Household structures were observed in an abandoned state, frequently with active media equipment broadcasting baselines or static signals.

The Core Technocracy insignia appeared on public transit signage. Marketing copy emphasized themes of "New Horizons" and "Mission Trust."

Personnel from a nearby terrestrial reservation observed the pre-cataclysm transition with minimal stress-response. They reported stability in celestial and seasonal metrics. They categorized urban sectors as high-noise environments undergoing a termination-cycle. I recorded their observations regarding the transition of normalcy.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

History isn't just a record of the past; it's a living shadow. My name is Lem, and I am a witness to the final days of the world I called home. I was born into a silence that felt like peace, never realizing that the sky above was gathering its strength for a storm that would unmake us all. This is the first transmission—the record of a journey into the heart of a cosmic mystery.

My early years were defined by the steady, rhythmic pulse of the city. I lived in an orphanage of gray stone and sun-drenched gardens, where time was measured in laughter and lessons. We felt safe. We felt permanent. We watched the news as the first anomalies appeared—signal leaks from the Moon that whispered of a hidden history. The world called them 'alien,' and we looked to the stars with a mix of wonder and dread. 

The presence on the Moon became a global fixation. On the streets, children turned the rumors into legends. They mimicked the sightings beneath the massive oaks, their bodies reflecting the heavy, powerful gait of the phantoms they’d seen on grainy satellite feeds. They didn't see monsters; they saw giants. And we, the adults-to-be, sat on our porches and watched the radio, waiting for the sky to speak.
