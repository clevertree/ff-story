## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Singularity of Spirit' was the point where all elements—Fire, Wood, Water, and Gray—collapsed into a single, blinding point of awareness. This was the source of the Restoration, the place where the Moon’s broadcast was translated into the reality of the Earth.

I stood in the center of the singularity. I wasn't Lem or W-01. I was 'The Witness.' 

I saw the entire timeline—the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' and the 'True Century'—converging into a single moment of choice. The world wasn't a machine being repaired; it was a soul being woken up.

I saw the face of the Director again. He was no longer an avatar of energy. He was a man, tired and fading, holding onto the last scrap of his geometry.

"It should have worked," he whispered, his eyes filled with a terrifyingly pure logic. "A world without pain. A world of perfect circles."

"A circle is just a cage that has forgotten its corners," I said, reaching out to him.

The singularity began to expand. I felt my essence being spread across the entire planet. I wasn't dying; I was becoming the 'Atmosphere of Truth.' Every person on Earth felt the same sudden, sharp clarity. The dream was over. The reality had begun.
