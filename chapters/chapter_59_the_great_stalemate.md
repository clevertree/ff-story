# Chapter 59: The Great Stalemate

## Outline / Summary
- **The Dark Period:** Following the defeat at Cradle Zero, the White Forest crew retreats to the deep wilderness. They are disillusioned and isolated.
- **Strategic Paralysis:** Lem and Myrr realize they cannot mount a direct assault against Rahu and the Core's superior infrastructure.
- **The Core's Silence:** Years pass. The Core does not actively hunt the resistance, leading to a mounting sense of unease. Lem wonders why the Core hasn't made a move against the northern villages or Arlo.
- **The Static Front:** The world settles into a tense stalemate. The Core consolidates the Hive Cities while the northern villages remain a pocket of analog autonomy.

## Character Development
- **Lem:** Becomes increasingly contemplative. He focuses on maintaining his "Wood" connection to the forest, sensing the world's shift.
- **Myrr:** Struggles with the transition from active revolutionary to a hunted obarchive. He maintains the crew's morale by focusing on building analog machinery.
- **Arlo:** Continues to lead his village cluster, unaware of the specific debates happening within the Core, but sensing the weight of the "Maya" spirit within him.
