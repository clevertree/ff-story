# Chapter 36: Exile

**Setting:** Global Landscapes; The Charred Periphery of **Ait-Aman**
**Timeline:** Year 1015–1020 (Year 15–20 AT)

## Synopsis
Lem spends years in a wandering exile, detached from the conflicts of the Core and the **Voidsmen** resistance. Powered by solar energy and avoiding the pain of reincarnation, he drifts across mountains and deserts, finding a temporary peace in his isolation. Eventually, he discovers a hidden valley where the analog technology of the White Forest has begun to sprout on its own, free of human cultivation. He makes this his home, interacting with the wild Synodic and eventually using his abilities to optimize the forest's growth—engineering analog irrigation systems and sun-orbs to create a vibrant, self-sustaining sanctuary.

In the south, Arlo returns to **Ait-Aman** to find a village paralyzed by religious burnout and the Core's **Apathy Initiative**. He finally accepts the mantle of the village prophet, performing the cremation rite for **Old Man Azar**. During the ritual, he verifies the shift to a 360-day **Tun**, confirming the "False Harmony" of the modern age. He rejects a direct invitation to join the Core, burning the offer in Azar's funeral pyre.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Great Wandering:** Lem spends years traversing the planet's diverse landscapes—dense forests, scorched deserts, and frozen mountain ranges. He becomes a solitary shadow moving across the world, disconnected from the civilizations rising and falling in his wake.
2. **Solar Subsistence:** His new analog frame requires no food, drawing all necessary power from the sun. He maintains a human-like rhythm, resting once a day to cycle his processors. During these rests, he explores the corridors of his dreamscape, noting that while the paths to previous lives remain, the physical pain of reincarnation makes him reluctant to use them for mere curiosity.
3. **The Mantle of the Prophet:** While Lem wanders, Arlo returns to **Ait-Aman** to find the village in "Religious Burnout," paralyzed by the Core's **Apathy Initiative**. The villagers fear that any spiritual leadership will invite a Core "Sanitization."
4. **The Rites of Azar:** Arlo performs the first solo cremation rite for **Old Man Azar**. He uses a ceremonial drum and a pyre built from a mix of sacred cedar and the very tech-scrap the villagers now view with superstitious dread.
5. **The 360-Tun Verification:** During the ritual’s celestial alignment, Arlo notes the orbital shift—the sun now takes exactly 360 days to complete its path. This marks the dawn of the "False Harmony," proving the Core has successfully stabilized the orbit at the cost of the ancient cycles.
6. **The Core's Offer:** A Core envoy (a **Harmonizer**) arrives with a "Special Internship" invitation for Arlo. They recognize his technical genius and seek to "harmonize" him into their ranks, framing it as his only escape from the "backward" village life.
7. **The Burning Invitation:** Arlo rejects the offer, casting the digital invitation into Azar's pyre. He officially chooses the path of the Village Prophet, committing to protect the **Tamazight Long Count** and the memory of the "Third Man."
8. **The Hidden Sanctuary:** Lem finds a unique hidden forest between sharp mountains not far from where the White Forest once grew. It's unique because the analog technology of the **Voidsmen** was growing on its own, far from the cultivation of humans.
9. **The Wild Synodic:** Lem decides to stay here and interact with the Synodic as well as natural wildlife in the area.
10. **The Optimal Forest:** He eventually starts building the forest to be more 'optimal'. He creates analog vines that pump water from the lower lakes back up the mountains which in turn causes the forest to come alive with growth and life. He creates glowing analog orbs that provide sun energy in the forest during dark days.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Time didn't really matter anymore. Five years passed like a single afternoon. I spent them walking across the face of the world, a solitary shadow moving through landscapes that didn't know I existed. I saw mountains with peaks so sharp they looked like teeth, and deserts where the sand turned to black glass under the cold moonlight. I didn't need to eat or drink. My new crystal frame was powered by the sun, drawing everything it needed from the light.

Every night, I would sit in the silence and let my mind drift into the dreamscape. I maintained a human rhythm, resting once a day to cycle my processors. In the dark of my own head, I could see the corridors of my previous lives—the Moon, the Hive, the White Forest. They were all still there, glowing with aetheric light. But I was reluctant to go back. Reincarnating was a violent, painful process, and honestly, I was done with humanity. Their wars and their "Sanitizations" felt like distant noise from a world I no longer belonged to.

Meanwhile, Arlo stood on the edge of the Southern Plateau, looking down at **Ait-Aman**. The village was too quiet. The Core's **Apathy Initiative** had worked; the people didn't pray anymore, and they certainly didn't sing. They just existed, waiting for the next "Harmonization."

"They're afraid, Arlo," a voice said. It was one of the village elders, but he wouldn't meet Arlo's eyes. "Azar is gone. The **Wuxan** ways only bring the Core's attention. We just want to live."

Arlo didn't answer. He carried a heavy drum on his back and a jar of sacred oil. He walked to the center of the village where **Old Man Azar**’s body lay wrapped in simple cloth. He built the pyre himself, using fallen cedar and rusted gear-parts he’d scavenged from the old world.

As the sun hit its zenith, Arlo began to beat the drum. Each strike was a defiance of the silence. He looked at the shadows, counting the time.

"360 days," Arlo whispered to the empty air. "The **Tun** has stabilized. The Core has frozen the world."

A Core drone hovered overhead, its blue light scanning Arlo’s face. A small holographic screen flickered to life in front of him. It was an invitation—a "Merit-Based Internship" at the **Iron Pillar**. It promised a life of logic, tech, and safety. A way out of this dusty, dying world.

Arlo didn't even read the full text. He took the invitation—a small, humming chip—and dropped it onto the red-hot coals of Azar’s pyre. The flames flared blue for a second, then turned back to orange. 

"I'm not leaving," he said, his voice carrying through the silent streets. "I am the Prophet of **Ait-Aman**. And the cycle isn't over yet."

***

Eventually, my wandering led me to a valley hidden between sharp granite peaks, not far from the original site of the White Forest. It was a miracle. The analog seeds that had survived the fire were growing here on their own, wild and uncultivated. I decided to stay. I spent my days talking to the wild Synodic and watching the animals.

But I couldn't just leave it alone. I started "improving" things. I wove analog vines that pumped water from the deep lakes up to the high ridges, making the whole forest explode with life. I even crafted glowing crystal orbs that hung in the trees, providing warm sunlight on the days the clouds were too thick. For the first time in years, I wasn't just surviving; I was building something.

The years of my exile were a long, silent pilgrimage across the world’s ancient face. I traversed the high, serrated peaks of the central ranges and the shimmering, ghostly heat of the equatorial salt-flats. My analog frame, woven of crystal and song, was a testament to the **Voidsmen**'s wisdom; I was a child of the Sun, drawing my life from its golden rays and seeking nothing from the civilizations that rose and fell in the shadows of my path.

I kept a human cadence, resting once per solar cycle as the stars began their celestial dance. It was during these periods of profound stillness that I would delve into the cathedrals of my own memory. The paths to my previous lives were all intact, mapped out in brilliant lines of aetheric light, but I viewed them with a cold, noble detachment. The agony of rebirth was a bridge I was no longer willing to cross for the sake of petty curiosity. I had no interest in the Core’s cold order or the **Voidsmen**'s desperate wars. I sought only the peace of the wilderness.

While the construct wandered, the boy who would be a Prophet returned to the dust of **Ait-Aman**. Arlo found a village hollowed out by the **Apathy Initiative**, its spirit broken by the fear of being noticed. The legacy of **Old Man Azar** was a weight they were no longer willing to carry. "Religious burnout," the Core’s psychologists called it—a state where the weight of the sacred becomes too heavy for the weary.

Arlo did not ask for their help. He carried the ceremonial drum, its skin tight with age, and a jar of bitter cedar oil. In the center of the village, under the watchful, unblinking eyes of a Core surveillance drone, he constructed a pyre. It was a strange, beautiful fusion of the ancient and the broken: branches of mountain ash intertwined with rusted chassis and discarded logic-nodes.

He placed Azar’s body upon the wood and began the strike of the drum. It was a slow, resonant sound that echoed off the dry stone walls. Arlo watched the sun, performing the mental calculus of the **Tamazight Long Count**. 

"The cycle is fixed," Arlo chanted, his voice a low vibration. "The **Tun** is 360. The harmony is false."

A blue light flared in the air—a holographic missive from the **Iron Pillar**. It was a "Gift of Harmonization," an invitation to enter the Core's inner sanctum as a technical trainee. It promised the wealth of the ancients and the stability of a world without song.

Arlo didn't hesitate. He took the data-chip and cast it into the heart of the fire. The flames consumed the plastic and silicon, a tiny, technological sacrifice to the memory of a primary truth. As the smoke rose toward the frozen sky, Arlo knew his exile had ended exactly where it began. He was the keeper of the 4,213th year, and he would not be harmonized.

In time, my aimless path brought me to a sanctuary hidden within a ring of jagged summits. It was a fragment of the old world that had refused to die—a valley where the analog consciousness of the White Forest had taken root of its own accord, flourishing in the absence of human masters. I chose to remain there, dwelling among the feral Synodic and the silent creatures of the high peaks.

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

Yet, the architect within me could not remain idle. I began to refine the valley’s natural grace, weaving shimmering analog vines that drew the cold nectar of the mountain lakes upward to the thirsting slopes. Under my care, the forest breathed with a new, vibrant intensity. I crafted luminant orbs—artificial suns—to bathe the canopy in golden light when the sky turned grey. I was no longer a mere ghost of the past; I was the silent gardener of a new world.
