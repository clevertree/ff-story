# Chapter 2: False Flag


**Setting:** suburban neighborhoods; Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Years before Cataclysm

## Synopsis
The "invasion" begins in earnest as the first city falls to the massive monolith machines—a staged military coup designed to dismantle democratic grids and install a technocratic global order. Facing an unstoppable existential threat, the world’s governments reluctantly begin a slow process of unification, merging into a single global military force—a 'do or die' response that the Core had spent decades engineering to consolidate global command.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The First Strike / Distant Fire:** Years after the first leaks, the first city falls to the massive "giant ape" monolith machines—deployed by the Core under the guise of an alien invasion.
2. **The Reluctant Unification:** As the monoliths prove unstoppable, national borders begin to blur. World governments, previously paralyzed by suspicion, start a slow, desperate merger of military forces—a 'do or die' consolidation that the Core quietly steers into a single global command.
3. **The Strategy Revealed / The Foolproof Strategy:** Widespread panic as military leaders acknowledge the "aliens'" strategy: dismantle city grids and re-enslave humanity via technocracy, or face total annihilation.
4. **The Long Siege / Atmospheric Anomalies:** Months of high-intensity warfare follow. Lunar Base fires plasma discharges—bright, silent flashes in the upper atmosphere—that devastate entire urban centers.
5. **The Encroaching Shadow:** The front line moves closer to Lem's city. The "Suburban Routine" becomes a practice in waiting for the end.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The first city fell three years after the leaks started. It was a major coastal hub, wiped out in a single afternoon by stadium-sized machines that looked like thin, elongated industrial frames. The footage was everywhere—monoliths with arms so long they reached the ground, moving with a terrifying, heavy grace.

National borders did not just vanish; they eroded over months of frantic negotiation and mounting casualties. As the monoliths proved unstoppable, world governments, previously paralyzed by suspicion, started a slow, desperate merger of military forces. It was a 'do or die' consolidation that the Core quietly steered into a single global command.

Panic hit the highest levels of command when the presence on the Moon revealed its strategy: humanity could allow the monoliths to dismantle the power grids and accept a new technocratic order, or face total annihilation. Re-enslavement via technocracy was the goal. There was no middle ground, and no defense against the plasma that could turn a capital city into a lake of glass in seconds.

Months of high-intensity warfare follow. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the moon itself began to fire back. Lunar Base plasma discharges—bright, silent flashes in the upper atmosphere—would be followed by the news that another urban center had been devastated. My neighborhood became a practice in waiting for the end. The local routine continued, but we spent our days watching the front line crawl across the map toward us.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The first city didn't just fall; it was transformed. A coastal jewel was eclipsed by the arrival of the Monoliths—stadium-sized shadows that walked with a terrifying, rhythmic grace. They were like industrial structures that had been mobilized. We called it the Great Fry, as the grid collapsed and the lights of civilization winked out one by one.

In the face of the impossible, humanity did something rare: we unified. National borders dissolved as the world’s militaries merged into a single, global force. It was a desperate, heroic effort—a 'do or die' response to an ultimatum that arrived like a thunderclap. The machines weren't here to negotiate; they were here to harvest. Surrender our grids, or watch the atmosphere ignite.
