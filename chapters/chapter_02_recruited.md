## Synopsis
Months after the first monolith attacks, the threat finally reaches Lem's city. As the sky flashes with lunar plasma strikes, a mysterious woman named Lynn arrives with military authority to forcibly recruit Lem. She explains he has been hidden in deep cover for years and that she only recently secured the military clearance to retrieve him. When Lem’s body instinctively rejects the unsettling sensation of her Aether-Drive activation, Lynn is forced to knock him unconscious to meet their extraction deadline, revealing his non-human nature within the digital void of Aether-space.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Months after the first city fell, the invasion finally reached my city. The morning was characterized by the same sequence of ordinary household sounds, but the news bulletins had reached a terminal frequency. The sky was no longer ordinary; the atmosphere hummed with the residual charge of recent plasma strikes.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths on the horizon when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing. I did not move.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position. She approached me with a gait that suggested a high degree of technical authority. Her eyes lacked the shared panic of the neighborhood; her posture was perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds before speaking. "Lem," she said. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn't remember where I'd heard it.

"I've been looking for you for a long time," she said, her voice dropping as the soldiers moved to secure the perimeter. "You were hidden well—deep cover as an ordinary kid in an ordinary town. It took the end of the world for the generals to trust me enough to hand over the location data. We're very late."

She reached out and placed a hand on my shoulder. Suddenly, I felt something cold and heavy pressing against the back of my mind. It felt like a foreign logic trying to install itself into my nervous system. I wanted to help her, but the feeling was too unsettling. It was an invasive, oily sensation of someone else trying to take the controls of my muscles. My body locked up and I pulled away.

Lynn looked at her watch. "I expected this," she said calmly. "The first time is always the hardest, and we don't have twenty minutes for you to adjust."

She struck me once. My world went dark as I passed out.

I was in the Aether-space for the first time. It wasn't a room, and it wasn't a dream. I knew where I was, even if I couldn't name it then. Lynn was there.

She told me I was not human. She explained that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she required my cooperation. I believed her. There was no reason not to.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. I woke up on the floor of my living room. I couldn't move my arms or legs, but I stood up anyway. I walked out the front door, though I wasn't the one making the choice. It felt like something was at the base of my brain, pulling at my muscles like I was a puppet. I was just a passenger in my own body.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

Shortly we arrived at a military base built on the edge of the suburbs stretching into the desert with a series of large hangers. Inside one, a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.

The day the world finally ended didn’t start with a bang. It started with a hum—the electric static of a sky that had forgotten how to be blue. For months, we had watched the flashes in the upper atmosphere, silent and terrifying, but they had always been somewhere else. Until that morning.

I was standing on the curb when I saw them cresting the horizon. The Monoliths. They were stadium-sized titans that walked on all fours, their long, spindly arms reaching the asphalt with a rhythmic, heavy grace. They didn't look like monsters from a movie; they looked like industrial gods that had decided to go for a stroll through our lives. The neighborhood children, who had been playing 'Tripod' for years, stopped dead. The fun had evaporated into the cold morning air.

Then the convoy arrived. Three heavy trucks and a command vehicle tore through the silence of our street, soldiers spilling out with a precision that was both terrifying and comforting. They were the first sign of order in a world falling into chaos.

Lynn stepped out of the lead vehicle. She wasn’t in uniform, yet the sergeant stepped aside like she held the keys to the universe. She looked at me with eyes that seemed to see right through my skin, into the very clockwork of my soul. "Lem," she said, and the name felt like a key turning in a lock I didn't know existed. "The world is changing. You've been hidden for a long time, but the time for hiding is over."

She didn't reach for me with force. Instead, she held out a small, pulsing device that cast a warm, golden glow between us. As I looked into the light, I felt a resonance—a deep, melodic hum in my marrow that answered the device. It wasn't an invasion; it was an invitation. I felt my fear begin to melt, replaced by a strange, ancient purpose.

"The Monoliths are coming, Lem," Lynn said, her voice soft but filled with an undeniable gravity. "If you stay, you'll be part of the silence. If you come with me, you might be the voice that saves us all."

I looked at the horizon, at the titans loping through the suburbs of my childhood, and then back at the woman who seemed to know me better than I knew myself. I didn't wait for her to ask again. I walked toward the transport, my legs moving with a strength I hadn't felt since I was a child. I wasn't being driven. I was choosing to march toward a destiny I was only beginning to understand.

I watched through the rear window as we drove away, watching the Monoliths fade into the dust. I was no longer an orphan in a gray house. I was a passenger on a journey to the end of the sky.
