## Synopsis
Months after the first monolith attacks, the threat finally reaches Lem's city. As the sky flashes with lunar plasma strikes, a mysterious woman named Lynn arrives with military authority to forcibly recruit Lem. She explains he has been hidden in deep cover for years and that she only recently secured the military clearance to retrieve him. When Lem’s body instinctively rejects the unsettling sensation of her Aether-Drive activation, Lynn is forced to knock him unconscious to meet their extraction deadline, revealing his non-human nature within the digital void of Aether-space.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Months after the first city fell, the invasion finally reached my city. The morning was characterized by the same sequence of ordinary household sounds, but the news bulletins had reached a terminal frequency. The sky was no longer ordinary; the atmosphere hummed with the residual charge of recent plasma strikes.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths on the horizon when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing. I did not move.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position. She approached me with a gait that suggested a high degree of technical authority. Her eyes lacked the shared panic of the neighborhood; her posture was perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds before speaking. "Lem," she said. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn't remember where I'd heard it.

"I've been looking for you for a long time," she said, her voice dropping as the soldiers moved to secure the perimeter. "You were hidden well—deep cover as an ordinary kid in an ordinary town. It took the end of the world for the generals to trust me enough to hand over the location data. We're very late."

She reached out and placed a hand on my shoulder. Suddenly, I felt something cold and heavy pressing against the back of my mind. It felt like a foreign logic trying to install itself into my nervous system. I wanted to help her, but the feeling was too unsettling. It was an invasive, oily sensation of someone else trying to take the controls of my muscles. My body locked up and I pulled away.

Lynn looked at her watch. "I expected this," she said calmly. "The first time is always the hardest, and we don't have twenty minutes for you to adjust."

She struck me once. My world went dark as I passed out.

I was in the Aether-space for the first time. It wasn't a room, and it wasn't a dream. I knew where I was, even if I couldn't name it then. Lynn was there.

She told me I was not human. She explained that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she required my cooperation. I believed her. There was no reason not to.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. I woke up on the floor of my living room. I couldn't move my arms or legs, but I stood up anyway. I walked out the front door, though I wasn't the one making the choice. It felt like something was at the base of my brain, pulling at my muscles like I was a puppet. I was just a passenger in my own body.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

Shortly we arrived at a military base built on the edge of the suburbs stretching into the desert with a series of large hangers. Inside one, a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The day the world finally ended for me didn’t start with a bang. It started with a hum—the electric static of a sky that had forgotten how to be blue. For months, we had watched the flashes in the upper atmosphere, silent and terrifying, but they had always been somewhere else. Until that morning.

I was standing on the curb when I saw them. The Monoliths. They crested the horizon like ghouls from a forgotten nightmare, stadium-sized apes that walked on all fours, their long, spindly arms reaching the asphalt with a rhythmic, heavy grace. They didn't look like monsters from a movie; they looked like industrial equipment that had decided to go for a stroll through our lives. The neighborhood children, who had been playing 'Tripod' for years, stopped dead. The game wasn't fun anymore.

Then the convoy arrived. Three heavy trucks and a command vehicle tore through the silence of our street, soldiers spilling out with the clinical efficiency of a surgery. They didn’t ask for permission; they just secured the perimeter.

Lynn stepped out of the lead vehicle. She wasn’t in uniform, yet the sergeant stepped aside like she was a queen. She looked at me with eyes that seemed to see right through my skin, into the very clockwork of my soul. "Lem," she said, and for a second, the name felt like a key turning in a lock I didn't know existed. "You've been hidden in deep cover for a long time. But we're out of time."

She reached for me, and as her hand touched my shoulder, I felt a scream in my marrow. It wasn't pain; it was an invasion. It felt like someone was trying to install a new language directly into my nervous system—a cold, oily sensation of remote-control strings being tied to my brain. My body instinctively fought back, my element reacting to the predator in my head.

"I'm sorry," Lynn whispered, her face a mask of clinical regret. "We don't have twenty minutes for you to adjust."

Everything went white.

I woke up on the floor of my own living room, but I wasn't the one who got up. I felt myself stand, felt my legs move toward the door, yet my mind was just a passenger in the back seat. I watched through my own eyes as I boarded the transport, watching the Monoliths lopping over the rooftops of my childhood. I was no longer a person. I was a vessel being driven to a mission I didn't understand.

## Character Arc
**Lem's Emotional Journey:**
- **From Witness to Asset:** Starts as an observer of the world's end and becomes a tool within it.
- **The Awakening Horror:** The realization that his body is no longer his own.
- **Vessel Intuition:** His body's rejection of Lynn's Aether-Drive hints at his non-human architecture.

**Lynn's Presence:**
- **The Architect of Fate:** She acts with a terrifying level of authority and single-mindedness.
- **Ruthless Compassion:** She is willing to use violence to save what she believes is necessary.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Synodic Mechanics:**
- **Aether-Drive Activation:** The "remote-control" sensation of the first activation.
- **Wood Element Resistance:** Lem's body's failure to immediately sync with the drive.
- **Gorgon/Monolith Design:** The ape-like loping gait of the massive machines.

✅ **Historical Context:**
- **Deep Cover:** Lem being hidden as an ordinary orphan to protect his Wood nature.
- **The Great Fry Foreshadowing:** The news reports of plasma strikes and atmospheric anomalies.
- **False Flag Strategy:** The portrayal of the machines as "alien invaders" to unify world governments.

✅ **Tone:**
- High personal stakes with a sense of encroaching cosmic horror.
- Focus on the physical sensations of loss of agency.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions or internal claims about how a character "felt" or why they did something unless Lem observes the physical evidence. Instead of "She was angry," use "She raised her voice and slammed her hand on the console." No "I didn't like how she said it."
- No clipboards. No throwaway clothing descriptions like "she was wearing a coat" without clinical purpose. All details must be grounded in Lem's clinical observation.
- Balance retrospective and discovery: Lem can provide facts he learned later, but emphasize the moment he discovers them during the events. Use phrasing like "I did not know then that..." followed by the physical description of what he saw.
- Emphasize that Lem remembers an ordinary childhood under institutional care (he was an orphan); avoid cozy family imagery.
- Make the leak about the Lunar Outpost the starting point for the gathering dread; build unease gradually through accumulating anomalies (curtains drawn, radios on, altered schedules) leading up to the military intervention.
- When a convoy arrives, place Lem outside watching the monoliths and specify vehicles and personnel with clinical precision.
