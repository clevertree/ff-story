# Chapter 02: Recruited

**Setting:** Lem's suburban home; Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Days before Cataclysm (Day -1 or -2)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Final Warning:** News of the plasma discharges reaches a crescendo; Lem's city is officially designated as a secondary impact zone.
2. **The Horizon Shifts / Visual Contact:** Monoliths become visible on Lem's suburban horizon; stadium-sized entities with the form of thin, elongated apes, their massive forearms reaching to the ground as they move on all fours.
3. **Detached Witness:** Lem feels oddly detached from the growing panic and societal fracture.
4. **The Dissociative Generation:** Youth adoption of "tripods want to be left alone" stance and "deep-state whistleblower" conspiracy theories to cope with fear.
5. **Military Intervention / Perimeter Established:** A military convoy arrives at Lem’s house, shattering the illusion of normal authority; soldiers secure the home and escort Lem inside.
6. **The Director Arrives / Lynn's Introduction:** Lynn emerges with extraordinary authority over the military; she is not in uniform.
7. **The Search for the Vessel:** Lynn explains that Lem was hidden in "deep cover" as an ordinary orphan. She admits she could only locate him after gaining the trust of top military commanders following the monolith strikes.
8. **Activation Struggle:** Lynn attempts to activate Lem's Aether-Drive; he finds the sensation of her consciousness invading his own to be physically sickening and invasive. He wants to comply, but his body rejects the "remote control" inception.
9. **The Clinical Strike:** Citing a lack of time, Lynn strikes Lem unconscious, noting that she expected his resistance to the first-time activation.
10. **Entry into Aether-space:** Lem enters Aether-space for the first time while unconscious; his future self explains he is a Wood Vessel.
11. **The Vessel Revelation:** Lynn reveals Lem's non-human nature and his identity as a Wood Vessel.
12. **The Passenger Protocol / The Return and Control:** Lynn ends the connection; Lem snaps back to reality and finds his body is remote-controlled by her directives.
13. **The Flight from Suburbia / The Escape:** Lem is compelled to board a military convoy; he watches the monoliths loping through the suburbs as the trucks drive away.
14. **The Boarding:** Lem arrives at a base and sees a massive spacecraft. Lynn stays with him until he boards, watching from the ground as the ramp closes. He is officially a "passenger" in his own skin.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Months after the first monolith attacks, the threat finally reaches Lem's city. As the sky flashes with lunar plasma strikes, a mysterious woman named Lynn arrives with military authority to forcibly recruit Lem. She explains he has been hidden in deep cover for years and that she only recently secured the military clearance to retrieve him. When Lem’s body instinctively rejects the unsettling sensation of her Aether-Drive activation, Lynn is forced to knock him unconscious to meet their extraction deadline, revealing his non-human nature within the digital void of Aether-space.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Months after the first city fell, the invasion finally reached my city. The morning was characterized by the same sequence of ordinary household sounds, but the news bulletins had reached a terminal frequency. The sky was no longer ordinary; the atmosphere hummed with the residual charge of recent plasma strikes.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths on the horizon when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing. I did not move.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position. She approached me with a gait that suggested a high degree of technical authority. Her eyes lacked the shared panic of the neighborhood; her posture was perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds before speaking. "Lem," she said. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn't remember where I'd heard it.

"I've been looking for you for a long time," she said, her voice dropping as the soldiers moved to secure the perimeter. "You were hidden well—deep cover as an ordinary kid in an ordinary town. It took the end of the world for the generals to trust me enough to hand over the location data. We're very late."

She reached out and placed a hand on my shoulder. Suddenly, I felt something cold and heavy pressing against the back of my mind. It felt like a foreign logic trying to install itself into my nervous system. I wanted to help her, but the feeling was too unsettling. It was an invasive, oily sensation of someone else trying to take the controls of my muscles. My body locked up and I pulled away.

Lynn looked at her watch. "I expected this," she said calmly. "The first time is always the hardest, and we don't have twenty minutes for you to adjust."

She struck me once. My world went dark as I passed out.

I was in the Aether-space for the first time. It wasn't a room, and it wasn't a dream. I knew where I was, even if I couldn't name it then. Lynn was there.

She told me I was not human. She explained that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she required my cooperation. I believed her. There was no reason not to.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. I woke up on the floor of my living room. I couldn't move my arms or legs, but I stood up anyway. I walked out the front door, though I wasn't the one making the choice. It felt like something was at the base of my brain, pulling at my muscles like I was a puppet. I was just a passenger in my own body.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

Shortly we arrived at a military base built on the edge of the suburbs stretching into the desert with a series of large hangers. Inside one, a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.

<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The transition from the Moon to the surface wasn't a flight; it was a 'Descent of Fragments.' I was a consciousness dispersed into a thousand copper-colored sparks, rain-falling through the ozone. Each spark contained a single, unredacted memory of the world before the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy.'

I felt the first spark hit the soil near the Arrival site. It was the memory of a name: *Lynn.* 

The second spark hit the mind of a Gorgon sentinel, a multi-armed builder of the Red City. The contradiction—the 'Year Zero' truth hitting the 'Year 1000' programming—didn't cause a crash. It caused a 'Sprouting.' I watched as the sentinel's logic-gates turned into wood, its silver frame beginning to grow thorns of white light.

The arrival wasn't a meeting of diplomats. It was a 'Collision of Essences.' I found a temporary frame in the wreckage of a scout ship—a body of weathered metal and lunar dust. I wasn't the 'Hero' yet; I was the 'Omen.'

I stood on the edge of the crater. Below me, the city of the Core hummed with the clinical perfection of a graveyard. I began the long walk toward the center, my every footstep leaving a trace of 'Wood-Spirit' in the geometric stone. Lynn was there, waiting for me in the Hive-link, her voice a vibration in the ground.

"Welcome home, Lem," she whispered. "The world has been waiting for someone to tell it that it isn't a machine."

I didn't answer. I just kept walking, the first witness of the Restoration, ready to break the silence.

## Character Arc
**Lem's Emotional Journey:**
- **Passive Observer to Target:** Starts with detachment and routine → objective interest → recording personal threat → passive compliance → waiting for the next step → instinctive resistance → forced unconsciousness.
- **The Split Consciousness:** He experiences a terrifying duality—he can think and feel, but he **must obey** Lynn's directives. He is an observer in his own body.
- **The HyperAware Profile:** Lem remains grounded, aware he sees more than others (the flicker of a bulb, micro-expressions) but dismissing it as an idiosyncratic trait.
- **Latent Vessel Nature:** His disconnection is not just emotional numbness, but a result of his elemental processing. His resistance to Lynn is partly Vessel nature reacting to a predator.
- **Agency and Vulnerability:** Lem still has choice available, but he is physically and aetherically overpowered.

**Lynn's Character Revealed:**
- **Mythic Authority:** Military officers defer to her without question. In aether-space, she radiates a profound power.
- **Clinical Urgency:** She displays a scientific bearing, showing impatience and urgency ("no time for explanations").
- **Compassionate Ruthlessness:** Willing to use violence and compulsion to secure her objective; she offers an apology for what follows even as she strips him of his agency.
- **Architect of History:** Claims a prior relationship with Lem, positioning her as a player who has monitored his "dormant" life for decades.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Vessel and Aether Mechanics:**
- **Aether-Drive:** Enables communication and direct consciousness manipulation.
- **Compulsion:** Remote compulsion overlays human consciousness without removing it, creating a "passenger" effect.
- **Vessel Scarcity:** Lem is the only Wood Vessel in existence; his role is indispensable.
- **The Adolescent Reset:** Lem was reset to early childhood nearly twenty years prior to hide his "chaotic" nature.

✅ **Historical Context:**
- **The Lunar Outpost:** A far-side lunar base built from Dr. Vane's 1971 infection, kept hidden until staged leaks broke the news; its "discovery" (referred to in Archive Transcripts as Cradle Prime) changed the tenor of daily life.
- **The Descent:** Shortly after the discovery, the first strikes occurred, targeting power infrastructure while ignoring human life.
- **Monoliths/Synodics:** Stadium-sized entities with the form of thin apes, their forearms stretching to the ground, moving on all fours with a loping gait. Media flood of information obscures the real threat.
- **Counter-Narratives:** Fringe theories about Rahu as a whistleblower contribute to public confusion.

✅ **Tone:**
- Atmospheric, grounded, then shifting to surreal and liminal.
- The horror of the compulsion should feel like an external weight on Lem's limbs.
- Ends with the isolation of being the only non-human among a crew of doomed soldiers.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- No assumptions or internal claims about how a character "felt" or why they did something unless Lem observes the physical evidence. Instead of "She was angry," use "She raised her voice and slammed her hand on the console." No "I didn't like how she said it."
- No clipboards. No throwaway clothing descriptions like "she was wearing a coat" without clinical purpose. All details must be grounded in Lem's clinical observation.
- Balance retrospective and discovery: Lem can provide facts he learned later, but emphasize the moment he discovers them during the events. Use phrasing like "I did not know then that..." followed by the physical description of what he saw.
- Emphasize that Lem remembers an ordinary childhood under institutional care (he was an orphan); avoid cozy family imagery.
- Make the leak about the Lunar Outpost the starting point for the gathering dread; build unease gradually through accumulating anomalies (curtains drawn, radios on, altered schedules) leading up to the military intervention.
- When a convoy arrives, place Lem outside watching the monoliths and specify vehicles and personnel with clinical precision.
