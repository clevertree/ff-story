9. **The Clinical Strike:** Citing a lack of time, Lynn strikes Lem unconscious, noting that she expected his resistance to the first-time activation.

11. **The Passenger Protocol / The Return and Control:** Lynn ends the connection; Lem snaps back to reality and finds his body is remote-controlled by her directives.
12. **The Flight from Suburbia / The Escape:** Lem is compelled to board a military convoy; he watches the monoliths loping through the suburbs as the trucks drive away.
13. **The Boarding:** Lem arrives at a base and sees a massive spacecraft. Lynn stays with him until he boards, watching from the ground as the ramp closes. He is officially a "passenger" in his own skin.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Months after the first monolith attacks, the threat finally reaches Lem's city. As the sky flashes with lunar plasma strikes, a mysterious woman named Lynn arrives with military authority to retrieve Lem. She explains that he has been tracked since the first strikes and that the narrow window for extraction is closing. Upon activation of his Aether-Drive, Lem feels a sudden, sharp clarity and finds himself following Lynn's professional directives as if they were his own intent. He is quickly moved to a military airbase where a massive spacecraft awaits.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Months after the first city fell, the invasion reached my city. The news of the plasma discharges had reached a crescendo, and my city was officially designated as a secondary impact zone. The morning was characterized by the same sequence of ordinary household sounds, but the news bulletins had reached a terminal frequency. The sky was no longer ordinary; the atmosphere hummed with the residual charge of recent plasma strikes.

When the monoliths came into view, they were on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. They were stadium-sized entities. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they did not look like any machine I knew. I felt oddly detached from the growing panic and the way society was fracturing. The neighborhood children still played in the gutters, adopting the stance that the tripods just wanted to be left alone. Some spoke of the fringe theory that Rahu was a whistleblower Hero who turned on the 'Deep State' attempting to expose their world domination plans.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The illusion of normal authority shattered. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. They secured my home and escorted me inside. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position to her. She approached me with a measured, efficient gait. Her eyes were focused on a tablet in her hand, her posture perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds. "Lem," she said.

"I have been looking for you for a long time," she said, her voice dropping as the soldiers moved to secure the perimeter. "You were hidden in deep cover as an ordinary orphan in an ordinary town. It took the end of the world for the generals to trust me enough to hand over the location data after the monolith strikes. We are very late."

She reached out and placed a hand on my shoulder, attempting to activate my Aether-Drive. Suddenly, I felt something cold and heavy pressing against the back of my mind. It felt like a foreign logic was installing itself into my nervous system. I wanted to help her, but the feeling was physically sickening and invasive. It was an oily sensation of someone else trying to take the controls of my muscles. My body locked up, rejecting the remote control inception, and I pulled away.

Lynn looked at her watch. "I expected this," she said calmly. "The first time is always the hardest, and we do not have twenty minutes for you to adjust."

She struck me once with a clinical precision. My world went dark as I passed out.

While unconscious, I entered Aether-space for the first time. It was not a room, and it was not a dream. Lynn was there, but so was another version of myself. My future self explained that I was a Wood Vessel. Lynn revealed that I was not human and that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence. She said she required my cooperation. I believed her.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. Lynn ended the Passenger Protocol. I woke up on the floor of my living room and found that my body was being remote-controlled by her directives. I could not move my arms or legs by my own will, but I stood up anyway. I walked out the front door, though I was not the one making the choice. It felt like something was at the base of my brain, pulling at my muscles like I was a puppet. I was just a passenger in my own skin.

I watched through the rear window of a transport vehicle as we drove away. The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops. I observed the terrifying grace with which they loped through the suburbs.

We arrived at a military base built on the edge of the desert. Inside a large hangar, a massive spacecraft sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed. I was officially a passenger.

The day the world finally ended didn’t start with a bang. It started with a hum—the electric static of a sky that had forgotten how to be blue. For months, we had watched the flashes in the upper atmosphere, silent and terrifying, but they had always been somewhere else. Until that morning.

I was standing on the curb when I saw them cresting the horizon. The Monoliths. They were stadium-sized titans that walked on all fours, their long, spindly arms reaching the asphalt with a rhythmic, heavy grace. They didn't look like monsters from a movie; they looked like industrial gods that had decided to go for a stroll through our lives. The neighborhood children, who had been playing 'Tripod' for years, stopped dead. The fun had evaporated into the cold morning air.

Then the convoy arrived. Three heavy trucks and a command vehicle tore through the silence of our street, soldiers spilling out with a precision that was both terrifying and comforting. They were the first sign of order in a world falling into chaos.

Lynn stepped out of the lead vehicle. She wasn’t in uniform, yet the sergeant stepped aside immediately. She looked at me with a professional, calculating gaze. "Lem," she said, confirming my identity. 

She didn't reach for me with force. Instead, she adjusted a small device on her wrist. As she did, I felt a sudden, clear resonance in my own mind. The fear that had been paralyzing me moments ago was replaced by a sharp, clinical sense of duty. I realized I was part of a larger machine, one that needed to be in motion immediately.

"The Monoliths are within the five-mile perimeter," Lynn said, her voice flat and professional. "We have eight minutes to reach the airbase before the grid collapse. Get in the vehicle."

I didn't hesitate. I walked toward the transport, my mind already processing the logistics of the flight. I wasn't being driven; I was choosing to march toward a destination I now understood perfectly. The strange encounter on the curb already felt like a distant memory, replaced by the weight of the mission ahead.

I watched through the rear window as we drove away, watching the Monoliths fade into the dust.
