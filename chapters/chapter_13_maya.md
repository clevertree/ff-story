# Chapter 13: Maya

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus)
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Following the revelation of Lynn's presence, Lem's consciousness merges with her spirit-persona to form a powerful wood-water hybrid. This dual entity engages Rahu in a supernatural combat, utilizing a swarm offensive to overwhelm the fire vessel and leave him neutralized under a final stasis strike.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Discovery of Lynn:** Rahu deduces she has allied with the Core and demands Iris explain her presence.
2. **The Dreamstate Anchor:** Lem's consciousness slips into a dreamstate. He sees the chamber from multiple perspectives and witnesses Lynn’s spirit-persona speaking to herself, noting that Lem is anchoring her resonance signal to this physical location.
3. **Hybridization Script:** Lynn initiates the "Wood-Water Hybridization" protocol. 
4. **The Merger:** The scattered fragments of her form swarm around Lem, merging with him to create a massive, vine-covered humanoid.
5. **The Cleave:** Rahu attacks the humanoid, slicing it in two. 
6. **Rapid Regrowth:** Lynn triggers "Rapid Regrowth," and the halves reform into two smaller, identical entities.
7. **The Swarm Offensive:** Lynn initiates the "Swarm" attack pattern. The humanoids circle and relentlessly strike Rahu. He slices one down only to see it reform into two smaller humanoids. The 2 smaller humanoids continue to fein attacks distracting Rahu who tries to slice through them but fails. This allows the one larger remaining humanoid to time it's attack during Rahu's distraction.
8. **Neutralization:** The larger humanoid lands a crushing blow, knocking Rahu to the ground. His internal fire and sword are extinguished.
9. **The Final Stasis:** Iris orders a final "Stasis" strike. The soldiers fire their electric weapons, leaving Rahu fully paralyzed and defeated.

He turned to Iris, his voice a scream of rage. "Why is she here? Why is she serving the Core?"

I couldn't hear their voices anymore. The room began to blur, the sounds of the battle receding behind a wall of static. I was falling into the dreamstate again. I could see the nexus from the ceiling, from the floor, from the fragmented pieces of the fallen soldiers. And in the center of it all, I saw Lynn.

She wasn't a girl in the hallway anymore. She was a presence, a spirit-persona drifting through the data-lattice of the room. She was speaking to herself, her voice a series of status updates that echoed in my mind.

"Spirit-Resonance signal is stable," she noted. "Lem's body appears to be anchoring the resonance to this location. Impressive, but expected."

In the physical world, Rahu was threatening Iris, his sword a hand’s-breadth from her throat. He was yelling about truth and the reality of the switch, but I was watching the silver rain on the floor.

"Wood-Water Hybridization script," Lynn announced.

Suddenly, the scattered fragments of her form began to move. They didn't just crawl; they swarmed, drawn toward my own body like iron filings to a magnet. I watched from outside myself as the pieces gathered around my jumpsuit, weaving through the fabric and merging with my skin. I felt a sudden, massive expansion of my spirit. I was growing.

I moved aggressively toward Rahu, no longer a man in a jumpsuit, but a towering humanoid covered in thick, vine-like growth patterns that pulsed with a blue light. Lynn’s voice was calm in the static. "Body remains stable after rapid regrowth. Resonance anchor holding."

Rahu’s fury turned from Iris to me. He Nimble avoided my first strike and lunged, his flaming sword slicing through my torso. I fell to the floor in two large, severed halves.

"Playback of Rapid Regrowth script," Lynn announced.

The two halves didn't die. They pulsed, the vines weaving together in a recursive loop until two smaller, identical versions of the giant stood in the light. We began to circle him. Rahu struck again, his blade carving through one of us, but it simply reformed, the wood absorbing the heat.

"Playback of Swarm attack," Lynn said.

We struck as one. Rahu avoided the first lunge, then the second. He was a master of the blade, slicing through the air with a speed I could barely track, but we were relentless. Every time he cut us down, we regrew. We were the forest, and he was a single flame.

Eventually, one of my forms landed a solid blow, a massive fist of wood and water slamming into Rahu’s chest. The impact threw him to the ground, his inner fire extinguishing as the sword hit the stone and went dark.

"Stasis!" Iris commanded, her voice breaking the soldiers' trance.

They snapped their weapons up and fired once more. This time, there was no counter. Rahu was locked in a cage of arcing plasma and electricity, his body paralyzed, his sword out of reach. We had won, but as I looked down at my wooden hands, I knew the man I had been was gone forever.
