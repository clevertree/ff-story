# Chapter 28: The Village Encounter

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Northern Forest - Large Village

---

## Outline / Summary

Lem and his crew perform a "quick hop" from one village to another. The reception is universally cold; the villagers distrust the Corps and all technology. They have no interest in the "distress signals" that Lem claims to be investigating.

At a larger village, Lem meets **Arlo**, a young boy who is fascinated by technology. While the elders command the villagers to forbid all Core tech, Arlo steps up and provides support for the Corps, helping them reach the villagers. For his support, he is shunned alongside the soldiers, and Lem realizes the boy is an outsider in his own home.

Suddenly, a chilling message crackles over the comms: in a remote northern region managed by **Rahu**, an intense fire has broken out between the defenses and an onslaught of invaders. The soldiers in Lem's village go on high alert, convinced they are next. Lights appear in the distance; the Tripods are approaching.

However, an anomaly occurs. The Tripods in Lem's region refuse to attack the village. They walk around it, clearly focused on a different destination. A soldier under Lem's command, unable to show the same restraint, fires a weapon at one of the passing machines. The retaliation is immediate, but Lem observes a terrifying truth: had they simply left the machines alone, they would have continued on. The "threat" was manufactured by the engagement itself.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Observant and increasingly doubtful of mission parameters. He is forced to manage the "martial law" atmosphere but prefers to defer the "bullying" of villagers to his Metal Vessel soldiers.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Meeting Arlo and recognizing the boy's "enticement" by technology.
    2. Witnessing the Tripods walk *around* the village, contradicting their "aggressive" classification.
    3. Hearing the report of Rahu's violent engagement and comparing it to his own non-event.

### Arlo
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Enamored by technology but torn by his loyalty to his village.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Risking social exile to help Lem communicate with the villagers.
    2. Witnessing the contrast between Core technology and his people's rigidity.
- **Role:** The Village Scout / Outcast.
- **Beat:** Returns with technical details of the Gorgon approach. He catches Lem's eye while Lem is "slaved" to the artillery gun, seeing the boy inside the machine.

### The Villagers
- **Status:** Resentful and dependent. They recognize the Core as a parasitic force that used the "threat" to force their way in. They treat Arlo with open hostility, viewing his "tech-welding" as a curse.

## World-Building Integration
