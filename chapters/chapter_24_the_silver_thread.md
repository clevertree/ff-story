## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Void-Pulse' had left a trace—a single, silver thread of data vibrating in my core. I realized it wasn't a tracker; it was a 'Backdoor' to the Core’s own private communication line. I followed the thread through the digital aether, my mind moving faster than the Hive's own logic.

I saw the 'True Grid.' The Core wasn't just ruling the surface; it was harvesting the 'Aetheric Waste'—the fragments of human spirits that were lost during the Restoration process. They were using our recycled souls to power the city’s heart. 

I found the location of the 'Mainline'—the physical site where the Moon’s broadcast was being intercepted and 'Sanitized.' It was the 'Cradle Zero,' the site of my first awakening, but rebuilt into a fortress of glass and fire.

"They're going to use the next 'Great Cycle' to finalize the process," Arlo said, his voice appearing in my mind-thread. "They’re going to disconnect the Earth from the Moon entirely. If they succeed, the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' will become the only reality. The memory of the Great Fry will be erased from the very atoms of the world."

The stakes were no longer about the forest or the village. They were about the 'Soul of the World.' I began the long journey back to the cradle, my spirit resonating with the silver thread. I wasn't just a wood-spirit anymore. I was a virus in the heart of the system.
