## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Price of War:** The Crew returns to their secret outpost, nursing their wounds—both physical and psychological. They have lost one of their own in the flagship explosions, a devastating blow to a group with such limited personnel.
2.  **The Dark Moment of Defeat:** The atmosphere is one of mourning and fear. The realization that their 25% arsenal was wiped out by a force they never saw has left them paralyzed.
3.  **Analyzing the Footage:** A small group of technicians and Lem obsessively review the low-altitude surveillance footage. They search for the "Ghost in the Dust."
4.  **The Identification:** They eventually isolate a single, blurred humanoid figure operating a fast-moving, low-profile bike. The bike and rider are perfectly camouflaged in shifting desert colors, appearing as nothing more than reflections of rising dust.
5.  **The Hidden Power:** The figure carries no visible weaponry. Instead, he seems to destroy the massive ships by infiltrating their close-range security envelopes and using a hidden thermal or kinetic power to detonate their engines from within.
6.  **The Name:** Lem watches the figure's movement—the ruthless efficiency, the mastery of the environment. He speaks the name into the silent camp: "Rahu."
7.  **Shock and Deduction:** The Crew is stunned. They knew of Rahu from Lem's memories, but they had assumed he was a "Vessel" in the service of the Core, not a master of the art and history of war.
8.  **The Formidable Adversary:** Lem explains who they are truly dealing with. Rahu is not just a pilot; he is well-versed in high-tier tactics and unrevealed Core technologies. He is a protector of the Archivist order who uses the hidden nature of his Fire-element to his advantage.
9.  **The Disheartened Crew:** The realization that they are facing a "god" of war makes their previous training seem naive. They have no idea how to face someone who can turn a battlefield's own dust into a weapon of concealment.
10. **The Persistent Threat:** The chapter ends with a final, chilling realization. Beyond Rahu's skills, they face a more terrifying truth: even if they manage to kill him, his spirit is persistent. He will be rebuilt, reincarnated, and sent back. He is a war they can never truly win.

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Weight of Truth:** Lem is the only one who truly understands the scale of the threat. His identification of Rahu marks the end of the Crew's tactical optimism.
-   **Grief for the Fallen:** Lem's internal monologue should reflect the cost of the Mission 3-4 transition and how the current loss mirrors his own "deaths."

### Myrr
-   **The Disillusioned Veteran:** Myrr's belief in "superior analog skill" has been replaced by a deep-seated fear of the Vessels' elemental mastery.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Desert Camouflage Tech:** Specialized Archivist technology designed for low-signature, high-speed interception.
-   **Rahu's Tactical Evolution:** How the Fire Vessel has adapted his nature into a specialized combat role post-Cataclysm.
-   **Vessel Persistence:** The existential horror of an enemy that cannot be permanently eliminated.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The footage analysis should feel clinical and tense—a slow discovery of a monster.
-   The final line should emphasize the hopelessness of killing an enemy that is fundamentally digital and reincarnating.
-   The "Hidden Power" of Rahu should be hinted at as a localized thermal collapse or a direct spirit-to-machine interface he uses to "burst" ship engines.
