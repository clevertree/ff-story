# Chapter 21: The Mission 2 Briefing

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** Cradle Zero - Strategic Briefing Theater

---

## Outline / Summary

Lem, now fully recovered and "manifested" in a new Wood Vessel form, is brought before the Core leadership for his first official briefing. He stands in a high-tech theater, surrounded by Metal Vessels who stand in perfect, identical rows. The briefing is led by **Lia Vane**, who uses a large holographic mapping system to show the northern human settlements.

Lia explains the premise of **Mission 2**: the expansion of the Archivist influence into the northern forests. She informs the force that several "tech beacons"—advanced monitoring devices—have been installed near non-tech villages to ensure their safety. She reports that "Distress Calls" have been detected from these regions, indicating "Wild" Gorgon activity.

During the briefing, Lia reveals a critical piece of information to the Vessels: they are now functionally immortal. She explains the **Re-creation Protocol**, informing them that their Aetheric signatures are continuously backed up at the base. If they fall in battle, they will be manifested anew, free from the "fear of death." Lem finds the clinical nature of this revelation unsettling, especially when a distress call alert interrupts the briefing almost immediately after its conclusion—a timing that feels too convenient to be coincidental.

Lem also notes the conspicuous absence of Rahu. No one mentions his "explosion" in Chapter 18, and his name is omitted from the roster, as if he never existed or is being prepped for something else entirely.

## Character Arc

### Lem
- **Emotional/Psychological State:** Cautious and observant. He is playing the part of the "wiped" Vessel, but his spiritual memory is recording everything.
- **Key Beats:**
    1. Observing the disturbing conformity of the Metal Vessels.
    2. Processing the "immortality" revelation and its implications for his autonomy.
    3. Noting the suspicious timing of the distress call.
    4. Noticing the erasure of Rahu from the mission records.

### Lia Vane
- **Status:** Idealistic. She genuinely believes the "Re-creation" and "Rescue" missions are the pinnacle of human-machine cooperation. She is the public face of the Core's benevolent facade.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Re-creation Protocol:** The technology that allows Vessels to be physically reconstituted after death.
✅ **Tech Beacons:** Their official purpose (safety) vs. their hidden purpose (manufacturing distress).
✅ **Northern Geography:** The contrast between the equatorial deserts and the northern forests.
✅ **Mission Interface:** Mention of the HUD markers and remote control protocols.
✅ **The Failed Wipe:** Lem's internal awareness despite the Core's belief that he is reformatted.

## Notes & Spoilers

- **Internal Spoiler:** The distress call was triggered by the Core's own beacons to justify the deployment.
- **Question:** Is Lia aware that the distress calls are manufactured, or is she being used as a naive mouthpiece?
