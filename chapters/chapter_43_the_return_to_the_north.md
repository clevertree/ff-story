## Chapter Outline

1.  **Launch from the Ash:** Lem boards the newly manifested hovercraft. The vehicle is silent and efficient, a perfect marriage of Analog sub-structure and Core-level blueprinting. He leaves the ruins of the White Forest behind, heading due North.
2.  **The Flight of Reconnaissance:** As he travels, Lem uses the high altitude to survey the changes in the world. He is shocked by the progress of the **Aggressive Expansion** project.
3.  **The Erasure of the Wilds:** He passes over formerly independent northern territories. Vast swathes of forest have been clear-cut. In their place, the Archivists have constructed gleaming, sterile "Hive Cities"—geometric monoliths of glass and sync-metal that look like invaders on the landscape.
4.  **The Fate of the Villages:** Most of the independent northern villages he remembered have been absorbed or replaced by these Hive clusters. The cultural erasure he feared in Year 15 AT appears nearly complete in these sectors.
5.  **The Untouched Anomaly:** Finally, Lem reaches the cluster of five villages where Arlo lived—the site of **Mission 3**. To his surprise, the area is an island of preservation.
6.  **No Cities in Sight:** There are no Hive Cities here. No cleared forests. The villages appear exactly as they did a decade ago—stubborn, analog, and seemingly forgotten by the Archivist expansion.
7.  **The Mystery of the Exemption:** Lem wonders why this specific cluster was spared. Was it a technical failure of the Core, or is something else protecting them?
8.  **The Final Approach:** Lem slows the hovercraft, keeping it low to avoid detection by any stray Core beacons. He finds a secluded landing spot miles away from the primary village.
9.  **The Sacrifice of the Craft:** He powers down the vehicle. Instead of merely hiding it, the aetheric-drive triggers a "Blooming" sequence. The hovercraft disintegrates into its constituent particles, rapidly growing into a cluster of small, vibrant trees that blend perfectly into the local flora. 
10. **Walking into the Past:** Lem enters the forest on foot. The trees he just created serve as a beacon for any "Analog" inhabitants—a signal of his return. He carries only his internal knowledge and the "Key."

## Character Arc

-   **Grief for the World:** Seeing the Hive Cities confirms his worst fears about the Archivist "Utopia."
-   **Protective Instinct:** His focus shifts from global observation to the specific protection of the Mission 3 cluster.
-   **The Traveler:** He returns to the status of a wanderer, but one with the power of the "Key" hidden within him.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Hive Cities:** The finalized form of the "Utopian Cities" from Mission 2.
-   **Archivist Cartography:** How the Core manages global expansion and the potential "blind spots" in their map.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   Contrast the vibrant, messy green of the untouched villages with the cold, sterile cyan and white of the new Hive Cities.
-   Lem's internal monologue should reflect the five years of isolation—he is more patient, more observant, and less prone to the "Mission HUD" distractions of his youth.
-   The ending should build a sense of tension: is the village truly "safe," or is it a trap?
