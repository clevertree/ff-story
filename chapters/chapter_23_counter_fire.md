# Chapter 23: Counter Fire

**Setting:** The Dead Zone / Equatorial Frontier
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Lem, now known as Ashwood, joins Rahu and a Metal Vessel squad for the reclamation of the Dead Zone known as Mission Counter Fire. Utilizing high-speed hovercrafts, they deploy Aetheric Buoys that use "Repeating commands" and electroshock deterrents to drive away the wild psionic wildlife. During this time, Lem discovers the hive-mind nature of the Metal Vessels and Vector’s ability to control them as a collective. The mission takes a violent turn when their buoys awaken a dormant Monolith at the desert's edge. A massive Core gunship, the *Obsidian Sledge*, arrives to suppress the threat. In the ensuing battle, the Monolith is brought down by plasma fire, but its shattered fragments rain down on the crew, knocking Lem unconscious once again.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Dead Zone Mission:** Lem joins Rahu and a team of Metal Vessels to reclaim the territory surrounding the fallen Fire City - a mission code named Counter Fire.
2. **The Hovercraft Pursuit:** The team operates high-speed hovercrafts to outpace the psionic monoliths and other wild technologies that attempt to reclaim the zone.
3. **The Aetheric Buoys:** To deter the psionic wildlife, Lem and the team deploy buoys that emit "Repeating commands" to leave, along with digital interference and electroshock deterrents.
4. **The Metal Secret:** During the mission, Lem learns that the Metal Vessels are a hive mind; Vector can simultaneously see through and operate multiple bodies or detach a primary node for tactical independence.
5. **The Forest Sleeper:** While the mission proceeds smoothly, a Monolith suddenly appears at the desert's edge near a large forest, ripping trees from the ground as it rises from its resting place.
6. **The Obsidian Sledge:** Vector identifies that the buoys must have disturbed the entity. As the Monolith marches toward the beacons, the massive Core gunship *Obsidian Sledge* arrives to provide heavy fire support.
7. **The Rage of the Machine:** Vector orders an attack; the gunship strikes the Monolith with plasma cannons. Though staggered, the entity enters a rage and charges the *Obsidian Sledge*, heading directly toward Lem’s position.
8. **The Shattering Fall:** The gunship fires a second volley, taking out the Monolith’s legs. The massive machine topples and shatters upon impact, sending sharp fragments flying into the crew like shrapnel.
9. **Darkness Returns:** Struck by the debris, Lem’s body is destroyed and his vision goes dark once again, ending the mission in chaos.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The hovercraft's engine was a high-pitched scream against the oppressive silence of the Dead Zone. I gripped the railing of the *Counter Fire* transport, watching the purple dunes blur past. Beside me, Rahu stood like a statue, his eyes fixed on the horizon where the ruins of the Fire City I had helped build lay in cooling cinders.

"Buoy deployed," a Metal Vessel called out. Its voice was flat, devoid of the metallic rattling of the Gorgons I had grown used to. I watched as the small, silver sphere hit the sand and immediately began emitting its "Repeating commands." 

*LEAVE. THIS AREA IS SECURED. LEAVE.*

It was a psychic shove, a digital hammer intended to drive away the psionic wildlife that had claimed this territory. I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the wind. To the world, I was Ashwood—a loyal soldier of the Core. But inside, I was still the Architect, watching my life's work being sanitized by the very people who had destroyed it.

Suddenly, the ground shook. A mile away, at the edge of a fossilized forest, the sand erupted. A Monolith, ancient and terrifying, rose from its slumber. It didn't look like a machine; it looked like a mountain that had decided to walk.

"Vector, we have an awakening," Rahu said, his hand already on the hilt of his blade.

"Confirmed," Vector's voice came through the comms, sounding strangely layered, as if a dozen voices were speaking at once. "The *Obsidian Sledge* is in position."

A shadow blotted out the sun. The massive gunship descended, its plasma cannons glowing with a sickly blue light. The first volley hit the Monolith with the force of a falling star. The machine roared—a sound that shattered the glass of our sensors—and charged. 

It was a collision of two eras. The ancient psionic titan against the Core's surgical precision. The *Obsidian Sledge* fired again, catching the Monolith in the joints. The titan buckled, its massive frame tilting toward our transport. 

"Brace!" Rahu shouted.

The world exploded into a cloud of jagged metal and white light. A fragment of the Monolith, the size of a housing module, slammed into our deck. The last thing I saw was Rahu reaching for me before the darkness reclaimed everything.
