## Synopsis
The combined Lem-Lynn form successfully extinguishes Rahu’s fire using superior elemental mass. With Rahu neutralized, Novak orders her team to secure him using a containment pulse. Lynn then separates from Lem and enters the central energy column to trigger the global reset, leaving the survivors within the safety of the pyramid as the Great Fry begins.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Rahu struck with a fire-blade, cutting the combined Lem-Lynn form into two pieces. We did not cease to function. The separate parts flowed back together and struck Rahu during his recovery. Our combined mass extinguished the fire in Rahu's frame.

Rahu fell to the stone floor, a scorched metal frame. Iris Novak ordered her weapons team to deploy the containment pulse. They fired a heavy handheld device, delivering an electrical jolt to Rahu's core. He became immobile.

Lynn then separated from me and walked toward the energy column at the center of the pyramid. She entered the light, and her form disintegrated into a swirling vortex. The pyramid began to vibrate, and the light became too intense for my sensors. Novak looked at her display and stated that the pyramid was currently the safest location on the Moon or the Earth. The light expanded until it covered the entire viewport. The reset had begun.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
Rahu struck, his fire-blade carving through us, but we were a living tide. We closed around him like reinforced conduits, smothering his heat with the weight of our shared life. The combination of my Wood frame and her Water essence was an irresistible force, a flood that the fire could not consume.

Rahu collapsed, his fire extinguished, his frame a blackened monument to his struggle. Novak didn't hesitate. "Secure him! The corridor must hold!" she cried to her team. The weapons squad stepped forward, their pulse-cannon singing as it delivered the final lock to Rahu's core.

Lynn separated from me, her eyes filled with a quiet pride. She walked toward the center of the pyramid, her silhouette dissolving into the vortex of the reset, a hero entering the light. Novak watched her tablet with a scientist's focus as the world began to tremble beneath us. The pyramid surged with a power that defied measurement, creating a sanctuary as the atmosphere itself began to glow with the friction of the coming change.
