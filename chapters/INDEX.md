## Section Overview

**Primary POV:** Lem (Chapters 1-12+); expanding to observe Tor, Iris, and Rahu's presence
**Setting:** Earth → Spacecraft → Lunar approach → Catastrophe → Lunar Surface → Combat Engagement → Pyramid Interior
**Narrative Arc:** 
- Lem's isolation from ordinary life
- Involuntary activation and discovery of his nature
- Embedding within human military structure
- Gradual realization that institutional knowledge cannot be trusted
- Cataclysm initiates; Moon fragments; ship destroyed; Lem survives
- Aether-Drive activation confirmed; mission interface engaged
- Isolation and mission-focused survival begin
- Lem joins combat operation and encounters another Vessel (Rahu)
- Tor sacrifices flagship to suppress Rahu; Novak assumes command
- Lem realizes the profound cost of survival
- Strike force reaches pyramid sanctuary; outer base collapses
- Tor returns alive; mission recalibrates from victory to confrontation
- Lem's understanding of complicity deepens as true mission unfolds

**Key Themes:**
- The cost of systematic deception
- Information warfare as psychological warfare
- The gap between public knowledge and hidden truth
- The loneliness of being apart from humanity
- Institutional authority collapsing under impossible circumstances
- Individuals as casualties of larger forces

**Critical Unresolved Questions Addressed:**
- How is Lem activated? (Ch. 2-3: Linn triggers him via Aether-Drive contact and remote compulsion)
- What is Linn's authority? (Ch. 2, 4, 7: She operates outside military hierarchy; makes life-death decisions)
- How much does Lem know about his nature? (Ch. 3-8: He is learning as he goes, compelled to obey)
- How much does Tor know about the Cataclysm? (Ch. 8: Is his speech prepared? Does he know it's coming?)
