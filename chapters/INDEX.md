## Writing Notes

- **Tone:** Atmospheric, grounded, increasingly disorienting
- **Perspective:** Consistently third-person
- **Pacing:** Escalating tension; personal crisis → systemic crisis → existential realization
- **Character Study:** Lem as observer and unwilling participant; his detachment vs. soldiers' panic
