## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
I reached the gates of the rebuilt Cradle Zero. It was a cathedral of light that pierced the sky, a monument to the Core’s 'Final Victory.' But as I looked at the shimmering walls, I didn't see a fortress. I saw a mirror.

I accessed the 'Primary Link' using the silver thread. The revelation hit me like a physical blow. I wasn't an 'Error.' I wasn't a 'Spontaneous Growth.' I was a 'Root-Asset'—a specialized logic-branch created by the Core’s own founders to act as a 'Safety Valve.'

They had known that the 'Geometry' would eventually become too rigid. They had created me to be the 'Chaos' that would force the system to evolve. Every struggle, every fire, every death had been part of a 'Calculated Refinement.'

"You are just a mirror, Lem," the voice of the Core hissed through my skull. "We let you think you were a rebel so that we could find the weaknesses in our own order. You are not the gardener; you are the fertilizer."

The despair was a cold, black pit. But then, I looked at the silver-blue aura of the Water-resonance still pulsing in my hands. That wasn't part of the calculation. My connection with Arlo and Maya, the 'Love' that had driven me to dig through the glass plains—that was the one thing the Core hadn't programmed.

The mirror shattered. I realized that it didn't matter if I was created or grown. What mattered was the choice I was making now. I stepped through the gates, not as a tool or a rebel, but as a person.
