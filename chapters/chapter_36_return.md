^: Return

**Setting:** The Northern Forest and high ridge overlooking the valley
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)

## Synopsis
Following their physical reunion at the mission site, Myrr explains the dire situation in the North. He reveals that his band of **Voidsmen** has been exiled from their own people to pursue a mission of revenge, while the rest of the **Voidsmen** have fled to a secret sanctuary—a location Myrr's team cannot know for security reasons. Myrr catches Lem up on the fate of the North, revealing that all other villages have been converted into Core megacities through a dual propaganda strategy of "voluntary" conversion (Strategy A) or "Gorgon-prompted" rescue (Strategy B). He notes the suspicious absence of destruction footage and the unreported presence of **Archipelago** floating islands during these attacks.

From a high ridge, Lem observes the five villages of the **Wuxan Pentad** currently encircled by Core monitoring pillars. Myrr catches Lem up on the fate of the North, revealing that all other villages have been converted into Core megacities through a propaganda strategy of "voluntary" conversion (Strategy A) or "Gorgon-prompted" rescue (Strategy B). Myrr further explains the ideological deadlock: Arlo has become a Prophet, uniting the villages under a strict rejection of all technology. This conflict is exemplified by the Voidsmen's use of the **Analog Mind Link**—a process of total neural synchronization that villagers fear as a manipulative "industrial witchcraft." Myrr also details their insistence on **Tribal Currency** as a defense against the Core's centralized **Allocation** system, which he warns can be revoked at the "flip of a switch." Lem, being minimalist and unarmed, resolves to enter the valley alone to investigate the connection between Arlo and the spirit of Maya.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
2. **The Reunion:** Myrr reveals that his team have been exiled from their own people—the **Voidsmen**—in order to engage in a mission of revenge to take down the Core while the rest of the **Voidsmen** have fled to a secret sanctuary.
3. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
4. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
5. The reason for the exile is that they can never know where the secret sanctuary is located, in case they ever get captured.
6. **The Northern Capitulation:** Myrr catches Lem up on the fate of the surrounding region. He reveals that all other northern villages have been converted into Core megacities, leaving only the five villages of the **Wuxan Pentad** as holdouts. He explains the Core's dual propaganda strategy: either villages "embrace" the Core's vision after being protected by buoys (Strategy A), or they resist, are devastated by Gorgon incursions, and are "rescued" by the Core to be rebuilt as megacities anyway (Strategy B). Myrr notes that while Gorgon Striders are seen on footage, the actual moment of destruction is always hidden, and the **Voidsmen** detected unreported **Archipelago** floating islands during the attacks.
7. **The Truth of the Link:** Myrr explains the **Analog Mind Link**, the Voidsmen's method of absolute truth verification. He warns Lem of its addictive nature and its tendency to cause "Reality Drift." He laments that the non-forest villagers reject the link as a device of mistruth, deepening the schism.
8. **Economic Sovereignty:** Myrr describes the Voidsmen's trade ethics—knowledge over technology, rare resources over credits. He highlights their rejection of the Core's **Allocation** system, preferring physical tribal currency to the "flip of a switch" dependency of the megacities.
9. **The Wuxan Schism:** Myrr explains the ideological deadlock between the **Voidsmen** and the villagers of the **Wuxan Pentad** regarding the total rejection of external technology.
10. **The Shadow of the Buoys:** From a scouting ridge, Lem observes the monitoring pillars trapping the villages in a deceptive cage of protection.
11. **The Voice of the Prophet:** Lem and Myrr listen to Arlo's sermons, discovering he has united the villages through the **Wuxan** oral traditions and ancestral protocols.
12. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
13. **The Spiritual Deadlock:** Myrr laments that the villagers view the **Voidsmen**'s analog tools as a spiritual corruption, preventing any form of cooperation.
14. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
15. **The Tactical Stymie:** Myrr's warriors cannot approach the village perimeter without triggering a violent response from the villagers who now reject outside interference.
16. **The Wuxan Investigation:** Lem, possessing no visible weapons or technology, resolves to enter the valley alone to investigate the suspected link between Arlo and the spirit of Maya.
17. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
18. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Myrr’s team emerged from the brush—**Voidsmen** who had traded everything for a chance at revenge. He told me the rest of their people had moved to a secret sanctuary far away, but they had stayed behind. They were bound by a vow of silence to protect their new home, and they were obsessed with a single mystery: the girl from my Moon memories and the boy from **Ait-Aman**.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

"We can't know where they went," Myrr explained, his voice hollow. "If the Core catches us, we can't betray a secret we don't have. We're the ghosts left behind to haunt the ones who burned us."

He caught me up on everything I’d missed while I was a fragment in the aether. The North I remembered was gone. Every village for a hundred miles had been swallowed up by the Core and turned into a megacity—all except the five villages of the **Wuxan Pentad** where Arlo lived.

"The news from Cradle Zero makes it sound so clean," Myrr said, gesturing to a flickering portable display. "They show us two stories. In the first, they put up their buoys and the villagers 'realize' their old ways are backwards and ask for the megacity. In the second, the village resists the buoys, and suddenly Gorgon Striders show up and tear everything down. Then the Core 'rescues' the survivors and builds the city anyway."

I watched the footage on the screen. It showed Striders looming over burning huts. "But the actual destruction... it's never on camera," I noted.

"Exactly," Myrr whispered. "The news says once the Gorgons move in, the signal dies. But our sensors detected something else. **Archipelago** floating islands were in the area every single time a village fell. The Core never mentions them, but the Voidsmen know. They aren't rescuing anyone; they're clearing the land."

Myrr pulled a small, wooden-framed device from his belt. It looked like a heavy compass, but it hummed with a soft, pulsing light. "This is how we stay sane, Lem. The **Analog Mind Link**. If I connect with someone, I see everything they see. Every corner, every secret. No one can lie to you when your minds are the same." He looked at the device with a mix of reverence and fear. "But it's dangerous. You start to prefer the thoughts to the ground under your feet. Some of us drift away and never really come back to reality."

"Do the villagers use it?" I asked.

Myrr shook his head. "They hate it. To them, it's just more industrial witchcraft—a device that can plant lies instead of truth. It's one of the reasons they won't even look at us. They think we've traded our privacy for a high-tech dream."

He looked out at the valley. "They'd rather trade physical things. Rare minerals, seeds, clean water. We trade knowledge, mostly. But we never take their credits. The Core's **Allocation** system is a gilded cage. You get everything for free, sure, but the Core holds the switch. Imagine having every luxury in the world and then losing it all in one heartbeat because some technician at Cradle Zero didn't like your tone. The villagers tell their kids that a physical coin in your pocket is worth more than a thousand invisible promises."

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

We climbed to a high ridge, looking down at the valley through Myrr’s long-range optics. The five villages of the **Wuxan Pentad** were encircled by Core monitoring pillars—monolithic pillars of black glass that pulsed with a low, vibrating menace. They looked like giant needles stuck in the earth, watching for any sign of advanced technology. Myrr told me the Core justified them as protection against the Gorgons, but it was clear they were a cage.

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

But the villages weren't giving up. Myrr played me intercepted audio of Arlo’s sermons. I couldn't believe it was the same kid. His voice was deep and steady, carrying the weight of a man who had lived several lifetimes. He wasn't talking about gadgets or power; he was preaching about the **Wuxan** ancestral protocols. He taught his people that their oral traditions were more authentic than any digital archive because they couldn't be hacked or erased. 

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

"He's using the same elemental faith we once knew," Myrr whispered, his voice tight. "The same calendar, the same prayers. But he says our **Voidsmen** tech is just a different color of the corruption. He thinks we've traded our souls for wooden armor."

<!-- TODO: Reflect on the historical or religious significance of this specific location/event. -->

I looked at Myrr’s heavy, living-wood armor and his glowing pulse-rifle. "They won't let you in, will they?"

<!-- TODO: Explicitly state how much time is passing during this description. -->

"To them, we're worse than the Core," Myrr admitted. "We're the cousins who betrayed the Earth. We can't even get past the perimeter without triggering a fight because they think our presence poisons the soil."

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

I looked at my own hands. I was minimalist, made of crystal and fiber-optics, but I didn't carry a weapon. "I might be seen as clean," I said.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

Myrr nodded. "You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see the man instead of the machine."

## Draft (13_PLUS)

Myrr’s warriors emerged from the brush—**Voidsmen** who had traded their lives for a chance at vengeance. He told me of the Great Migration, how the rest of their kind had fled to a secret sanctuary behind the veil of the world. But they had stayed. They were the sentinels of the North, bound by a vow to find the truth of the girl in my memories and the boy who walked the paths of **Ait-Aman**.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

"We are the forgotten ones," Myrr said, gesturing to his scarred team. "The sanctuary remains hidden from us, a city of silence we can never visit. We chose this exile so that no torture could ever wring its location from our lips. We are the sword that protects the peace we can never share."

Myrr spoke of the years I had missed, a dark history of northern capitulation. He revealed that the patchwork of independent villages I once knew had been systematically erased, replaced by the sterile geometries of Core megacities. Only the five villages of the **Wuxan Pentad** remained as a final, stubborn holdout in the frost.

"The broadcasts from Cradle Zero present a binary destiny," Myrr explained, his eyes fixed on the frozen valley. "Strategy A: the Core deploys its buoys, and the villagers supposedly reject their 'primitive' traditions to embrace the vision of the new world. Strategy B: the village resists, only to be decimated by a Gorgon incursion. The Core then arrives as a savior, providing humanitarian aid that just happens to include the foundation of a megacity."

He adjusted a sensor array, showing me a grain map of a fallen settlement. "They show the Striders attacking, but the actual moment of devastation is a media blackout. They claim the Gorgon signals jam all transmissions. But we know better. Our analysts tracked **Archipelago** floating islands hovering in the shadow of the clouds during every single 'rescue' operation. The public never hears about the islands, but the Voidsmen see the patterns. It's not a rescue; it's a redaction."

Myrr gestured to the specialized helmets his warriors wore. "We maintain the **Analog Mind Link** to ensure operational transparency. It is the ultimate check against the Core's misinformation. When we link, we explore the thought-landscape of our peers, leaving no corner unchecked. It is a state of absolute honesty." He paused, his gaze drifting. "The risk is addiction. The union is so pure that the physical world begins to feel like a coarse, unnecessary distraction. It is a slow descent into Reality Drift."

"The villages in the valley... they don't accept this link?" I inquired.

"They view it as a technical assault," Myrr replied grimly. "They consider it an interface capable of manufacturing mistruths rather than revealing them. To Arlo’s people, it is just another digital ghost in a wooden shell. They place their trust in physical trade—cold-forged iron, raw materials, and verified knowledge. They refuse the Core's **Allocation** system, regarding it as a weapon of total dependency."

Myrr looked at me, his eyes hard. "The villagers tell their children to imagine a life of total luxury, every resource provided by the Hive. Then they tell them to imagine the Core flipping a switch and taking it all back. They prefer the rugged sovereignty of their tribal currency because a remote command at Cradle Zero cannot erase the value of a physical trade. They live in reality, Lem. And in reality, unprovable claims are a death sentence."

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

From the high ridge, the valley below looked like a garden strangled by thorns. The Core had planted their monitoring pillars—monolithic pillars of black glass—around the perimeter of the **Wuxan Pentad**. They hummed with a low, vibrating menace, a net of shadows that watched every movement. Myrr told me the Core called them shields against the Gorgons, but it was the same old tactic: create the threat, then sell the cage.

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

Yet, inside that cage, a new song was rising. We crouched in the brush and listened to the echoes of Arlo’s voice, carried upward by the wind and the rhythmic chanting of the villagers. The boy was gone. In his place was a man who spoke with the weight of mountains. He sang of the **Wuxan** ancestral protocols, a path of living that existed before the first word was ever carved into stone or etched into a circuit. 

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

“He is speaking our own prayers,” Myrr whispered, his eyes fixed on the distant fires. “He follows the same sacred calendar, the same protocols that we carry in the forest. But he calls our **Voidsmen** tools a betrayal. He tells his people that our analog waves are just another flavor of the corruption that killed the old world. He is proving that to him, we are no longer kin.”

<!-- TODO: Reflect on the historical or religious significance of this specific location/event. -->

The truth was a bitter pill for Myrr. He and his **Voidsmen** were as welcome in that valley as the Core itself. To the villagers, their living wood armor and pulse-rifles were just a different color of systemic corruption—a failure that had traded purity for protection.

<!-- TODO: Explicitly state how much time is passing during this description. -->

“You are the only one who can walk through the gate,” Myrr said, laying a hand on my wooden shoulder. “You have no metal in you, Lem. No hum of the Hive, no steel in your soul. If you go in with open hands, they might see you as a brother of the earth who still remembers the **Wuxan** path. They might see the man instead of the machine.”

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

I looked at the valley below, knowing that my next step would be the most dangerous of all. I had to know if the connection to Maya was real, or if Arlo was simply a man lost in his own myth. I prepared to enter the valley alone. Myrr and his team remained on the ridge to maintain their silent vigil over the perimeter.
