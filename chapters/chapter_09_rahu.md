# Chapter 9: Rahu

**Setting:** Lunar surface; advance toward the moon base; debris field; strike team formation
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Lem boards his hovercraft and joins the forward strike team. With the ground forces, he advances across the lunar surface toward the moon base. He activates the cockpit controls; the adrenaline surge is absolute as he observes the fleet and the approach through the cockpit monitors. As the formation reaches the ridge overlooking the plain leading to the moon base, Rahu appears on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operates a massive plasma array that fires an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dares enter the plain leading to the moon base. The ground forces are completely exposed—no cover. The situation becomes a kill zone. A pilot in the lead unit confirms Rahu's signature and intentionally turns his comm off before his vehicle is destroyed; The chapter ends with the human fleet pinned and the desperate tactical necessity for what follows (Next Chapter: Sacrifice).

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Activation:** Lem activates the hovercraft's systems. The cockpit monitors provide a crisp, if overwhelming, sensory feed of the surroundings.
2. **Joining the Unit:** Lem moves out from the wreckage and rendezvouses with other pilots—military hovercraft in formation. He operates within mission protocol; they treat him as part of the line.
3. **Logistics:** Lem observes the movements of the human fleet, their coordination precise and cold. The strike team advances as a coordinated unit.
4. **The Advance:** The ground forces move across the lunar dust toward the objective. Waypoints on the cockpit displays guide the formation; communication is sparse, professional.
5. **The Base Revealed:** On the horizon, the moon base becomes visible—artificial geometry, power signatures. The scale of the objective is incomprehensible. No enemy response yet.
6. **Approach to the Ridge:** The formation reaches the ridge that overlooks the plain leading to the moon base. The terrain funnels them; the open ground ahead offers no cover.
9. **Rahu Identified:** A pilot in the lead unit reports a signature match on his radar: "Confirmed: Rahu." He turns his communication switch off as his vehicle disappears in a flash of light. Rahu appears on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operates a massive plasma array that fires an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that moves onto the plain leading to the moon base.
8. **The Kill Zone:** The ground forces are completely exposed on the open plain with no cover against the mysterious plasma arcing down from above. This desperate situation creates a tactical kill zone. The human fleet is pinned behind the ridge; comms fill with overlapping reports.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

I climbed into the hovercraft and the cockpit powered up. My adrenaline spiked as the monitors flooded with data—waypoints, formation markers, the status of every unit in the strike line. For a moment I couldn't tell where to look first as the displays flickered to life. Then it sharpened. Novak had said move. I moved.

Other craft were already rolling out from the wreckage. I fell in with them. No one spoke to me; they didn't have to. The automated mission data on my screen put me in the right slot. We were the ground forces now—what was left of us—and we were heading toward the moon base.

The fleet above was a scatter of lights and shadows, cut off by the debris field. I could still read their positions on the navigation monitor: holding, adjusting, waiting. Our advance was the only thing moving. The dust under the hovercraft was fine and cold. The horizon stayed black until something else appeared—angles and lines that weren't rock. The base. It grew slowly. No fire yet. No contact.

We reached the ridge. The plain on the other side was empty and wide—the plain leading to the moon base. There was no cover.

Then Rahu appeared. He stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, sending an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. On the radio, pilots gave disorganized orders. We were completely exposed. The ground forces had no cover against the mysterious spheres arcing down from the mountain peak. The situation became a kill zone. It was a moment of absolute desperation.

A pilot in the lead unit came over the comm. "Confirmed: Rahu." He turned his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappeared in a flash of light. No final sound. I watched the marker on my screen vanish.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The hovercraft accepted my weight and the cockpit monitors flared into life. My pulse raced as the screens activated with a clarity that was almost violent—every channel open, every feed live on the console. Formation markers, fleet positions, navigational waypoints. I was no longer a passenger. I was part of the line.

I joined the strike team without ceremony. Other pilots in similar craft were already moving out from the wreckage. We did not speak. The mission protocol did not require it. I took my position in the formation and the advance began.

Above us, the human fleet hung in the black—fragmented by the debris field, their movements precise and cold on the tactical display. They could not reach us. We could not wait for them. The ground forces were the only asset in motion. I observed the logistics of it: the automated spacing, the shared waypoints on my monitors, the silence that passed for discipline.

We crossed the lunar dust for a long time. The base appeared on the horizon as a problem in geometry—unnatural, vast. The navigation screen tagged it as the objective. No weapons fire. No contact. Only the approach.

Then the ridge. The formation slowed. Beyond it, the plain opened—the plain leading to the moon base. No cover. No alternative route.

Rahu stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. The ground forces were completely exposed on the open plain with no cover against the mysterious plasma arcing down from above. The situation became a tactical kill zone. The comms filled with overlapping reports. We were pinned.

A pilot in the lead unit reported a signature match on his radar: "Confirmed: Rahu." He turned his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappeared in a flash of light. No final sound was heard. I watched the signal on my console flicker and die. The next move would require sacrifice.

## Character Arc (13_PLUS)
**Lem's Record (13_PLUS):**
- **The Witness of the Strike:** Lem transitions from survivor to participant; his actions and his will align with the strike unit.
- **Integration:** He operates as part of the unit without standing out—the pilot in the line.
- **Witness to the Kill Zone:** He records Rahu’s tactical advantage and the total exposure of the ground forces; the lack of cover creates the desperate tactical necessity for what follows (Chapter 10).
- **The Discovery:** He records the lead pilot's sacrifice—confirming Rahu's signature, silencing his comm, then destruction without a final cry.

## World-Building Integration
- **Strike Protocol:** Ground forces advance under mission telemetry; fleet support is limited by debris.
- **Moon Base:** Terrain/target is the **plain leading to the moon base** (not “lunar base” or “central pyramid” in this chapter).
- **Rahu’s Weapon:** A **massive plasma array** firing an **unlimited barrage of plasma balls**; Rahu is **wreathed in a large fire** on **the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain**; **advantageous position**; ground forces **completely exposed**, **no cover**, **kill zone**. (Original wording; no CheckMate in this chapter.)
- **The Discovery:** A pilot in the lead unit confirms Rahu's signature and intentionally turns his comm off before his vehicle is destroyed; (From b91f39c: chapter_06_alone_on_the_moon beat 13.)

## Revision Notes (13_PLUS)
- **Traditional Heroic Narrative:** High-speed action and epic scale; approach then Rahu’s appearance and the kill zone.
- **Agency:** Lem is a participant in the strike, fulfilling his role as a monitor/vessel.
- **Original Wording:** Emphasize Rahu’s tactical advantage from the mountain peak, highlighting the **relentless nature of the plasma array**. Highlight the **total exposure** of the ground forces; the lack of cover creates the desperate tactical necessity for the sacrifice in Chapter 10.
- **No CheckMate:** The original draft did not use “CheckMate”; that label belongs in Chapter 10 if used at all.
