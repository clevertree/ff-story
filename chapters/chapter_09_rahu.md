# Chapter 9: Rahu

**Setting:** Lunar surface; advance toward the moon base; debris field; strike team formation
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Lem boards his hovercraft and joins the forward strike team. With the ground forces, he advances across the lunar surface toward the moon base. His internal systems activate fully; he observes the fleet and the approach. As the formation reaches the ridge overlooking the plain leading to the moon base, Rahu appears on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operates a massive plasma array that fires an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dares enter the plain leading to the moon base. The ground forces are completely exposed—no cover. The situation becomes a kill zone. A pilot in the lead unit confirms Rahu's signature and intentionally turns his comm off before his vehicle is destroyed; Lem notes the lack of a final cry. The chapter ends with the human fleet pinned and the desperate tactical necessity for what follows (Chapter 10: the flagship’s sacrifice).

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Activation:** Lem's internal systems activate fully as he boards the hovercraft. The sensory feed is overwhelming but crisp.
2. **Joining the Unit:** Lem moves out from the wreckage and rendezvouses with other pilots—military hovercraft in formation. He operates within mission protocol; they treat him as part of the line.
3. **Internal Logistics:** Lem observes the automated systems of the human fleet, their movements precise and cold. The strike team advances as a coordinated unit.
4. **The Advance:** The ground forces move across the lunar dust toward the objective. Waypoints and tactical overlays guide the formation; communication is sparse, professional.
5. **The Base Revealed:** On the horizon, the moon base becomes visible—artificial geometry, power signatures. The scale of the objective is incomprehensible. No enemy response yet.
6. **Approach to the Ridge:** The formation reaches the ridge that overlooks the plain leading to the moon base. The terrain funnels them; the open ground ahead offers no cover.
9. **Rahu Identified:** A pilot in the lead unit reports a signature match: "Confirmed: Rahu." He turns his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappears in a flash of light. No final sound is recorded. Rahu appears on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operates a massive plasma array that fires an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that moves onto the plain leading to the moon base.
8. **The Kill Zone:** The ground forces are completely exposed on the open plain with no cover against the mysterious plasma arcing down from above. This desperate situation creates a tactical kill zone. The human fleet is pinned behind the ridge; comms fill with overlapping reports.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

I climbed into the hovercraft and the link went live. My systems flooded with data—waypoints, formation markers, the pulse of every unit in the strike line. For a moment I couldn't tell where my eyes ended and the display began. Then it sharpened. Novak had said move. I moved.

Other craft were already rolling out from the wreckage. I fell in with them. No one spoke to me; they didn't have to. The telemetry put me in the right slot. We were the ground forces now—what was left of us—and we were heading toward the moon base.

The fleet above was a scatter of lights and shadows, cut off by the debris field. I could still read their positions on my interface: holding, adjusting, waiting. Our advance was the only thing moving. The dust under the hovercraft was fine and cold. The horizon stayed black until something else appeared—angles and lines that weren't rock. The base. It grew slowly. No fire yet. No contact.

We reached the ridge. The plain on the other side was empty and wide—the plain leading to the moon base. There was no cover.

Then Rahu appeared. He stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, sending an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. On the radio, pilots gave disorganized orders. We were completely exposed. The ground forces had no cover against the mysterious spheres arcing down from the mountain peak. The situation became a kill zone. It was a moment of absolute desperation.

A pilot in the lead unit came over the comm. "Confirmed: Rahu." He turned his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappeared in a flash of light. No final sound. I recorded the absence of it.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The hovercraft accepted my weight and the interface locked in. My internal systems activated with a clarity that was almost violent—every channel open, every feed live. Formation markers, fleet positions, navigational waypoints. I was no longer a passenger. I was part of the line.

I joined the strike team without ceremony. Other pilots in similar craft were already moving out from the wreckage. We did not speak. The mission protocol did not require it. I took my position in the formation and the advance began.

Above us, the human fleet hung in the black—fragmented by the debris field, their movements precise and cold on my display. They could not reach us. We could not wait for them. The ground forces were the only asset in motion. I observed the logistics of it: the automated spacing, the shared waypoints, the silence that passed for discipline.

We crossed the lunar dust for a long time. The base appeared on the horizon as a problem in geometry—unnatural, vast. My interface tagged it as the objective. No weapons fire. No contact. Only the approach.

Then the ridge. The formation slowed. Beyond it, the plain opened—the plain leading to the moon base. No cover. No alternative route.

Rahu stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. The ground forces were completely exposed on the open plain with no cover against the mysterious plasma arcing down from above. The situation became a tactical kill zone. The comms filled with overlapping reports. We were pinned.

A pilot in the lead unit reported a signature match: "Confirmed: Rahu." He turned his communication switch to the off position. His machine disappeared in a flash of light. No final sound was recorded. I noted the lack of a final cry. The next move would require sacrifice.

## Character Arc (13_PLUS)
**Lem's Record (13_PLUS):**
- **The Activated Observer:** Lem transitions from survivor to participant; his systems and his will align with the strike.
- **Integration:** He operates as part of the unit without standing out—the vessel in the line.
- **Witness to the Kill Zone:** He records Rahu’s tactical advantage and the total exposure of the ground forces; the lack of cover creates the desperate tactical necessity for what follows (Chapter 10).
- **The Discovery:** He records the lead pilot's sacrifice—confirming Rahu's signature, silencing his comm, then destruction without a final cry.

## World-Building Integration
- **Strike Protocol:** Ground forces advance under mission telemetry; fleet support is limited by debris.
- **Moon Base:** Terrain/target is the **plain leading to the moon base** (not “lunar base” or “central pyramid” in this chapter).
- **Rahu’s Weapon:** A **massive plasma array** firing an **unlimited barrage of plasma balls**; Rahu is **wreathed in a large fire** on **the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain**; **advantageous position**; ground forces **completely exposed**, **no cover**, **kill zone**. (Original wording; no CheckMate in this chapter.)
- **The Discovery:** A pilot in the lead unit confirms Rahu's signature and intentionally turns his comm off before his vehicle is destroyed; Lem notes the lack of a final cry. (From b91f39c: chapter_06_alone_on_the_moon beat 13.)

## Revision Notes (13_PLUS)
- **Traditional Heroic Narrative:** High-speed action and epic scale; approach then Rahu’s appearance and the kill zone.
- **Agency:** Lem is a participant in the strike, fulfilling his role as a monitor/vessel.
- **Original Wording:** Emphasize Rahu’s tactical advantage from the mountain peak, highlighting the **relentless nature of the plasma array**. Highlight the **total exposure** of the ground forces; the lack of cover creates the desperate tactical necessity for the sacrifice in Chapter 10.
- **No CheckMate:** The original draft did not use “CheckMate”; that label belongs in Chapter 10 if used at all.
