# Chapter 35: Parley

**Setting:** Arlo's Village / The outskirts of the five Northern Villages
**Timeline:** Year 1022 (Year 22 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Tactical Relocation:** Following their conviction to protect the North, Myrr’s crew relocates specialized modular mechanical trees from the White Forest to the outskirts of the five northern villages. These trees are moved and replanted to form a massive defensive perimeter around the valley.
2. **Defensive Germination:** Under the northern sun and supplemented by analog energy pulses from the resistance, the mechanical flora undergoes rapid growth, creating a dense "Wooden Shield" of bio-mechanical structures.
3. **The Ground and Air Phalanx:** Within days, the White Forest villagers use their mind-link technology to refashion the groves into ground-based defensive walkers and anti-air bio-mechanical turrets, preparing for a full ground and air defense of the villages.
4. **The Interrupted Sermon:** Arlo is delivering a sermon on the village platform when the sleek, white Core diplomatic craft descends, an intrusion of white metal in the mud.
5. **The Diplomatic Break:** Arlo pauses his speech. He descends from the platform and walks toward the landing zone as Cassia Vane and a group of "First Citizens" emerge.
6. **The Plea for Surrender:** Outside the ship, Cassia meets Arlo and has a desperate conversation about surrender. She warns him of a staged attack from remote-controlled Gorgon striders, while Arlo explains why he cannot trade his independent life for regulated safety.
7. **The False Flag Revelation:** Cassia admits she only just discovered that the Core isn't just ordering the striders—they are remotely controlling them directly. The realization of this total remote hijacking ends her lingering faith in Core ethics.
8. **The Return to the Word:** With nothing left to say, Arlo leaves her and returns to the platform. Disillusioned with the Core's logic and moved by Arlo's presence, Cassia and several Core citizens follow him into the village to listen.
9. **The Philosophy of Responsibility:** Arlo resumes his sermon, addressing the village and the visitors alike. He explains that humans are defined by their duties, not by their survival.
10. **The Stoic Refusal:** Arlo formally rejects the offer of core integration, choosing the right to a physical death over an artificial, data-driven life.
11. **The Departure:** The ship leaves, carrying the ambassadors back, but leaving the village under the threat of the upcoming "insurrection."

## Synopsis
While Myrr’s crew rapidly constructs a massive ground and air defense system by relocating and respawning White Forest tree assets around the five northern villages, Arlo’s sermon is interrupted by the arrival of a Core diplomatic craft. Pausing his address, Arlo meets Cassia Vane at the ramp of her ship for a final, private conversation about surrender. Cassia warns of an impending "Plan B"—a staged assault by remote-controlled Gorgon striders designed to look like a rogue insurrection. She is visibly shaken, having just realized that the Core possesses the ability to remotely hijack and "drive" these frames directly, a level of control she hadn't thought possible. Arlo refuses to exchange the village's sovereignty for the artificial safety of the Meridian Hive. When Arlo returns to his platform to finish his sermon, a group of disillusioned Core citizens and a weary Cassia follow him, choosing to hear his message even as the threat of a staged massacre looms. Arlo delivers a final, stoic refusal, asserting the value of human responsibility over mere biological preservation.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The valley didn't look the same as it had a week ago. On the outskirts of the five villages, the horizon was now jagged with the silver-green leaves of the mechanical trees. Myrr’s team had moved them here in pieces, replanting them in a massive circle that hummed with analog energy. Under the pale northern sun, they had grown into a wall of wood and wire in just a few days. The villagers were already linked to them, twisting the branches into anti-air turrets and heavy walkers. We were ready for a fight, even if Arlo was still talking about peace.

Arlo was standing on the cedar platform in the village square, his voice steady as he spoke about the change of the seasons. Then the sound came—a low, clinical hum that vibrated in the soles of my boots. A white ship, sleek and polished, descended through the mist and landed right in the middle of our village, sending a spray of mud over the wooden walkways.

Arlo didn't look angry. He just stopped talking, mid-sentence, and waited. As the ramp lowered, he stepped down from the platform and walked toward the ship. I followed him as far as I dared. Out stepped Cassia Vane, looking like she hadn't slept in a thousand years, followed by a handful of "First Citizens" in their pristine gray tunics.

"I need to speak with you," Cassia whispered. She led him to the shadow of the ship's hull, away from the ambassadors.

Arlo stood in silence as Cassia spoke, his face a mask of calm that I’d seen a thousand times before. He didn't need to ask why she was there; we all knew. She was there to offer us a way out that felt more like a cage.

"I'm here to save your life," Cassia replied, her voice shaking. "The Core isn't negotiating anymore, Arlo. They've already authorized a 'rogue' Gorgon strike. A hundred striders, descending on this valley to make it look like an internal uprising. And Arlo... they aren't just sending orders to them. I saw the telemetry on the ship. They're 'driving' them. Remote hijacking. They can take over a brain-core from ten thousand miles away."

The landscape of the North had been transformed by the urgent necessity of defense. In the span of a few days, the outskirts of the five villages had been fortified by the arrival of the White Forest’s modular trees. These mechanical sentinels, transported in dormant fragments and brought to life by the resistance’s analog pulses, had taken root with a terrifying speed. Through the mind-link, the villagers had refashioned the growing grove into a phalanx of ground-based walkers and towering anti-air batteries, weaving a "Wooden Shield" that bristled against the gray sky.

Beneath this canopy of living steel, the sky cracked with the arrival of the Core. A white ship, polished to a mirror sheen, descended like a cold star into the heart of the village. Arlo did not flinch. He stopped his sermon, the silence falling over the crowd like a heavy cloak, and walked toward the white metal. At the foot of the ramp, he met Cassia Vane, a woman who looked as though she carried the weight of the entire iron world on her shoulders.

"I have come to speak of the end," Cassia said, her voice barely audible over the hum of the ship's engines. She drew him into the shadow of the craft, away from the eyes of the ambassadors.

Arlo listened with the patience of a mountain. He knew the terms before they were spoken. The Core had exhausted its patience; the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" was cracking, and they needed a final, bloody demonstration to seal the narrative.

"They have authorized the 'rogue' protocols," Cassia whispered, her hands trembling as she smoothed her pristine gray tunic. "A legion of Gorgon striders is already en route. But Arlo... they are not merely autonomous. I have seen the command nodes. The Core has hijacked their consciousness. They are driving them like puppets, intending to manufacture a massacre that the world will blame on 'machine instability.' It is a total remote possession."

Arlo nodded, his gaze shifting to the group of village elders standing nearby. "The Core thinks they can reshape time," he said, loud enough for Cassia to hear. "They call this Year 1022, a thousand years of their making. But the people of this valley never lost count. The Elders know it has only been twenty-two years since the fire. They haven't been living in a fallacy; they've been living in the truth. Your machines can take our lives, Cassia, but they can't take our history."

### Lem
- **The Witness of Preparation:** Lem notes the efficiency of the White Forest's bio-mechanical logistics, comparing it to the slow, heavy industrialism of the Core.
- **The Bridge:** He observes the interaction between Arlo and Cassia, noting the visible decay of Cassia's loyalty to the system she serves.

### Myrr (Off-screen / Context)
- **The Architect of the Shield:** Myrr's influence is seen in the rapid deployment of the defensive grove.
