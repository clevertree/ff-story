## Synopsis
Following Rahu’s failure, the Core initiates "Plan B"—the total redaction of the Northern Problem via the Iron Pillar. This orbital plasma weapon, a masterpiece of Core engineering, operates on a precise seven-minute recharge cycle. As the satellite erases neighboring villages in a calculated sequence, Arlo leads a final, defiant vigil in the central square. Cassia Vane definitively rejects her Hive origins, choosing the visceral reality of the village over the sterile data of her past. Lem records the event not as a tragedy, but as a testament to human character. The chapter concludes as the third and final strike incinerates the village in an instantaneous white erasure.

## Chapter Beats

1. **The Whitewashing Maneuver:**
   Realizing their champion Rahu is defeated and the terrestrial purge has failed, the Core authorizes Plan B. They transition to the Orbital Strike—the Iron Pillar—to vaporize the survivors while preparing to attribute the destruction of the five northern villages to rogue Gorgon striders. The sky above the five villages glows as the massive satelite charges it's capacitors. 

2. **The Final Defection:**
   As the first village is incinerated by the orbital strike, Lem urges Cassia to leave, but she refuses. She realizes the Core were giving her time to escape while targeting Arlo's home, and she chooses to stay on the mud-stained ground, breaking her final ties to the Hive.

3. **The Second Strike:**
   A high-intensity thermal column descends from the sky. The secondary village is vaporized instantly.

4. **The Recharge Window:**
   Ku, a resistance technician, provides the critical telemetry from the safety of her remote outpost outside the village: the Orbital Strike is a lunar-synchronized satellite with a 7-minute recharge cycle. 

5. **Refusal to evacuate:**
   Arlo rejects the idea of a desperate defense of the buildings. He refuses to initiate a mass evacuation of the witness group and instead continues a vigilant sermon to keep the focus of his people on their internal strength rather than the looming threat.

6. **The Stoic Trinity:**
   As the targeting laser for the third strike—the Iron Pillar—locks onto the central square, Lem, Cassia, and Arlo maintain their positions. Arlo continues his final sermon on the tribe's Reincarnation religion, highlighting the need to maintain one's character and always keep searching for new knowledge even in the face of inevitable destruction.

7. **The Descent of the Iron:**
   The Iron Pillar discharges a massive pillar of invisible scalar energy. There is no travel time, only an instantaneous atmospheric ignition as the plasma weapon incinerates everything within the village perimeter. The world turns into a blinding white void.

## Character Development
### Lem
- **The Witness-Recorder:** Lem takes on the role of the ultimate archive, preparing to carry the memory of the village and it's ending into whatever existence follows the fire. He observes the fragile state of humanity, noting that while the Great Fry took many, it is the scarcity of the "After Time" that truly tests the 25-35% who remain.

### Arlo
- **The Unwavering Voice:** Arlo remains the emotional and spiritual anchor, using the recharge intervals to cement the identity of his people before they are erased.

### Cassia Vane
- **The Definitive Choice:** Cassia's final act is a literal commitment to the truth of her observations over the Core's narratives. She chooses to die with the villagers rather than live in the mud.

## World-Building Integration
- **Orbital Plasma Strike (Iron Pillar):** A massive orbital weapon system that discharges invisible scalar energy. It is designed to incinerate entire urban centers instantaneously. The Core omits the weapon's existence from all records.
- **The Seven-Minute Constant:** The recharging requirement for the Orbital Strike’s focusing lenses. This technical limitation dictates the rhythm of the attack.
- **Narrative Whitewashing:** The strategy of hiding orbital intervention behind the cover of terrestrial machine failures.
- **Seven-Minute Rhythm:** The mathematical constant that governs the pacing of the purge. 
- **Scalar Interference:** High-frequency energy that causes well water to boil without heat and metal to resonate with high-pitched "singing."

## Draft: YOUNG_ADULT

My sensors detected the shift before the villagers looked up. The sky turned a hard, artificial violet as the capacitors in the upper atmosphere began to cycle. The Core had authorized Plan B. They would vaporize the northern settlements and blame it on a rogue Gorgon strider—a simple narrative whitewash to cover a masterpiece of engineering.

The first strike hit the neighboring village. It wasn't an explosion; it was an erasure. A pillar of white light connected the sky to the earth and the village simply ceased to exist in a cloud of ionized dust.

I looked at Cassia. I reminded her that she could still make the perimeter. But she looked at the mud on her boots and shook her head. She spoke about how the Hive’s utopia plans were a false promise, while the struggle here, in the cold and the dirt, was the first real thing she had ever felt. She made it clear that she was done with the Hive and would stay here, on the ground, with Arlo.

The second strike took the next village seven minutes later. The thermal column was perfect.

Ku’s voice came through my radio link, heavy with static from her remote outpost miles away. She told me the telemetry was clear: the Iron Pillar was a lunar-synchronized weapon. It had a seven-minute recharge window. It was enough time to pray, but not enough to run.

Arlo didn't call for an evacuation. He knew there was nowhere to go. Instead, he stood in the central square and kept talking. He spoke to his people about internal strength, telling them that their character wasn't something the Core could kill, even if it could kill their bodies.

Then the targeting laser touched our square. I felt the scalar frequencies begin to resonate in my own frame. Arlo, Cassia, and I stood together as the sky ignited. The Iron Pillar discharged, and the world became a blinding, absolute white.

## Draft: 13_PLUS

The sky above the Northern Dead Zone transformed into a bioluminescent bruise. High above, the Iron Pillar shifted its focusing lenses, a masterpiece of Core engineering preparing to redact the northern villages from history. The plan was classic whitewashing: vaporize the resistance and attribute the carnage to rogue Gorgon striders.

The first strike was a silent, vertical incision of plasma that turned the western horizon into a wall of white fire. I urged Cassia to use her clearance and head for the perimeter, but she refused. She spoke of the hollow data of the Hive and how the visceral, mud-stained reality of the village was worth more than a thousand years of sterile existence. She explained that she were choosing the truth of her observations over the Core's narratives, and that her place was here in the mud.

The second strike descended exactly seven minutes later. Another village was vaporized, replaced by a column of high-intensity thermal energy that left nothing but glass in its wake.

Ku’s voice crackled through my comms, a frantic whisper from her hidden telemetry station miles outside the village perimeter. She reported that the satellite was locked into its seven-minute recharge rhythm, a mathematical constant dictating the pace of our destruction.

Arlo stood firm in the square, rejecting any notion of a desperate flight. He used the recharge windows for one final sermon, his voice steady as he spoke of the tribe’s belief in reincarnation. He told them that even in the face of inevitable erasure, the search for knowledge and the maintenance of one’s identity were the only things that mattered.

As the third targeting laser locked into the center of the village, the scalar interference intensified. Metal groaned with a high-pitched singing, and the well water began to boil without heat. I stood with Arlo and Cassia, recording the testament of their stoicism.

Then the Pillar discharged. It wasn't a hit; it was an instantaneous atmospheric ignition. The scalar energy turned the world into a void of pure light, erasing us all in a heartbeat of white fire.
