# Chapter 18: The Long Exile

**Timeline:**
1. Rahu's presence in the forest; observation from the shadows.
2. Departure into the deep wilderness; abandoning the machine network.
3. Evolution of Lem's aetheric body without external "updates."
4. Sudden resonance of "Maya Match" – a clue from his original existence.

**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Solitude and observing Rahu's influence from the shadow of the forest.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, assertive, and grounded voice.
- Use a Welsian, clinical observational tone—brief declarative sentences, precise details, no domestic sentimentalism.
- Avoid scientific or robotic language; describe in everyday terms
