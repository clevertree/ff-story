**Setting:** Main Chamber of the Lunar Pyramid
**Timeline:** Year 26 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Estimated Length:** 4,500-5,500 words

---

## Chapter Outline

1. **The Engagement:** Battle between Lem and Rahu. Lem uses wood-water assets but Rahu is more advanced and faster than before.
2. **The Reinforcement:** General Tor enters the chamber, having been ordered by Elowen Vane to assist.
3. **The Counter-Argument:** Rahu claims Lem is initiating the reset. Tor rejects the claim, citing his trust in Lem and Vane. 
4. **The Alliance:** Lem and Tor combine forces. Lem merges into Tor's iron body to hit Rahu with a wood-earth-water combined attack, quenching his fire and knocking him down.
5. **The Trap:** The Core leadership activates massive cathodes in the ceiling, striking all three androids with electricity.
6. **The Grounding:** Lem spills himself and the paralyzed Tor into a globular pool and forces a "root" into the lunar rock.
7. **The Anode:** This combined node redirects the Core's electricity back against Rahu, paralyzing him. Core realizes the trap and jettisons the cathode machinery.
8. **The Separation:** Lem and Tor separate. Tor’s body features have changed, showing wood-metal integrations.
9. **The Enragement:** Rahu, feeling betrayed by the Core’s failed trick, becomes enraged. He knocks Lem away and assaults Tor.
10. **The Final Sacrifice:** Tor is overwhelmed by the speed and heat of Rahu's blows. He flares up and is struck so hard he disintegrates into dust. 

## Character Arc

**Lem's Emotional Journey:**
- Combat-focus → Shared bond with Tor → Grief and absolute resolve.
- **The Grounded Node:** Lem demonstrates his peak technical mastery by turning the enemy's energy into a defensive tool.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Facts Applied:**
- Vessels can merge to combine elemental properties (Wood+Earth results in a grounded node).
- The Lunar Pyramid has built-in electrical defensive cathodes controlled by the Core.
- Disintegration is the final consequence for a Vessel whose energy is fully consumed in a thermal event.
