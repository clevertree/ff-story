# Chapter 15: Abortion

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
As the Reset intensifies, the Sun begins to fail and Earth suffers catastrophic tectonic shifts. On the Moon, the changing magnetic charge causes the soldiers' plasma weapons to malfunction, allowing Rahu’s stasis field to evaporate. Rahu awakens and lurches into the central vortex, catching fire and disintegrating. Following his disappearance, the Reset is aborted and the celestial bodies calm. Rahu begins to restore in the center of the pyramid, but Novak immediately orders both him and Lem paralyzed with stasis weapons, plunging Lem into darkness.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The reset intensifies.** Novak notes the Sun appears to be going out. It's losing strength rapidly.
2. **The Earth experiences major cataclysm** on the side nearest the moon.
3. As the pyramid's vibration intensifies, the remaining soldiers panic and attempt to dismantel the sealed door to the chamber but Iris orders them to halt. She looks at her display and states that the pyramid is currently the safest location on the Moon or the Earth.
4. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
5. **Weapon Failure:** Soldiers suddenly report the status field on Rahu is going out. Novak looks at her sensors and reports that the charge of the moon's surface has changed, and the guns must be recalibrated. They ignore her and fire on the stasis field but their guns are no longer firing plasma straight. The beams arcs towards the ground and back at them, and they abandon their weapons.
6. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
7. **Rahu's stasis field evaporates and he wakes up.**
9. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
10. **Disintegration:** Everyone watches as he lurches towards the vortex with great trouble, eventually catching on fire and disintegrating just like Lynn did.
11. **Abortion:** Shortly after Rahu disintegrates, the reset is aborted and rapidly shuts down.
12. **The moon and earth calm**, and Rahu is seen restoring in the center of the pyramid.
13. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
14. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
15. **As he falls to the floor in a weakened state**, Iris once again orders the soldiers to fire and they paralyze him in a stasis field.
16. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
17. **Iris then orders the soldiers to paralyze Lem**, and he is struck by the same weapons.
18. **Darkness:** Lem's vision goes dark.
19. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
20. TODO: Clarify the passage of time and situational shifts in the setting.
21. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
22. **The Dark Return:** Lem awakens in the dreamstate following his paralysis, but the environment is pitch black. He hears Lynn’s voice announcing mission failure.
23. **The Whiteout:** In the darkness of his mind, Lem hears Lynn's voice one last time—an apology whispered before a blinding flare of white light consumes his awareness.
24. **The Shattering:** Lem’s vision whiteouts as an internal failure triggers. His perception shatters alongside his senses. He finds himself viewing the pyramid chamber through thousands of glass-like fragments simultaneously, as if his very eyes have been splintered.
25. **Global Perspective:** (TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions as the "Great Fry" is reported across the remains of the grid).

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Reset intensity peaked, resulting in luminescence that overwhelmed external visual sensors. Iris Novak monitored localized data streams. Sensor readouts indicated a significant drop in solar output. The energy transfer was siphoning power from the solar-grid into the lunar-pyramid infrastructure.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

Tectonic seismic activity on the Earth’s near-side exceeded recorded norms. The pyramid structure recorded mechanical stress from global plate destabilization. Atmospheric ionization increased due to lunar resonance. Novak confirmed a reversal in the moon's localized magnetic polarity.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

The Wood Vessel (Rahu) remained immobilized in the primary hall. The soldiers' containment hardware suffered critical failures. Technical reports indicated field instability due to magnetic interference. Calibration errors in the experimental launchers caused plasma discharges to arc unpredictably. The personnel abandoned the heavy ordnance.

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

The stasis field collapsed following total power loss. The Wood Vessel resumed motor functions. He initiated an uncoordinated movement towards the central aetheric vortex. His thermal signature increased rapidly as he approached the energy-column. Upon contact with the vortex, his molecular structure destabilized. He suffered a total physical disintegration, mimicking the transition of AI Lynn.

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

The Reset protocol was aborted immediately following the Wood Vessel’s disintegration. The aetheric column destabilized and dissipated. Acoustic and seismic readings returned to baseline levels. Localized gravitational and magnetic fluctuations stabilized.

<!-- TODO: Reflect on the historical or religious significance of this specific location/event. -->

A Restoration sequence initiated within the central chamber. Aetheric shards consolidated into a new humanoid frame. The Wood Vessel was reconstructed. Upon completion of the sequence, the subject became inert on the floor. His exterior plating displayed significant thermal damage.

<!-- TODO: Explicitly state how much time is passing during this description. -->

Iris Novak authorized an immediate re-containment strike. The secondary stasis launchers, now calibrated to the new magnetic environment, successfully immobilized the Wood Vessel. Novak then authorized a stasis-strike against my unit. The launchers discharged and the field locked my skeletal-motor system. My visual feed transitioned to total darkness as my consciousness was forced into a reset-cycle.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The light of the Restoration was a physical weight, a blinding whiteness that bleached the world of detail. Novak’s presence was a lone shadow against the brilliance, her sensors singing a warning—the Sun itself was fading, its ancient fire being siphoned into the foundations of the Moon like a candle in a gale. Through the cathedral-like ceiling of the pyramid, I saw the Earth shudder. The side facing us glowed with the friction of shifting continents, a slow-motion transformation on a planetary scale. It was the birth of a new world, paid for in the currency of the old.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

Rahu lay broken in the center of the hall, held by the dying embers of Novak’s stasis field. The soldiers’ weapons began to fail, their plasma bolts arcing wildly toward the ground as the very magnetic poles of the Moon inverted. The field evaporated with a sound like tearing silk, the energy dissipating into the stone floor.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

Rahu rose. He didn't attack us; he didn't even see us. He was a smoking monument to a fallen god, lurching toward the vortex where Lynn had vanished. He fought for every step, his physical form catching fire from the sheer intensity of the light—not the fire of his own power, but the flame of a world rewriting itself. Then, like a hero entering the sun, he disintegrated into the brilliance.

<!-- TODO: Detail what background characters are doing or saying during this moment. -->

But the reset was not yet complete. The screaming column of energy suddenly choked, collapsing with a violent shudder that shook the very stars. The world fell into a silence so profound it felt like the first day of creation. In the center of the hall, fragments of light began to knit together, weaving a new, charred body from the Restoration. Rahu was back, his physical form reborn but broken, falling to the stone in a heap of blackened silver. He was restored—a living echo of the man he had been.

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

Novak didn't hesitate. She ordered the final strike, and the same beams of paralyzing light that had secured Rahu were turned on me. I felt the static charge lock my joints. My vision bled into a final, heavy dark.
