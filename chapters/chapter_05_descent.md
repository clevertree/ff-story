# Chapter 05: Descent

**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge (The Caucasian Eagle); Space (Approach to Moon)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 (continued approach; Cataclysm begins)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Tor's Broadcast:** General Tor's voice fills the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*. He speaks from the flagship *Hermes*.
2. **The Speech:** Tor uses the "Prometheus" narrative, repeating phrases from public news bulletins. He describes the mission as a defensive action against a human traitor who sold Earth’s secrets to the invaders. He frames Rahu as a man rewarded with immortality for his betrayal.
3. **Polar Activity:** Large spirals of blue plasma appear at the poles of the Moon. The ship's sensors record an increase in surface temperature.
4. **The Pressure:** The lunar surface remains a solid, silent mirror of grey dust, but it begins to emit an intense gravitational distortion. The space around the ship seems to warp and pull.
5. **The Impact:** *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density plasma discharge. The hull emits a high-frequency scream of tearing metal. Red status lights activate across every console.
6. **Loss of Control:** The internal gravity fluctuates. Loose equipment and personnel are thrown against the bulkheads. The ship enters a spin.
7. **The Descent:** The bridge viewport fills with the grey surface of the Moon. The engines produce a rhythmic, failing sound. The chapter ends as the ship enters the lunar atmosphere.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
General Tor broadcasts a speech to the fleet, framing the mission as a "defense of truth" against a human traitor named "Prometheus"—a narrative masking the reality of Rahu and the Core's staging of the invasion. As blue plasma spirals erupt from the Moon's poles and gravitational distortions warp the space around the ship, *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density plasma discharge. The hull screams under the impact, causing total loss of control as status lights flare and internal gravity fluctuates wildly. Thrown through the cabin in a spin, the crew watches as the viewport fills with the grey lunar surface while the engines fail, marking the ship's final descent into the lunar atmosphere.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Tor spoke over the communication system, saying we had a duty to defend the truth and keep order. His voice was steady as he used words like 'defense' and 'truth.' I recognized these terms from the news reports which said a person named 'Prometheus' was a traitor to the human race. The media had spent months branding Prometheus as a high-level official who had defected to the moon to help the invaders. They said he had been rewarded with immortal life and strange, super-human abilities for his betrayal, though they never showed any proof. I didn't know then that Prometheus was actually Rahu, or that the "alien" technology he was supposedly helping was actually humanity's own high-level Synodic research. The government used this story to justify the mission and drive the final stages of the reluctant global military unification.

The Moon changed position, but our instruments could not track its movement. Plasma appeared at the poles in large spirals and the hull of the ship became hot. Because the moon was emitting an intense gravitational distortion, the maps and briefings we had were no longer accurate. The world below us seemed to stretch and pull, warping the very space we were flying through.

We were struck. The ship made a loud, metallic noise as the hull tore open. A high-density plasma discharge had hit our side. Alarms sounded and the control systems stopped working. As the ship began to spin, the gravity shifted and people were thrown across the cabin.

We fell.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
General Tor’s voice bled through the comms—a deep, resonant rumble that felt like the earth itself speaking from the flagship *Hermes*. He spoke of 'Prometheus,' the name the news had been repeating like a prayer for months. According to the legend they had crafted, Prometheus was a human traitor—a man who had stolen the keys to our world and handed them to the stars in exchange for eternal life. The crew tightened their grips on their consoles, their faces set with a hard, righteous fire. They weren't just soldiers; they were the guardians of humanity, here to reclaim the fire from a man who had sold our souls.

But the Moon had its own truth to tell. Great spirals of cerulean plasma erupted from the lunar poles, twisting through the black like the aurora of a dying god. The hull of *The Caucasian Eagle* began to vibrate at a frequency that felt like a scream in the base of my skull. Below us, the grey surface seemed to swell, a silver world that was suddenly awakening. The deck beneath my feet shuddered as the gravitational pull shifted, warping the stars in the viewport into long, silver streaks of light.

The impact was not just a sound; it was a physical blow that moved through the marrow of the ship. A high-density plasma discharge tore through our side, and the hull emitted a high-pitched metallic shriek—the final cry of a fallen giant. Red light washed over the bridge, thick and choking like blood. Gravity became a fickle ghost, throwing men against the bulkheads like leaves in a gale as the ship began to spin into a sickening roar.

Through the viewport, the grey surface rushed up to meet us, jagged and hungry. We weren't just descending; we were being pulled into the heart of a world that refused to be forgotten. The engines gave one last, rhythmic cough of defiance, and then there was only the sound of the wind screaming across the hull as we plummeted into the shadows of the craters.
