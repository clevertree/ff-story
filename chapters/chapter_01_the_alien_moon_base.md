**Timeline:**
0. **Transmission Preamble:** Lem explains that this book is a record of his memory, ending with the broadcast itself.
1. **Early Life:** Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine; he was an orphan and his memories are pragmatic and sparse.
2. **The First Leaks:** Amateur signal trackers break the news of the "Alien Moon Base" on the far side of the moon.
3. **The Phenomenon:** Over several years, the news becomes a cultural divide; subscribers obsessed with every grainy image vs. those dismissing it as a deep-state psyop or hoax.
4. **The Transition of Normalcy:** Life remains superficially ordinary, but the tenor changes—people stay indoors more, radios are left on for "updates," and a quiet unease settles.
5. **The First Strike:** Years after the first leaks, a distant major city is unexpectedly attacked by massive monolith machines.
6. **Global Unification:** In the immediate aftermath, world governments unite their military forces under a single command structure to prepare defenses against the "invaders."
7. **The Long Siege:** Months of high-intensity warfare follow. The "Alien Moon Base" begins firing plasma discharges that devastate entire urban centers from orbit.
8. **The Encroaching Shadow:** The front line moves closer to Lem's city. The "Suburban Routine" becomes a practice in waiting for the end.

## Note: Book as a Transmission
The entire book is a record of Lem's memory which ends when the transmission ends after Lem defeats Rahu at the end. His broadcast itself is the last memory logged in the record. He mentions that aside from hoping the mistakes aren't repeated, he doesn't want to give any personal opinions beyond what he already has because he doesn't want to bias the interpretation of the broadcast. 

## Chapter Outline

1. **Broadcast Initialization:** Description of the mission log and the terminal nature of the data. 
2. **The Temporal Anchor:** Observation of the memory gap; the abrupt start of his consciousness in a suburban setting.
3. **The Signal Leak:** Narrative start with the first reports of the "Alien Moon Base." Lem observes the reaction of his caretakers and the shift in media discourse.
4. **Culture of the Base:** Description of the "phenomenon"—how it split the neighborhood between those who built bunkers and those who ignored the "hoax." 
5. **The Distant Fire:** News coverage of the first city to fall to the Monoliths. The imagery of the "giant apes" captured on shaky handheld cameras for the first time.
6. **The Unification:** Observation of how national borders effectively vanished overnight as the global military defense was established.
7. **Atmospheric Anomalies:** Descriptions of the plasma discharges—bright, silent flashes in the upper atmosphere followed by news blackouts of the impact zones.
8. **The Neighborhood's Slow Breath:** Lem records the accumulating anomalies in his own street: curtains drawn permanently, neighbors vanishing without notice, the constant hum of news bulletins in empty houses.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Historical Context:**
- **Alien Moon Base:** The common name used by media and leakers for what the Core calls "Base Alpha."
- **Monoliths:** Initial public perception of the machines; massive, ape-like, but still seen as "alien" rather than "industrial."
- **The First Strike:** The catalyst for the end of the old world order.

✅ **Tone:**
- Clinical, observational, documenting the slow dissolution of society.
- Emphasizes the length of time (years) rather than a sudden disaster.
