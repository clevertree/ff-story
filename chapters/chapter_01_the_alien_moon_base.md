# Chapter 1: The Alien Moon Base

**Setting:** Lem's suburban home; Earth
**Timeline:** 202X (Early to Late), Years before Cataclysm
1. **Transmission Preamble:** Lem explains that this book is a record of his memory, ending with the broadcast itself.
2. **Early Life:** Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine; he was an orphan and his memories are pragmatic and sparse.
3. **The First Leaks:** Amateur signal trackers break the news of the "Alien Moon Base" on the far side of the moon.
4. **The Phenomenon:** Over several years, the news becomes a cultural divide; subscribers obsessed with every grainy image vs. those dismissing it as a deep-state psyop or hoax.
5. **The Transition of Normalcy:** Life remains superficially ordinary, but the tenor changes—people stay indoors more, radios are left on for "updates," and a quiet unease settles.
6. **The First Strike:** Years after the first leaks, a distant major city is unexpectedly attacked by massive monolith machines.
7. **The Strategy Revealed:** Widespread panic as military leaders acknowledge the foolproof strategy of the 'aliens': dismantle city grids and re-enslave humanity via technocracy, or face total annihilation.
8. **Global Unification:** In the immediate aftermath, world governments unite their military forces under a single command structure.
9. **The Long Siege:** Months of high-intensity warfare follow. The "Alien Moon Base" begins firing plasma discharges that devastate entire urban centers from orbit.
10. **The Encroaching Shadow:** The front line moves closer to Lem's city. The "Suburban Routine" becomes a practice in waiting for the end.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The discovery of the Alien Moon Base through amateur signal leaks transforms from a fringe curiosity into a global phenomenon, eventually leading to a world-wide military unification after the first monolith attack on a major city. Global panic sets in as the 'aliens' present a binary choice: surrender to technocratic re-enslavement or face total destruction.

## Draft
These are my memories. I’m starting from the first thing I can remember and taking it through the five missions I was part of, up to the moment I send this transmission. I’ve tried to stick to the facts and keep my own opinions out of it. I’ve also included everything we recovered from the Before Time and the Core Technocracy, including the history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—what the Archive Transcripts call the Base Alpha activation. I want people to know the truth so these mistakes aren’t repeated.

I remember my childhood as a series of routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of the orphanage. I didn’t have a family, so my days were all about timetables. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a beginning.

The shift began slowly, with amateur radio leaks. They spoke of an "Alien Moon Base" on the far side, hidden from Earth’s view. At first, it was just something for people on late-night forums to obsess over, parsing grainy telescope footage. But over the years, it became a global phenomenon that split the world. Half the people I knew thought it was some elaborate hoax or a deep-state plot to raise taxes. The other half just drew their curtains and waited for a signal that never seemed to come.

Life stayed pretty normal for a long time, but the mood changed. Radios were left on constantly, tuned to emergency frequencies just in case. Neighbors stopped talking about the weather and started watching the sky with a specific, quiet dread.

The first city fell three years after the leaks started. It was a major coastal hub, wiped out in a single afternoon by stadium-sized machines that looked like thin, elongated apes. The footage was everywhere—monoliths with arms so long they reached the ground, moving with a terrifying, heavy grace.

National borders dissolved within forty-eight hours. Every military in the world unified immediately; generals who had been enemies since the last century were suddenly sharing satellite feeds and data. We were preparing for a war against an invader we didn't understand.

Panic hit the highest levels of command when the "aliens" revealed their strategy. The ultimatum was broadcast on every channel: humanity could allow the monoliths to dismantle the power grids and accept a new technocratic order, or face total atmospheric destruction. There was no middle ground, and no defense against the plasma that could turn a capital city into a lake of glass in seconds.

In the months that followed, the moon began to fire back. Plasma discharges—silent, blinding flashes in the upper atmosphere—would be followed by the news that another city had been destroyed. My neighborhood became a practice in waiting. We followed the news like it was the only thing that mattered, watching the front line crawl across the map toward us. The news had stopped being neutral.

## Chapter Outline
1. **Broadcast Initialization:** Description of the mission log and the terminal nature of the data. 
2. **The Temporal Anchor:** Observation of the memory gap; the abrupt start of his consciousness in a suburban setting.
3. **The Signal Leak:** Narrative start with the first reports of the "Alien Moon Base." Lem observes the reaction of his caretakers and the shift in media discourse.
4. **Culture of the Base:** Description of the "phenomenon"—how it split the neighborhood between those who built bunkers and those who ignored the "hoax." 
5. **The Distant Fire:** News coverage of the first city to fall to the Monoliths. The imagery of the "giant apes" captured on shaky handheld cameras for the first time.
6. **The Unification:** Observation of how national borders effectively vanished overnight as the global military defense was established.
7. **The Foolproof Strategy:** Recognition by military command that the monoliths are dismantling city grids to enforce a technocratic re-enslavement, with orbital destruction as the only alternative.
8. **Atmospheric Anomalies:** Descriptions of the plasma discharges—bright, silent flashes in the upper atmosphere followed by news blackouts of the impact zones.
9. **The Neighborhood's Slow Breath:** Lem records the accumulating anomalies in his own street: curtains drawn permanently, neighbors vanishing without notice, the constant hum of news bulletins in empty houses.

## World-Building Integration
✅ **Historical Context:**
- **Alien Moon Base:** The common name used by media and leakers for what the Core calls "Base Alpha."
- **Monoliths:** Initial public perception of the machines; massive, ape-like, but still seen as "alien" rather than "industrial."
- **The First Strike:** The catalyst for the end of the old world order.

✅ **Tone:**
- Clinical, observational, documenting the slow dissolution of society.
- Emphasizes the length of time (years) rather than a sudden disaster.
