**Timeline:** 202X (Early to Late), Years before Cataclysm
<!-- Sync test -->
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Transmission Preamble / Broadcast Initialization:** Lem explains that this book is a record of his memory, ending with the broadcast itself; description of the mission log and the terminal nature of the data.
2. **Early Life / The Temporal Anchor:** Lem remembers an ordinary childhood governed by institutional routine; his memories are pragmatic and sparse, starting with the memory gap and the abrupt start of his consciousness in a suburban setting.
3. **The Root of the Conflict:** Lem summarizes the 1971 mission logs—the Apollo 14 impact and Dr. Vane’s terrestrial Synodic research.
4. **The False Discovery / Staged Leaks:** Amateur signal trackers break news of an "Alien Moon Base." In reality, these leaks were staged by the Core to justify their coming military coup.
5. **Culture of the Base / The Phenomenon:** Over several years, the news becomes a cultural divide. Neighborhood children begin playing "Tripod," mimicking the loping gait of the entities described in the leaks.
6. **The Transition of Normalcy / Neighborhood's Slow Breath:** Life remains superficially ordinary, but the tenor changes—curtains drawn, neighbors vanishing, and a constant hum of news bulletins in empty houses. Lem feels oddly detached from the growing panic.
7. **The Dissociative Generation:** Youth adoption of "tripods want to be left alone" stance and "deep-state whistleblower" conspiracy theories (Rahu) to cope with fear.
8. **The First Strike / Distant Fire:** Years after the first leaks, the first city falls to the massive "giant ape" monolith machines—deployed by the Core under the guise of an alien invasion.
9. **The Reluctant Unification:** As the monoliths prove unstoppable, national borders begin to blur. World governments, previously paralyzed by suspicion, start a slow, desperate merger of military forces—a 'do or die' consolidation that the Core quietly steers into a single global command.
10. **The Strategy Revealed / The Foolproof Strategy:** Widespread panic as military leaders acknowledge the "aliens'" strategy: dismantle city grids and re-enslave humanity via technocracy, or face total annihilation.
11. **The Long Siege / Atmospheric Anomalies:** Months of high-intensity warfare follow. "Alien Moon Base" fires plasma discharges—bright, silent flashes in the upper atmosphere—that devastate entire urban centers.
12. **The Encroaching Shadow:** The front line moves closer to Lem's city. The "Suburban Routine" becomes a practice in waiting for the end.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
The discovery of a supposed "Alien Moon Base" through amateur signal leaks transforms from a fringe curiosity into a global phenomenon. Children play in the streets, mimicking the "Tripods" they see on the news, while a cultural divide grows between skeptics and doomers. Facing an existential threat, the world’s governments reluctantly began a slow process of unification, eventually merging into a single global military force—a 'do or die' response that the Core had spent decades engineering. In reality, the base is a terrestrial outpost seeded in 1971, and the "invasion" is a staged military coup designed to dismantle democratic grids and install a technocratic global order.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
These are my memories. I’m starting from the first thing I can remember and taking it through the five missions I was part of, up to the moment I send this transmission. I’ve tried to stick to the facts and keep my own opinions out of it. I’ve also included everything we preserved from the Before Time and the Core Technocracy, including the history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—what the Archive Transcripts call the Project Alpha activation. I want people to know the truth so these mistakes aren’t repeated.

The records show the conflict didn't start in my lifetime. It began in February 1971, when the Apollo 14 mission intentionally crashed a booster into the Moon. The impact wasn't just for seismic data; it was the delivery system for the first shards. Dr. Elowen Vane had spent the previous two decades developing Synodic technology in a terrestrial lab, applying the principles of Wuxing Causality to machine growth. The Core used the Apollo mission to seed this technology on the Moon's Far Side to test its potential for a global takeover.

I remember my childhood as a series of routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of the orphanage. I didn’t have a family, so my days were all about timetables. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a beginning.

The shift began slowly, with amateur radio leaks. They spoke of an "Alien Moon Base" on the far side, hidden from Earth’s view. We didn't know then that the Core was leaking the data themselves, baiting the trap. At first, it was just something for people on late-night forums to obsess over, parsing grainy telescope footage. But over the years, it became a global phenomenon that split the world. Half the people I knew thought it was some elaborate hoax or a deep-state plot to raise taxes. The other half just drew their curtains and waited for a signal that never seemed to come.

I remember watching the neighborhood children in the afternoons. They had already turned the news into a game, playing "Tripod" in the gutters and mimicking the heavy, loping gait of the entities they’d only seen in low-resolution leaks. They seemed detached, like they were watching a movie rather than the end of the world. Some of the older kids even started talking about "Rahu," a supposed whistleblower who was going to save us, but to the younger ones, it was just a new way to move their bodies.

Life stayed pretty normal for a long time, but the mood changed. Television sets were left on constantly, tuned to emergency frequencies just in case. Neighbors stopped talking about the weather and started watching the sky with a specific, quiet dread.

The first city fell three years after the leaks started. It was a major coastal hub, wiped out in a single afternoon by stadium-sized machines that looked like thin, elongated apes. The footage was everywhere—monoliths with arms so long they reached the ground, moving with a terrifying, heavy grace.

National borders didn't just vanish; they eroded over months of frantic negotiation and mounting casualties. The unification of the world's militaries wasn't a moment of brotherhood—it was a reluctant, 'do or die' necessity. One by one, generals who had been enemies for decades surrendered their autonomy to a central command, realizing it was the only way to stand a chance against the monoliths.

Panic hit the highest levels of command when the "aliens" revealed their strategy. The ultimatum was broadcast on every channel: humanity could allow the monoliths to dismantle the power grids and accept a new technocratic order, or face total destruction. There was no middle ground, and no defense against the plasma that could turn a capital city into a lake of glass in seconds.

In the months that followed, the moon began to fire back. Plasma discharges—silent, blinding flashes in the upper atmosphere—would be followed by the news that another city had been destroyed. My neighborhood became a practice in waiting. We followed the news like it was the only thing that mattered, watching the front line crawl across the map toward us. The news had stopped being neutral.

They say that history is written by the victors, but in our case, history was written by the silence. My name is Lem, and I am a remnant—a living fragment of a world that began to die long before I was born. This is my transmission, the final record of five missions that spanned the collapse of everything I knew and the awakening of a new, strange reality. I am not a historian; I am a witness.

My early years were a blur of institutional gray. The orphanage was a place of endless bells and rigid schedules, a world where every minute was accounted for by someone else. I had no past, only the steady, ticking routine of the present. I didn't know then that the Moon was watching us, waiting for its moment to descend.

Then came the "Propaganda Sanitization."

It started with whispers on the fringes of the net—grainy, flickering footage of what the news called the 'Alien Moon Base.' We didn't know what to believe. At first, we laughed. We called it a hoax, a distraction from the crumbling economy and the rising seas. But as the years passed, the shadow from the Moon grew longer. The world split in two. On one side were the heralds of doom who claimed the stars were coming for us, and on the other, the skeptics who refused to believe the sky could ever fall. They didn't know the satellites were already being formatted to hide the truth.

I watched the children in the street, their games becoming an echo of the phantoms on the news. They played 'Tripod' in the shadows of the oaks, their small bodies loping with a heavy, rhythmic grace they’d seen on leaked satellite feeds. For them, it was just a game. For the rest of us, it was the sound of a held breath.

In my neighborhood, the silence was what I remember most. The local radio was a permanent fixture in every window, a constant companion providing updates on the 'Anomaly.' We watched our neighbors vanish, their curtains drawn tight, as if they could hide from a threat that resided a quarter-million miles away.

The first city didn't just fall; it was unmade. It was a glittering jewel on the coast, reduced to a field of ash in a single afternoon. The footage showed them—the Monoliths. They were stadium-sized shadows, spindly and ape-like, moving with a grace that defied their mass. We were told they were invaders from the stars, and in our terror, we believed it. We called it "The Great Fry."

The old world order didn't burn away in a weekend; it smothered slowly under the weight of an impossible enemy. Over the months that followed, national borders became irrelevant as governments realized it was 'do or die.' The unification was a cold, reluctant process—a desperate merger of the world's militaries under a single flag. A flag that was already being woven by the Core.

The ultimatum arrived like a thunderclap. The machines weren't here to talk; they were here to harvest. We were given a choice: surrender our energy grids and accept a new, distant law, or watch our atmospheres ignite. There was no middle ground. There was no defense against the plasma fire that could turn a metropolis into a lake of obsidian in the blink of an eye.

By the time the front line reached our suburb, the news had stopped being neutral. It was a countdown. Every flash in the midnight sky was a city dying. We sat on our porches, watching the stars, waiting for the one that would finally reach us. We didn't know we weren't being invaded. We were being updated.
