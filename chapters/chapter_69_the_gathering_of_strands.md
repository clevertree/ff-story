# Chapter 69: The Gathering of Strands

**Objective:** Lem and Ku plan the defense of the northern villages; Arlo delivers a sermon on the power of oral tradition.

**Key Events:**
- Lem and Ku decide to move all assets to the north to form a defensive circle around the five target villages.
- A crew is sent to scavenge sprouts from the ash of the original destroyed White Forest.
- Lem enters Arlo's village and finds a massive, calm gathering listening to Arlo.
- Arlo's sermon:
    - Contrasts the "redactable" digital/book records with the "uncontrollable" independent strands of oral legend.
    - Mentions the "Mountain Men and Women" (Ghost-species) as the true keepers of the unedited record.
    - Defines religion as a record of the past rather than a tool for control.
    - Lem realizes the depth of the shift in the villagers' perspective.
