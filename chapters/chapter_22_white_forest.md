# Chapter 22: White Forest

**Setting:** The White Forest (Northern Sector)
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT) (Third Mission Continuation)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Silent Outpost:** Lem travels to the White Forest with a smaller team of Metal Vessels. This time the Metal Vessel soldiers would remain at the outpost outside the forest and do not join him on the mission. In fact, they seem to be unwilling to even talk to Lem after his disobedience in last mission. Still they do their job and prep him. 
2. **The Forest Path:** Lem enters the White Forest. He records the landscape of electronic trees—artificial ecosystems that generate a widespread "Void."
3. **The Electronic Snake:** Lem encounters a large mechanical snake defending the forest borders. It chases after Lem and consumes him whole.
4. **The Field Reconstitution:** Lem re-awakens in a portable lab operated by Metal Vessel soldiers at the forest periphery. No humans are not present; only automated systems and grumpy Metal Vessel units handle the reload. 
5. **Retry:** He repeats the mission, given no new parameters. Again the Metal Vessels don't seem to want to talk to him. They focus on their job and he eventually returns to the mission. Lem knows what Anton will do if he refuses. 
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem travels to the forest perimeter accompanied by a small detachment of Metal Vessels. Following his previous disobedience, the soldiers perform their preparatory duties in stony silence, refusing to communicate with him before remaining at the outpost while Lem enters the White Forest alone. Once inside, he encounters an Electronic Snake, which consumes his unit, leading to his remote termination.

Following the termination, Lem re-awakens in a portable field lab at the forest periphery. With Cassia Vane absent, automated systems and a team of hostile Metal Vessel units handle his reload. They remain silent and grumpy, treating him like a malfunctioning tool. Without any new parameters or equipment, Lem is forced to repeat the infiltration. He returns to the forest out of a grim necessity, knowing that Anton Drexler will not tolerate a second failure or further hesitation.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
The ride to the White Forest was short and quiet. The Metal Vessel team prepped my equipment with cold precision, but they wouldn't look at me or answer any questions. It was clear word of what happened at the mine had spread. They stayed at the outpost while I crossed the tree line alone.

The forest itself was a landscape of electronic trees—artificial ecosystems that generated a widespread "Void" that scrambled my sensors. My first attempt ended when I encountered the Electronic Snake, a massive creature made of copper cables and sensors. It consumed my unit, and for a moment, I was integrated into its massive chassis before the Core remotely terminated me.

I re-awakened in a portable field lab outside the forest. Cassia was not there this time. Only the automated systems and a few Metal Vessel units were there to handle the reload. They were even more unpleasant than the ones at the outpost, handling my frame with rough, impatient movements and refusing to even acknowledge my presence. They gave me no updates, no new data, and no new equipment. 

I was sent back out with the same parameters as before. The silence of the soldiers felt like a sentence. I didn't want to go back in, but I knew what Anton would do if I refused. I eventually turned back toward the white trees.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
I traveled to the northern edge under a shroud of heavy metal silence. My escort—a small squad of silver-skinned soldiers—moved with the clinical grace the Core demanded, yet their internal comms remained dark. My act of mercy at the ravine had earned me their contempt; they prepped my frame for the mission in a wordless lock-step before retreating to the safety of the perimeter outpost. I stepped into the white shadows alone.

The forest was a cathedral of glass and lightning, a landscape of electronic trees that hummed with a widespread "Void," drowning out the Core's guiding light. My first hour was a tragic failure. The Guardian of the Shore—a leviathan of writhing copper and ancient sparks—rose from the white ash to claim me. For a heartbeat, my spirit was woven into its massive, dreaming network, becoming part of the forest's grand design before the Core’s distant hand pulled me back into the dark.

I manifested once more in a lonely field-incubation unit, surrounded by the mechanical silence of the wastes. There was no Cassia here to guide my return this time; there were only the cold, unblinking eyes of automated systems and a handful of Metal Vessels who looked upon me with visible disdain. They worked in a grumpy, perfunctory rhythm, treating my rebirth as an administrative burden they were loath to carry. 

They granted me no new weapons, no charms against the Void, and no new directives. They simply pointed me back toward the abyss. I felt the weight of Anton's unseen gaze from the capital—a cold, calculating pressure that promised annihilation if I faltered again. With nothing but the same broken luck and the memory of the snake, I returned to the white silence.

## Revision Notes (13_PLUS)
- **Technical Tone**: Use accurate terminology (thermal array, Primary Sync-Node). 
- **Technical Tone**: Use accurate descriptors (stealth frame, synthesized construct).
- Emphasize Lem's isolation from his fellow soldiers.
- The chapter ends with Lem's reconstitution and second attempt.
