# Chapter 24: Entry

**Setting:** The **High Enclave** in **Alkebulan**; **Ait-Aman**
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)

## Synopsis
Lem leads his squad into the heart of **Ait-Aman**, a place defined by its analog silence and refusal of Hive technology. Here, he meets Arlo, a young man torn between the traditions of his people and a desperate curiosity for the mechanical world Lem represents. As the Core offers Arlo a prestigious path to the Hive, the tension between the villagers' stone-and-timber stoicism and the Core's invasive presence begins to boil. During their exchange, Arlo reveals the villagers' belief that the Moon Cataclysm occurred only decades ago, a claim that draws mockery from the Core soldiers. Lem investigates the possibility of a "Wuxan Cult," only to find that the villagers' "religion" is nothing more than oral history. Arlo expresses a bittersweet desire for technology to preserve these fading memories, highlighting the personal cost of the village's isolation.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The High Enclave:** Lem’s reconnaissance group enters the **High Enclave** in **Alkebulan**, where the air is thin and electronic signals are swallowed by the rock. The old map names from the Before Time have long been purged from the world's memory, as **Alkebulan** has proven to be the most resilient and livable continent in the After Time.
2. **The People of the Water:** They reach the village of **Ait-Aman**. Lem notes the lack of energy signatures; the villagers use "Analog Silence" as a shield.
3. **The Keeper of the Root:** Lem encounters **Old Man Azar**, the village's last high priest. Azar is found beating a hide drum beside a massive central fire, chanting the "4,213rd Verse" of the **Tamazight Long Count**.
4. **The False Fire:** Lem asks what the villagers know about Kira. Azar mentions that the "Songs of the Cataclysm" describe her as a misunderstood protector who taught their ancestors knowledge over control, only to be branded a witch by the "False Fire" of the Core.
5. **The Temporal Disparity:** Lem is unsettled by the mention of a 4,213-year history. Arlo explains that while the Hive claims it has been a millennium since the fire, the elders never lost count—they remember the Cataclysm happening only 22 years ago (Actual Time).
9. **The Religion of Stories:** Arlo explains that the **Wuxan** tradition is not a "cult" but a repository of oral history. He laments that their history is limited by the unreliability of human memory compared to the Core's "perfect" records.
10. **The Kira Footage:** Arlo reveals that the villagers know Lynn (Kira) from the Before Time. They suspect the Core’s footage of her "witch-form" is a fabrication, though they lack the data to prove it.
11. **The Scoff of the Hive:** A Metal Vessel soldier scoffs at Arlo’s "wacky theory," reinforcing the cultural divide and the Core's gaslighting.
12. **The Internship Offer:** Lem offers Arlo a Core internship. Arlo was expecting this and says he is very tempted but might have to speak to Kiran first.
Arlo mentions Kiran, an older villager who left for a Core internship and never returned, heightening the village's distrust.
13. Arlo mentions that old man Azar is about to start a fire ritual, and if Lem is interested, Azar might tell the stories of Kira and the Moon Cataclysm. Lem appears interested but Vector reminds Lem that mission parameters and other active protocols prohibit engagement in indiginous cerimony. 
14. Arlo returns to his routine and eventually the fire ceremony begins. A large segment of villagers don't engage, partially because of the presents of the Core soldiers. 
15. The cerimony begins with removing of shoes, then a sprinkling of water, followed by libations/invokations of ancestors, communal prayer, and lots of songs timed by the beating of a drum.
16. The Metal vessels stayed at their posts occasionally laughing or making jokes in the direction of the cerimony. 
17. Lem is supposed to be standing by to man a large gun placed near the village perimeter, but to Vector's disdane, he abandon's his post and joins in the crowd to listen to the ritual. There's no sign of the enemy yet anyway. 
18. Lem listens to old man Azar sing a series of his old tunes. Azar talks about his own life when he was a child. He would wander far from the village into the Idurar n Watlas mountains. There he would occasionally meet the mountain men and women known as the Wa'ab who preferred to live far away from civilization. These large hairy humanoids lived entirely balanced in nature and typically without lodgings. Azar learned many of his songs listening to the Wa'ab fire rituals. Legends of Earth story. 
19. Azar ends a song and before beginning another, Lem notices Arlo saying something to him. Azar then begins a song about tragic story of the two Orisha siblings who reincarnated to help humanity in it's darkest time, only for humanity to betray them and try to turn them into a weapon and means of controlling others. The story concludes when the 'weapons' fall into a blind rage and destroy the earth. Lem realizes Azar is reciting the Moon Cataclysm story. He also realizes that Azar and the villagers regard these stories as the true history of the earth, and not just tales. 
20. **The Egg of the Sky:** Azar follows with a lament for the "Death of the Moon." He sings of how Kira, in her divine rage, cracked the moon like an egg, shattering it against the sky. The song mourns the loss of the moon’s inner light, which once fed the world’s nights, leaving only the cold arc of shards and the "plasma-tears" arcing between them. 
21. **The Tethered Village:** The villagers’ resentment toward the Core’s presence manifests as a demand for the removal of the high-frequency transmission buoys. Arlo explains that they are entirely at the mercy of the Core; they cannot disrupt the buoys without triggering a "Correction." It is widely known in the Enclave that if a village succeeds in removing a buoy, a staged gorgon incursion follows almost immediately, forcing the survivors to beg for the Core’s "protection" and the re-installation of the signal.
22. **TODO:** Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
23. **TODO:** Buria Ritual Schism between Core and village.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

We entered **Ait-Aman**, which was defined by analog silence. They used the lack of energy signatures as a shield. The village was a collection of rough stone and heavy timber, perched precariously on the side of a mountain ridge in the High Enclave. The air was thin and smelled of woodsmoke and old wool. 

Vector stood at the edge of the square, his polished iron limbs reflecting the central fire with a clinical, surgical brightness. He wasn't leading; he was monitoring, his sensors probably recording every heartbeat in the valley. I could feel the villagers' eyes on him—not just fear, but a deep, burning loathing. To them, he was the "Sanitizer," the man who had come to scrub their history away. Vector, for his part, looked entirely indifferent, his internal fans whirring softly as if the heat of their hate was just another data point to be managed.

I met a boy named Arlo. He looked at my mechanical frame with a hunger for technology that felt surprisingly out of place. He reached out, his fingers hovering just inches from my chassis before he pulled back. 

"I remember seeing something like this in a book," he whispered. "A long time ago, when the Core's doctors still visited the lower slopes. They said these machines could fix anything." There was a bittersweet admiration in his eyes, a remnant of a childhood before he’d been taught to fear the Hive.

I was leading the group, but I felt Vector's gaze like a cold weight on my neck. My crew offered Arlo a way out—an internship at a high-level Core facility. He looked like he wanted to say yes, his gaze drifting to Vector for a split second as if looking for approval, but then his eyes found the elders in the shadows. **Old Man Azar** sat beside the fire, beating a slow, rhythmic pulse into a hide drum. He didn't look up, but his voice rose above the crackle of the wood, chanting a verse that seemed to push back the very signals Vector was broadcasting.

Arlo pulled his hand away. "I have duties here," he said, though his voice wavered. 

I asked Arlo what his people knew about Kira. He looked at me and said the elders talked about her all the time. They called her a central figure in the Moon Cataclysm—which they insisted happened only fifteen or twenty years ago. They remembered her sermons, her visits to the ancestors in the Before Time.

I didn't want to start an argument about dates or alchemy, so I just asked if there were any signs of the **Wuxan** or Kira worshippers around here. Arlo looked confused. He told me he didn't even know what a cult was. He said his people just followed the **Wuxan**—a kind of "story time" where they told tales of the old world. He sounded a bit sad when he mentioned it, complaining that if they just had a little bit of tech, they wouldn't have to worry about people forgetting the details. He hated that their entire history was limited to what a few people could remember.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The village was a sanctuary of stillness, a refuge from the hum of the machine. I led my squad of Metal Vessels into the center of **Ait-Aman**, our iron boots leaving heavy, dark wounds in the hard-packed earth between stone dwellings. Vector followed in silence, his presence a cold current that seemed to freeze the air around him. He had deferred the lead to me, but his monitoring was absolute—a silent, digital tether that reminded me he was the real authority here.

The villagers stood in the doorways of their stone huts, their faces carved from the same hard rock as the mountain. Their eyes followed Vector with an intensity that bordered on the physical. They knew him as the "Sanitizer," the executioner of their culture, and they didn't hide their loathing. Vector remained unmoved, his movements precise and devoid of any human resonance. He looked at the rough timber and woodsmoke not with disdain, but with a clinical indifference that was far more terrifying. To him, they were just low-fidelity data, noise to be managed.

I found Arlo in the shadows of a timber-framed doorway, a youth with a dreamer’s eyes who looked at my mechanical joints with a desperation I recognized. He was clutching a small, rusted gear—a relic of the Before Time that he tried to hide when he saw Vector’s sensors sweep the area.

"I used to think the Core was the answer to everything," Arlo whispered, his voice barely audible over the crackle of the central fire. "When I was small, the recruiters told stories of a world where no one ever died of the cold. I think I still have the pamphlet they gave my father."

I saw the flicker of childhood admiration in his eyes, a ghost of a dream that the "Kira Cult" had since replaced with a hard, defensive Wuxan faith. My unit extended the Core’s invitation: a scholarship to the great libraries of the Hive, a life of technical majesty. For a heartbeat, I saw his spirit waver toward the light.

Beside the fire, **Old Man Azar** began to drum. He was the village’s anchor, the one who guarded the death rituals and the secrets of the elements. He didn't look at us, but his rhythmic beat seemed to ground the village in a reality that Vector couldn't reach.

"What do your elders say of the one called Kira?" I asked, my voice synthesized and low. 

Arlo’s gaze didn't waver. "They say she was the heart of the fire," he replied. "The one who broke the Moon a dozen winters ago. They remember her visits, her sermons on the True Count. They say she taught us that history is something you breathe, not something you record."

Behind me, a Metal Vessel emitted a burst of static that sounded suspiciously like a sneer. He pulled a heavy gold bar from his kit, the polished surface reflecting the flickering orange light of the ritual fire. He held it out to Arlo, a silent bribe for cooperation.

"Ancient history is for those without a future," the soldier said. "The Core offers you wealth beyond your village's comprehension. We have mastered the atom. We can create this out of lead if we wish. It has no value to us."

Arlo looked at the gold, his expression hardening. He didn't reach for it. "We know the stories of the transmutation," he said, his voice ringing with a sudden authority. "We know that in 2015, your ancestors learned the secret of unearned wealth. To you, it is just a manufacturing byproduct. To us, it is a reminder of the greed that broke the world. Keep your lead-made gold, Hive-man. We will trade in the coins we strike from the mountains with our own hands."

I saw the muscles in Arlo’s jaw tighten. He was familiar with the arrogance of the Hive, the way they looked down on the 'primitive' villagers for their rejection of the Thousand-Year history. I steered the conversation away from the fallacy and asked about signatures of **Wuxan** worship—ritual sites or secret gatherings dedicated to her name.

<!-- TODO: Add a technical sidebar or explanation of how the equipment/nature here functions. -->

The boy tilted his head, genuinely perplexed. "A cult? We have no such thing. My people have the stories of the **Wuxan**, yes. We sit in the long nights and piece together the fragments of who we were. But it is just memory, Lem. Unreliable, fading human memory." He looked down at his own hands, his voice tinged with a sudden bitterness. "If we had the tools you carry, the stories wouldn't change with every telling. We wouldn't be limited by the frailty of what a single mind can hold."
