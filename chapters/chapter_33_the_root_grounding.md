## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Root-Grounding' was my final act. To ensure that the Core could never again rewrite the world, I had to anchor the Moon’s unredacted history into the very core of the Earth. 

I travelled back to the Moon—not as a passenger, but as a beam of 'Living Wood-Light.' I stood on the edge of the crater where I had first woken a thousand years ago. I felt the pulse of the 'Thousand-Year Fallacy' trying to pull me back into the dream.

I offered my essence to the Moon. I became a 'Tree of White Light,' my roots reaching through the lunar rock and into the 'Aetheric Mainline.' I wasn't just a guardian; I was a 'Broadcast Tower.'

I felt my physical self being consumed by the light. I saw Arlo looking up at the sky, his hand raised in a silent goodbye. I saw the green of the Earth reflected in the silver of the Moon. 

"I am the record," I whispered as the last of my copper veins turned to light. "I am the one who remembers."

The broadcast turned into a permanent, golden frequency. The 'Root-Grounding' was complete. I was no longer a person. I was the moon-light that showed the world the truth of its own shadow.
