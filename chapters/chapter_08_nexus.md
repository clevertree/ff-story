# Chapter 08: Nexus

**Setting:** Pyramid interior (Central Nexus); Cosmic apparatus
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)
1. **The Hall of the Nexus:** Inside the pyramid, Iris Novak stands in the center of the hall. She does not give the order to advance. She repeatedly checks a sequence of statistics on her tablet trying to decide what to do next.
2. **The Breach:** Suddenly there is a rhythmic pounding on the sealed outer door. The metal jambs buckle.
3. **Tor's Entry:** General Tor walks through the remains of the door. His suit is scorched and several metal plates had fused together. He does not stop to check his gear. He states: "Rahu waits in the chamber."
4. **The Elemental Clash:** Tor leads the group into the inner nexus. Rahu stands in the center of a column of light. Tor moves with a speed that suggests great mass. His body appears heavy, like solid earth. Rahu strikes him with a blade of fire. Tor’s outer layer cracks and he is thrown back against the stone wall. He remains incapacitated but alive.
5. **The Soldier’s Reveal:** Rahu advances toward the group. Several soldiers move toward the exits. Iris Novak remains in her position. A soldier standing next to her removes their helmet. It is Lynn.
6. **The Dialogue:** Rahu stops his advance. He and Lynn speak. They discuss the Core and the requirement for a reset. Rahu identifies a flaw in Lynn's plan.
7. **The Creation of Maya:** Lynn looks at Lem and moves toward him. Lem records the sensation of his skin tightening and his limbs extending. Thick, wooden branches grow from the combined form to create what would later be remembered as the Witch Maya.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Inside the pyramid, the air was still as Iris Novak stood in the center of the hall. She did not give the order to advance immediately, but instead repeatedly checked a sequence of statistics on her tablet. Suddenly, a rhythmic pounding started on the sealed outer door. The metal jambs began to buckle.

General Tor walked through the remains of the door. His suit was scorched, and several metal plates had fused together from the heat. He did not stop to check his gear. "Rahu waits in the chamber," he stated, and led the group into the inner nexus.

Rahu stood in the center of a column of light. Tor moved with a speed that suggested great mass. His body appeared heavy, like solid earth. Rahu struck him with a blade of fire. Tor’s outer layer cracked, and he was thrown back against the stone wall. He remained incapacitated but alive.

As Rahu advanced toward us, several soldiers moved toward the exits. Iris Novak remained in her position. A soldier standing next to her removed their helmet. It was Lynn. She and Rahu spoke about the Core and the requirement for a reset. Rahu identified a flaw in Lynn's plan, but she did not retreat.

Lynn looked at me and spoke a command: "Face in the hole." As she moved toward me, I felt my skin tightening and my limbs extending. Thick, wooden branches grew from our combined form.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The air inside the pyramid’s nexus was silent, heavy with the scent of ancient stone and the hum of a power that had waited eons to be released. Novak stood in the center of the hall, her presence a calm anchor in the rising tension as she waited for the final command to echo through the corridors. The silence was shattered not by a voice, but by a rhythmic, bone-deep pounding. The heavy metal seals we had just placed began to buckle, groaning under a strength that defied the laws of the world outside.

General Tor stepped through the wreckage of the door, his suit a charred testament to his actions, a ruin of slagged metal and scorched ceramic. He didn't look like a defeated man; he looked like a reinforced structure that had survived a catastrophic failure. "He is waiting," Tor grunted, his voice a gravelly rasp filled with grim determination.

In the final chamber, Rahu was a high-energy construct, a thermal core trapped within the stone. Tor charged with maximum kinetic force, his body manifesting a reinforced lithic shell. It was a clash of primeval forces. Tor's geological armor held for a moment, a defiant barrier against the storm, but Rahu's fire was an all-consuming tide. A blade of white heat carved through the stone, sending the General reeling against the wall in a shower of glowing dust.

Then, a soldier beside Novak stepped forward—a woman whose eyes showed optimal aetheric resonance. Lynn removed her helmet, her presence bringing a sudden, cool resonance to the burning room. Rahu stopped his advance, the needles of his flame flickering as they acknowledged an equal. They spoke then, their voices carrying the weight of a history that predated the stars. It was a dialogue of destiny, a debate on the necessity of the coming dawn. Rahu spoke of the flaw in the path, but Lynn's resolve was a beacon.

"Lem," she said, her voice inside my head. 

The merger was an explosion of life—the ancient power of Material Synthesis. I felt my spirit expand, my frame growing with a strength that was not my own and also entirely me. Thick, gnarled branches of Wood erupted from my body, fueled by the majestic flow of her Water resonance. We became a singular, towering force of nature—a forest standing against the sun.
