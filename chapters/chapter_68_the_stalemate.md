# Chapter 68: The False Stalemate

## Outline / Summary
- **The Debrief:** Lem returns to the White Forest ship and informs the crew of the Gorgons' rejection of the peace deal but acceptance of a stalemate.
- **The Transmission:** They send a long-wave transmission to Cradle Zero for Iris Novak, reporting the results and requesting the release of their captured comrade (Jarek).
- **The Release:** Iris provides coordinates outside the city. They recover Jarek from a disabled transport. He reveals he was interrogated about Lem, Rahu, and Maya but did not betray the resistance base location.
- **The Core's Betrayal:** While monitoring city transmissions, the crew picks up a new broadcast. The Core's "investigation" into the terrorists has concluded.
- **The Scapegoat:** The propaganda frames the "terrorists" not as coming from the White Forest, but as originating from Arlo's Northern Village. They are depicted as a "cultish" and secretive group.
- **The Realization:** The crew realizes the stalemate was a lie or that Iris has been overridden by a more aggressive faction within the Core.

## Character Development
- **Lem:** Distrust of the Core is validated; realization that the Core is not a unified entity.
- **Jarek:** Returns as a survivor, having resisted mental compromise.

## POV & Focus
- **POV:** Lem.
- **Focus:** The transition from diplomatic hope to the reality of the Core's propaganda machine.

## Timing
- Year 22 AT (Immediately following Chapter 67).

## World-Building Integration
- **Core Factions:** Overt evidence of the internal schism between diplomatic moderates (Iris) and the aggressive "Sanction" division.
- **Media Manipulation:** How the Core re-frames resistance efforts to target sovereign civilian populations (the North).

## Notes & Questions
- If Iris was sincere, she was gullible or overridden.
- The Core is targeting the North to justify "Plan B" (Scorched Earth).
