## Chapter Outline

1. **The Silence:** Immediate aftermath of the Great Fry; digital silence across the solar system; the Moon continues to fragment.
2. **Cradle Prime Activation:** Iris Novak and the surviving fleet reach the shielded interior of the Lunar Pyramid. The Core identifies this as their new sovereign territory.
3. **The Nomenclature Shift:** Archivist Command (rebranded Core) issues its first internal edict, designating the Lunar Pyramid as **Cradle Prime** and the abandoned Earth base as **Cradle Zero**.
4. **The Reclamation Mandate:** Novak views the "Controlled Burn" at Cradle Zero from orbit. Command realizes that while they have lost the planet, their technology is still following orders—turning their original base into a "Fire City."
5. **The First Mission Ordered:** The Chapter concludes with the formal order to reclaim Cradle Zero and extinguish the "Pillar of Fire" to convert it into a human-controlled outpost once more.
