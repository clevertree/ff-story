# Chapter 36: Parley

**Setting:** Arlo's Village / The outskirts of the five Northern Villages
**Timeline:** Year 1022 (Year 22 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Tactical Relocation:** Following their conviction to protect the North, Myrr’s crew relocates specialized modular mechanical trees from the White Forest to the outskirts of the five northern villages. These trees are moved and replanted to form a massive defensive perimeter around the valley.
2. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
3. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
4. **Defensive Germination:** Under the northern sun and supplemented by analog energy pulses from the resistance, the mechanical flora undergoes rapid growth, creating a dense "Wooden Shield" of bio-mechanical structures.
5. **The Ground and Air Phalanx:** Within days, the White Forest villagers use their mind-link technology to refashion the groves into ground-based defensive walkers and anti-air bio-mechanical turrets, preparing for a full ground and air defense of the villages.
6. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
7. **The Interrupted Sermon:** Arlo is delivering a sermon on the village platform in front of a great smoldering pire as a sleek, white Core diplomatic craft descends and lands near the village enterance.
8. TODO: Describe the ship/delegation.
9. **The Diplomatic Break:** Arlo pauses his speech. He descends from the platform and walks toward the landing zone as Cassia Vane and a group of "First Citizens" emerge.
10. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
11. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
12. **Reunion of the Outcasts:** Kiran is with Cassia on the diplomatic craft, standing behind her - someone Arlo has not seen in years since his departure for the Core internship.

## Synopsis
While Myrr’s crew rapidly constructs a massive ground and air defense system by relocating and respawning White Forest tree assets around the five northern villages, Arlo’s sermon is interrupted by the arrival of a Core diplomatic craft. Pausing his address, Arlo meets Cassia Vane—and Kiran, an old friend from the village who chose the Core—at the ramp of her ship for a final, private conversation about the impending threat.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The valley didn't look the same as it had a week ago. On the outskirts of the five villages, the horizon was now jagged with the silver-green leaves of the mechanical trees. Myrr’s team had moved them here in pieces, replanting them in a massive circle that hummed with analog energy. Under the pale northern sun, they had grown into a wall of wood and wire in just a few days. The villagers were already linked to them, twisting the branches into anti-air turrets and heavy walkers. We were ready for a fight, even if Arlo was still talking about peace.

Arlo was standing on the cedar platform in the village square, his voice steady as he spoke about the change of the seasons. Then the sound came—a low, clinical hum that vibrated in the soles of my boots. A white ship, sleek and polished, descended through the mist and landed right in the middle of our village, sending a spray of mud over the wooden walkways.

Arlo didn't look angry. He just stopped talking, mid-sentence, and waited. As the ramp lowered, he stepped down from the platform and walked toward the ship. I followed him as far as I dared. Out stepped Cassia Vane, looking like she hadn't slept in a thousand years, followed by a handful of "First Citizens" in their pristine gray tunics. Among them is Kiran, and Arlo greets his old friend first before addressing Cassia.

"I need to speak with you," Cassia whispered. She led him to the shadow of the ship's hull, away from the ambassadors.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The landscape of the North had been transformed by the urgent necessity of defense. In the span of a few days, the outskirts of the five villages had been fortified by the arrival of the White Forest’s modular trees. These mechanical sentinels, transported in dormant fragments and brought to life by the resistance’s analog pulses, had taken root with a terrifying speed. Through the mind-link, the villagers had refashioned the growing grove into a phalanx of ground-based walkers and towering anti-air batteries, weaving a "Wooden Shield" that bristled against the gray sky.

Beneath this canopy of living steel, the sky cracked with the arrival of the Core. A white ship, polished to a mirror sheen, descended like a cold star into the heart of the village. Arlo did not flinch. He stopped his sermon, the silence falling over the crowd like a heavy cloak, and walked toward the white metal. At the foot of the ramp, he met Cassia Vane, and behind her, the familiar face of Kiran. Arlo’s first words are for his former neighbor, acknowledging the years since his departure.

"I have come to speak of the end," Cassia said, her voice barely audible over the hum of the ship's engines. She drew him into the shadow of the craft, away from the eyes of the ambassadors.

Arlo listened with the patience of a mountain. He knew the terms before they were spoken. The Core had exhausted its patience; the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" was cracking, and they needed a final, bloody demonstration to seal the narrative.

### Lem
- **The Witness of Preparation:** Lem notes the efficiency of the White Forest's bio-mechanical logistics, comparing it to the slow, heavy industrialism of the Core.
- **The Bridge:** He observes the interaction between Arlo and Cassia, noting the visible decay of Cassia's loyalty to the system she serves.

### Myrr (Off-screen / Context)
- **The Architect of the Shield:** Myrr's influence is seen in the rapid deployment of the defensive grove.
