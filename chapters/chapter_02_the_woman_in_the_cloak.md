# Chapter 2: The Woman in the Cloak

**Setting:** Lem's home, occupied by military; Earth
**POV:** Lem
**Narrative Arc:** Introduction to Linn; first revelation of truth; forced compliance

---

Soldiers secure the area and escort Lem back into his house. With them is a woman wearing a cloak—clearly not a typical military officer. She carries herself like a scientist, yet everyone around her defers to her authority without question. Her name is Linn.

Linn requests a private conversation with Lem. She tells him they knew each other long ago, though Lem has no memory of her. There is no time for explanations, she says—only time for trust. She insists that Lem is essential to resolving the crisis, though she offers no justification that makes sense to him. The military complies with her wishes without hesitation, despite the strangeness of the situation and the unusual loyalty she seems to command.

Linn asks Lem to close his eyes and remain perfectly still. He tries, but an unsettling sensation rises from within him—foreign, invasive—and he instinctively pulls away. When he cannot comply a second time, Linn apologizes and strikes him, knocking him unconscious.
