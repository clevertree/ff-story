# Chapter 44: Siege

**Setting:** Northern Hive Periphery; The Desert Plain
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)

## Synopsis
Utilizing the mobile, hyper-growth properties of **Voidsmen** bio-mechanical trees, Myrr’s crew moves and constructs a massive "Tree Army" on the outskirts of Cradle Zero in a matter of days. Using analog mind-link technology, they refashion the rapidly growing grove into bio-mechanical assault units. Lem and Myrr lead this army in an offensive on the city, only to find themselves ensnared in a sophisticated false flag operation. The Core manually disables the city's power grid to frame the resistance as "terrorists" attacking civilian infrastructure. Despite using superior analog sensors to detect the internal Core signal that cut the power, the resistance is branded as mass murderers. Deceived by the public narrative, Myrr pushes the assault toward the desert base, leading to a massive engagement with Vector’s ground units and eventually General Ajax's flagship. Vector proves to be a formidable opponent, his mechanical precision allowing him to single-handedly stall the Tree Army's advance at the secondary gates.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Mobile Grove:** Myrr’s crew relocates specialized modular mechanical trees—the foundation of **Voidsmen** technology—from the White Forest to the desert outskirts of Cradle Zero. These trees are engineered for portability, capable of being moved and replanted in any environment with sufficient solar energy.
2. **Bio-Mechanical Germination:** Under the intense desert sun, the mechanical flora undergoes hyper-growth. Within days, the scattered trees expand into a dense, tactical grove on the edge of the Core's territory.
3. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
4. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
5. **The Mind-Link Refashioning:** Using analog mind-link technology, the **Voidsmen** refashion the living trees into heavy walkers, vehicles, and weaponry. The conversion from a silent grove to a military "Tree Army" is completed in a matter of days.
6. TODO: Clarify the passage of time and situational shifts in the setting.
7. **The First Strike:** Lem and Myrr lead the "Tree Army"—bio-mechanical assault units reinforced with **Voidsmen** machinery—in a massive offensive against Cradle Zero.
8. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
9. TODO: Detail the background activities of civilians or minor personnel during this transition.
10. **The Node Theory:** Myrr's team identifies the city nodes as purely control nodes. Their high-fidelity analog sensors confirm there are no significant power-generation signatures, despite the massive decoy cables the Core has installed to deceive digital scanners. They conclude that taking them out will sever the command link without harming civilian infrastructure.
11. **The Propaganda War:** As they breach the walls, the Core's media channels begin broadcasting a "Terrorist" narrative, portraying the resistance as mindless Gorgon monsters attacking vital civilian infrastructure.
12. **The Iron Pillar Detection:** During the siege planning, Voidsman sensors detect the **Iron Pillar** (the weaponized remnant of **Ark Prime**) lurking in the upper atmosphere. The resistance is rattled by the sight of the massive floating island, but they conclude it cannot fire into the melee without destroying the Core's own ground units. They believe their vehicles are fast enough to escape if the Pillar's scalar cannon were to fire.
13. **The False Flag Power-Cut:** As the first node is dismantled, the entire city’s power grid is suddenly disabled. The media immediately blames the "terrorists" for taking out the power stations.
14. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
15. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
16. **The Analog Revelation:** While the Hive citizens believe the lie, Myrr's team uses their analog sensors—which can process high-fidelity wave data beyond the Core's digital encryption—to detect the truth. They record the exact signal from the Core's central spire that manually tripped the power grid. They realize the nodes were never power plants; the Core disabled the grid on purpose to frame the resistance.
17. **The Public Accusation:** Despite the truth, the media footage of a "city planner" pleading for mercy convinces the public that the resistance knew they were taking out the power. Myrr's team realizes they have been branded as specialists in civilian suffering and that the people of the Hive will never see them as liberators, but only as "Terrorists."
18. **The Rising Resistance:** Myrr takes command of the chaos, arguing that if they are already labeled terrorists, they must achieve their objective by any means necessary. He orders a full assault directly on the Cradle Zero desert base.
19. **The General’s Entrance:** General Ajax’s flagship, the *Obsidian Sledge*, emerges from the thermal haze. Ajax broadcasts a single message: "To all Terrorists - surrender or be destroyed."
20. **The Tree Army Engagement:** The Tree Army engages in a large scale battle with the Core defences. It appears to have the upperhand as the **Voidsmen** crew are able to order it to rebuild itself when it's destroyed. The Core technology takes much longer to build.
21. **The Lead Interceptor:** As the Tree Army breaches the secondary gate, Vector appears in a sleek, reinforced Metal Vessel frame. He leads a counter-strike that is terrifyingly precise, targeting the exact harmonic junctions of the Tree Army's mind-link relay. His combat skill is so refined that he holds back an entire platoon of resistance walkers alone, demonstrating the Core's refusal to concede even a single yard of ground.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Mobilization of Voidsmen "Tree Army" completed at the Cradle Zero periphery. Specialized modular trees relocated from the North and subjected to hyper-growth protocols under 1,000 W/m² solar irradiance. Analog mind-link synchronization utilized to refashion biological-wood-mechanical hybrid structures into walkers, weapon-platforms, and tactical units. Conversion duration: 72.0 hours.

Kinetic offensive initiated by Unit Myrr. Target: Core control-nodes. High-fidelity analog sensors confirmed 0% power-generation signatures within target nodes, identifying them as decoy-command units. 

Core tactical response (Phase: Narrative Control): Remote-deactivation of the Cradle Zero power grid conducted via a central override signal from the Spire. Core media-channels initiated a "Terrorist" broadcast-cycle, attributing the Grid-failure to Voidsmen kinetic strikes. Narrative focus: civilian suffering and "terrorist" disruption of infrastructure.

Analog detection confirmed: Myrr's instruments recorded the specific Spire-override signal that manually tripped the grid. Technical conclusion: The Core executed a "False Flag" grid-shutdown to manipulate the public perception of the resistance.

Tactical engagement at the secondary gate: Subject encountered "Unit Vector" (Metal Vessel: Reinforced-Chassis). Vector demonstrated high-frequency precision targeting of the Tree Army's harmonic-junctions. Vector's motor-response latency is estimated at <5ms. Tactical evaluation: Vector is a high-tier single-unit obstacle to the Tree Army's advance.

General Ajax's flagship "Obsidian Sledge" detected on long-range scanners. Tactical state: Full offensive engagement between Voidsmen Tree Army and Core defense units. Regenerative biological protocols provide the Tree Army with a 3:1 replenishment-rate advantage over standard Core manufacturing.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The logistics of the **Voidsmen**'s mobile groves were a testament to the ancient beauty of Wood-Metal hybridity. In less than a week, a silent stretch of desert had been transformed into a bristling fortress. The mechanical trees, modular and hungry for the sun, were replanted and encouraged into a state of hyper-growth that no Core industrial facility could match. Through the analog mind-link, the **Voidsmen** spoke to the wood, refashioning branch and trunk into the devastating machinery of the Tree Army.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

The assault on Cradle Zero was a victory for the Core's propaganda before the first spear of wood even touched the wall. Myrr’s warriors struck at the enemy’s nodes, correctly identifying them as the pillars of their command network. But as the towers fell, the Core enacted a calculated betrayal: they manually severed the power to the entire city. In a heartbeat, the Hive’s media was flooded with images of the darkness we had "caused." A weeping puppet of the Hive begged for mercy on every screen, accusing us of knowing that these were vital power stations. 

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

Myrr watched the lights of the city go out, but his analog sensors told a different story. They captured the high-fidelity wave of a central Core override—a digital signal that bypassed all safety protocols to plunge the city into shadow. "They're killing the grid themselves, Lem," Myrr whispered, his voice like grinding stone. "Our instruments can see the fingerprint of the Spire's command. The nodes are empty shells, but the world will only see the darkness they blame on us."

### Lem
- **The Analyst of Defeat:** Lem observes the precision of the Core’s propaganda machine, noting that narrative control is more effective than physical armor.

### Myrr
- **The Moral Collapse:** He is devastated by the realization that their cause is being rewritten in real-time.
- **The Tactical Realist:** He accepts the "Terrorist" designation as an unavoidable consequence of the mission.
