**Estimated Length:** 3,500-4,500 words

---

## Chapter Outline

1. **The Assembly:** Quick assembly of grown machinery. Volunteers join from the outreach program, impressed by the White Forest technology.
2. **The Launch:** Desperate deployment to the moon. They navigate through fragments and lunar lightning, anticipated by the crew.
3. **The Deployment:** Lem and the crew land and mount speeders made of wood-water material. They speed toward the Pyramid on the largest remaining stable fragment.
4. **The Gauntlet:** Familiar plasma balls emerge from the mountains.
5. **The Shield:** Low-level autonomous flyers attract the plasma. The flyers are hit but remain undamaged, sparking a cynical remark about "unburnable trees."
6. **The Speculation:** Discussion on why Mission 1 failed—previous ships used fire-machine material vulnerable to the plasma weapon.

## Character Arc

**Lem's Emotional Journey:**
- Focus → Repetition of History → Pride in Resistance.
- **The Veteran:** Lem utilizes 100% of his knowledge from Mission 1 to protect his crew.

## World-Building Integration

✅ **Facts Applied:**
- The moon fragment remains largest because it is grounded by the Pyramid.
- Wood-water material absorbs and grounds electrical/plasma discharge better than military alloys.
- Outreach program volunteers provide the human element necessary for aetheric stability.
