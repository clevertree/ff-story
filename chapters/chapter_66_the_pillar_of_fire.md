# Chapter 66: The Pillar of Fire

## Outline / Summary
- **The Journey East:** Lem and his crew travel several hundred miles east toward the nearest equatorial Fire City.
- **The Obsidian Horizon:** They encounter a thick wall of black clouds and a long stretch of darkness before the central light of the Fire City becomes visible.
- **Atmospheric Barriers:** The humans remain in the ship due to the lack of oxygen and extreme heat near the city. They wish Lem luck as he prepares to exit.
- **The First Attempt:** Lem attempts to walk through the outer ring of fire. His system overloads, and he flares up like a match head, forced to retreat and heal.
- **The Wood-Water Solution:** Realizing he needs a better interface, Lem utilizes the "tree assets" (Wood + Water combo) to create a protective layer.
- **Passing the Threshold:** Lem successfully breaches the fire. The protective layer burns away, leaving only his resilient body as he enters the central spire.
- **The Watchful Spire:** Lem observes the massive architechture—a central flame pillar reaching into the sky, surrounded by a ring of exhaust fire. The Gorgons inside are immediately aware of his presence.

## Character Development
- **Lem:** Demonstrates tactical innovation by combining elements (Wood + Water) to overcome physical limits.
- **The Crew:** Showing total trust in Lem despite the high risks of the equatorial zones.

## POV & Focus

- Year 22 AT.

## World-Building Integration
- **Equatorial Fire Cities:** The most intense energy hubs on Earth, retaining solar-thermal efficiency.
- **Combo-Element Protection:** First demonstration of Lem using hybrid elemental material to shield against environmental extremes.

## Notes & Questions
