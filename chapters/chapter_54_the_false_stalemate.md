# Chapter 68: The False Stalemate

## Outline / Summary
- **The Debrief:** Lem returns to the White Forest ship and informs the crew of the Gorgons' rejection. He explains that the Gorgons distrust the Core for the same reason the northern villagers do: the refusal to be integrated into a system they know will consume them. He also shares the Gorgon's insight about human dependency—that the Core cannot actually free the machines without collapsing their own cities. Finally, he relays the Gorgon's cold advice on defending the North: to destroy any Gorgon that attacks it.
- **The Transmission:** They send a long-wave transmission to Cradle Zero for Iris Novak, reporting the results and requesting the release of their captured comrade (Jarek).
- **The Release:** Iris provides coordinates outside the city. They recover Jarek from a disabled transport. He reveals he was interrogated about Lem, Rahu, and Maya but did not betray the resistance base location.
- **The Core's Betrayal:** While monitoring city transmissions, the crew picks up a new broadcast. The Core's "investigation" into the terrorists has concluded.
- **The Scapegoat:** The propaganda frames the "terrorists" as originating from Arlo's Northern Village. Arlo is branded the "cult leader of the Maya Cult," and the village is accused of practicing "witchcraft" to disrupt Core systems.
- **The Reality & Irony:** Lem reflects on the lie. The village follows an indigenous religion with no witchcraft and feels no connection to Maya. The true irony is that the villagers view *digital technology itself* as the real witchcraft, believing ancient systems were built with "witch spells" (backdoors, remote access, identity theft) that destroyed the old world.
- **The Realization:** The crew realizes the stalemate was a lie or that Iris has been overridden by a more aggressive faction within the Core.

## Character Development
- **Lem:** Distrust of the Core is validated; realization that the Core is not a unified entity.
- **Jarek:** Returns as a survivor, having resisted mental compromise.

## POV & Focus
- **POV:** Lem.
- **Focus:** The transition from diplomatic hope to the reality of the Core's propaganda machine.

## Timing
- Year 22 AT (Immediately following Chapter 67).

## World-Building Integration
- **Core Factions:** Overt evidence of the internal schism between diplomatic moderates (Iris) and the aggressive "Sanction" division.
- **Media Manipulation:** How the Core re-frames resistance efforts to target sovereign civilian populations (the North).

## Notes & Questions
- If Iris was sincere, she was gullible or overridden.
- The Core is targeting the North to justify "Plan B" (Scorched Earth).
