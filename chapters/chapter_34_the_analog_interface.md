# Chapter 34: The Analog Interface

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** The White Forest - Analog Sanctuary

---

## Outline / Summary

Myrr proposes an interface. He needs to read the information Lem is storing to see if it's possible for his people to unlock—and ultimately dismantle—Synodic technology. Myrr assures Lem that within the White Forest, all digital signals are blocked; the Core cannot "listen in."

Lem agrees, feeling a sense of detached fate. Myrr dons an analog helmet and begins the procedure. Other villagers emerge from the trees, watching with bated breath—Lem realizes that had he refused, they might have killed him.

Lem enters a dream state. Within the digital architecture of his psyche, he finds Myrr's analog representation. Myrr is astonished: Lem possesses an "exact copy of actual records from the past," things that should have been erased by the Great Fry.

Myrr digs deeper, moving past the surface-level metadata and venturing too far into the core of Lem's aether-drive. He pulls up the raw, unencrypted record of the **Moon Cataclysm**.

The reaction is immediate and violent. The core of Lem's programming contains an embedded failsafe device—a routine designed by the Core specifically to prevent this information from being externalized. It acts like a mental IED. Since Myrr is fully linked at the time, the feedback is a direct, catastrophic mental attack.

From Lem's perspective, everything begins to happen on its own, without his intervention. The villagers and soldiers surrounding them in the clearing react instantly, raising their weapons as if to strike Lem, assuming he has just attacked their leader. But as Lem's body begins to hum and pulse with a lethal, erratic light, they realize the truth: he is about to detonate.

They lower their weapons in fear, backing away. A few brave individuals rush forward to pull and drag the unconscious, convulsing Myrr out of the clearing. Myrr survives, but the mental shock is so severe it will take him days to recover.

In the final seconds, Lem's physical shell—the Wood Vessel—lights up with blinding intensity. It explodes, shattering into a million pieces, "seeding" the clearing with his fragments.
