# Chapter 34: The Analog Interface

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** The White Forest - Analog Sanctuary

---

## Outline / Summary

Myrr proposes an interface. He needs to read the information Lem is storing to see if it's possible for his people to unlock—and ultimately dismantle—Synodic technology. Myrr assures Lem that within the White Forest, all digital signals are blocked; the Core cannot "listen in."

Lem agrees, feeling a sense of detached fate. Myrr dons an analog helmet and begins the procedure. Other villagers emerge from the trees, watching with bated breath—Lem realizes that had he refused, they might have killed him.

Lem enters a dream state. Within the digital architecture of his psyche, he finds Myrr's analog representation. Myrr is astonished: Lem possesses an "exact copy of actual records from the past," things that should have been erased by the Great Fry.

Myrr digs deeper, eventually pulling up the **Moon Cataclysm** record. The reaction is immediate and violent. The dreamscape turns red, and a deafening electronic noise obliterates all communication. Myrr is snapped out of the connection with a painful blow, collapsing to the ground. Lem's dreamscape goes dark. 

His physical shell—the Wood Vessel—lights up and explodes, shattering into millions of fragments.
