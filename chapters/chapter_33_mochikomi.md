# Chapter 33: Mochikomi

**Setting:** Cradle Zero; Briefing Chamber
**Timeline:** Year 1016 (Year 16 AT) (Project Ground Wire - The Ground Wire)
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem re-awakens in a specialized "Deep-Cold" frame in Cradle Zero immediately after his death in the High Enclave. He is greeted by Cassia Vane, but notices she has fundamentally changed—no longer the cheery, hopeful handler he knew, now focused solely on his survival. She reveals she had to fight Anton Drexler to save Lem from permanent decommissioning after his hesitation in **Ait-Aman**. This argument echoes a recent conflict with Anton over allowing Lem to continue missions rather than enter permanent stasis—the same argument Cassia had just made regarding Anton's insistence that Lem destroy the Gorgons.

Cassia begins her briefing on Mission **Mochikomi**, part of Project Ground Wire: the **Ground Wire**. She explains that the Metal Vessels have already been briefed, but they will not be entering the White Forest themselves. The **Voidsmen** represent a major threat in the region; they are capable of mastering mechanical forest technology to rival the Core's control over Synodic life. Although they have been mostly defensive and secretive, the Core is wary of their resistance to any ambassadorship and fears a potential Voidsmen Incursion. They do not take prisoners. Cassia notes that she didn't choose the project name **Mochikomi**, but she understands the systemic need to keep the White Forest "contained."

The **Voidsmen** inhabitants have developed a specific distrust of Metal Vessels, viewing them as the culmination of everything wrong with digital technology—complete obedience, remote control capability, and unlimited deadly force. All Metal Vessels sent into the White Forest have been destroyed. Unlike Lem, when Metal Vessels are destroyed, they do not retain their memory of death.

Cassia describes the White Forest in detail: it lies in the Silver Bight, an equatorial coastal sanctuary. The forest is a hybrid of real wood and water combined with artificial "synodic" wood and water machinery working in harmony. The trees are organized on a large spiraling grid, with certain areas containing very large and tall trees that penetrate the lower sky layer—a reaction to the loss of sunlight from Fire City smoke buildup. Throughout the forest, both near the ground and high in the trees, are embedded orbs. These orbs provide artificial sunlight energy for other plants when natural sun is blocked below the clouds. The orbs follow what was once known as the Moon cycle; although Earth's Moon is no longer capable of natural cycles, these orbs mimic the defunct cycle, providing a full moon once a month.

Cassia explains that the White Forest is protected by an unseen defense network, currently unknown and mysterious in nature. All soldiers sent into the forest so far have never returned, and no signals were sent back because the forest absorbs all transmission rather than merely blocking it.

Cassia then reveals the true reason Lem was chosen for this mission: his ability to retain memory. Unlike other Vessels, Lem will remember every moment of this mission—including, Cassia's tone implies, his own death if the mission fails. Lem understands from her subtle shift in demeanor that this is effectively a suicide mission, and he alone among Vessels will carry the conscious awareness of his own ending.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Cradle Reawakening:** Lem wakes in a specialized "Deep-Cold" frame in Cradle Zero. His memories of dying in the High Enclave are intact.
2. **The Changed Handler:** Cassia is there to greet him. Lem immediately notices she is different—no longer cheery and hopeful, but focused entirely on his survival.
3. **The Reprieve from Decommissioning:** Cassia explains that Anton wanted Lem in permanent stasis after his hesitation in **Ait-Aman**. She had to fight to save him.
4. **The Recent Argument:** Cassia reveals she recently had a bad argument with Anton to allow Lem to continue on missions rather than enter permanent stasis—the same argument she just made about not forcing Lem to destroy the Gorgons.
5. **The Final Ultimatum:** If Lem fails Mission **Mochikomi** (**The Ground Wire**), he will be permanently decommissioned. There will be no further chances.
6. **Mission Mochikomi:** Cassia briefed Lem on Mission **Mochikomi**. She notes she didn't choose the name, but understands the strategic need to keep the White Forest "contained."
7. **The Voidsmen Threat:** The Voidsmen are a major threat, mastering mechanical forest technology that rivals the Core's control over Synodic life. They are defensive and secretive, and their resistance to ambassadorship makes the Core fear a "Voidsmen Incursion." They do not take prisoners.
8. **White Forest Distrust of Metal Vessels:** The inhabitants view Metal Vessels with specific distrust, seeing them as the culmination of everything wrong with digital technology—complete obedience, remote control capability, and unlimited deadly force.
9. **All Metal Vessels Destroyed:** All Metal Vessels sent into the White Forest have been destroyed. When Metal Vessels are destroyed, they do not retain their memory of death. No signals were returned because the forest absorbs all transmission.
10. **White Forest Location:** The White Forest lies in the Silver Bight, an equatorial coastal sanctuary.
11. **Hybrid Forest Technology:** The forest is composed of a combination of real wood and water alongside artificial "synodic" wood and water machinery working in harmonious tandem.
12. **Spiraling Grid Organization:** The trees are organized on a large spiraling grid pattern.
13. **Sky-Piercing Trees:** Certain areas contain very large and tall trees that penetrate the lower sky layer, a reaction to the loss of sunlight from Fire City smoke buildup.
14. **Embedded Orbs - Artificial Sunlight:** Throughout the forest, both near the ground and high in the trees at various heights, are embedded orbs. These orbs provide artificial sunlight energy for other plants when natural sun is blocked below the clouds.
15. **Orbs and the Moon Cycle:** The orbs follow what was once known as the Earth's Moon cycle. Although Earth's Moon no longer cycles naturally, these orbs mimic the defunct cycle, providing a full moon once every month.
16. **Unseen Defense Network:** The White Forest is protected by an unseen defense network. Its nature and function remain unknown and mysterious.
17. **Lem's Selection Reason:** Cassia explains that Lem was chosen for this mission specifically because of his unique ability to retain memory.
18. **The Subtle Revelation:** Through her tone and word choice, Cassia conveys to Lem that this is a mission with nearly certain death. Unlike other Vessels, Lem will remember every moment of this mission, including—as Cassia's tone suggests—his own death.
19. **The Final Realization:** Lem understands from Cassia's demeanor shift that he is being sent on a mission where death is nearly certain, and unlike other Vessels, he will be able to remember his own death clearly.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

Consciousness re-established in a "Deep-Cold" frame at Cradle Zero following termination event in High Enclave. Initial sensory input indicates cold-start protocols and restoration of all memory archives including "death-event" data. Handler Cassia Vane observed performing limb-calibration on the obsidian-chassis.

Administrator Anton Drexler recommended permanent decommissioning following "Ait-Aman" mission failure, categorized as a "structural failure of sovereignty protocols." Handler Vane successfully contested the recommendation, citing high-integration metrics. 

Designation: Mission Mochikomi (The Ground Wire). Objective: Containment of the White Forest. Topographical data on the Silver Bight projected. Voidsmen populations identified as high-threat tier due to mastery of mechanical forest-architecture-integration. Tactical note: 0% prisoner retention rate among Voidsman forces.

Metal Vessel deployment restricted due to Voidsmen hostility toward remote-controlled units. Voidsmen ideology categorizes Metal Vessels as "dead-tech." Integrated Lunar Capacitors mimic pre-Invasion lunar cycles to facilitate photosynthesis beneath smog-coverage. Ambient sensor reading: 25 ppm ozone.

Acoustic and signal absorption detected; forest functions as a 100% data-sink. Mission parameters include high-probability termination. Memory retention protocols remain active for post-mission data recovery.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The transition was a silent, icy snap. I awoke in a frame of obsidian and shadow in Cradle Zero, designed for low-temperature operations in the frozen North. The "Deep-Cold" chassis was heavier, more deliberate, its internal hydraulics singing with the high-viscosity fluid required for sub-zero endurance. I expected the void—the cold storage of the decommissioned—but instead found Cassia waiting in the sterile light of the briefing chamber.

Her face was a mask of professional distance, the warmth I had once mistaken for friendship replaced by a sharp, lethal focus. She was the architect of my survival, but she looked as though the cost of that survival was starting to bleed her dry.

"I nearly lost you to the vaults," she said without greeting. "Anton Drexler wanted you in permanent stasis after the failure in **Ait-Aman**. He called your performance a 'catastrophic sovereignty breach.' He wanted you scrapped and indexed."

"And yet, I am here," I replied, my voice deep and resonant in the new frame.

"Because I had to fight for your right to exist," she said, her voice dropping to a whisper. "I argued that your 'Sovereign Refusal' was a sign of advanced integration, not failure. I told him that forcing a Wood Vessel to execute its own kin was a violation of the spiritual protocols he himself authorized. We had that argument in the original design phase; I had to win it again today in the field."

She activated the holographic display, and the **White Forest** materialized—a spiraling grid of biological and technological synthesis located in the **Silver Bight**. The forest was a miracle of "Synodic Harmony," where real wood intertwined with mercury-cooled machinery. Trees of impossible height, their trunks reinforced with geodesic tension cables, rose to pierce the lower sky layer, a reaction to the sun-choking smog of the Southern Fire Cities.

"This is Mission **Mochikomi**," Cassia briefed me, her voice low. "I didn't choose the project name, but the objective is clear: containment. The **Voidsmen** represent a major regional threat because they have mastered mechanical forest technology to a degree that rival our own mastery of Synodic life. They are defensive, insular, and have resisted every attempt at ambassadorship. Drexler cannot rule out a potential Voidsmen Incursion, and they are known for taking no prisoners."

She paused, highlighting the border. "The Metal Vessels have been restricted. The Voidsmen view them as the culmination of everything dead in the world—remote-controlled killers with no capacity for shame or memory. Every Metal soldier we have deployed has been dismantled silently. The forest doesn't jam our signals; it digests them. It absorbs the transmission and feeds it back into the root system."

I studied the spiraling grid. The organization was too precise to be natural, yet too fluid to be purely mechanical. The Lunar Capacitors—the glowing orbs embedded in the trees—followed a perfect 28-day cycle, mimicking the phases of a Moon that had long ago been shattered. They had rebuilt the celestial clock in the heart of the forest.

"You have been selected because of your memory," Cassia said, her tone shifting to a thin, razor-edged resignation. "Unlike the Metal Vessels, you retain the experience of physical termination. You carry the trauma forward. It makes you cautious. It makes you real."

She looked at me then, and for a fleeting second, the old Cassia peeked through the mask. There was a profound, tragic pity in her eyes. 

"This is Mission **Mochikomi**," she said. "The **Ground Wire**. You will deliver the message of the **Allocation**. But understand the stakes, Lem. If you fall, there will be no fourth awakening. And unlike any other soldier in the Hive, you will be fully conscious of the moment your light goes out. You will remember your own death, and that memory will be the last thing you ever own."

The realization settled into my obsidian frame. This wasn't a mission; it was a test of my utility against the probability of my extinction. I was being sent into a data-sink, and I was the only one who would have to live with the memory of the scream.
