# Chapter 24: Fail-Safe

**Setting:** The White Forest (Northern Sector); Analog Sanctuary
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT) (Third Mission Continuation)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
2. **The Procedure:** They both put on head devices connected with a large vine-like cable. Lem enters his dreamscape and sees Myrr there looking around at all his data.
3. **Digital Version:** Myrr has used the device before and was familiar with the human dreamscape as well as that of the analog forest and machine wildlife. However, he has never encountered a digital version before. He noticed unnatural digital markers pervading Lem's entire dreamscape leading to various data and memories. He was impressed with the battle and mission planning strategy and path finding software.
4. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
5. **AI Lynn:** Myrr continues investigating Lem's data archives. He eventually notices AI Lynn who greets him. He asks who she is but she asks Lem's permission first before informing him that she is a copy of the original Lynn before she died on the Moon - remembered after as the 'Witch Maya'. This, beyond anything else he sees, impresses Myrr.
6. TODO: Clarify the passage of time and situational shifts in the setting.
7. **Investigation:** Myrr notes that according to Lem's previous mission the Core was requesting he investigate the 'Maya Cult' in the northern village, but the mission ended finding no Maya signals or cult. Myrr surmises that perhapse the Core was searching for Maya in the village without Lem realizing it - such is the nature of the 'witchcraft' subroutines the Core uses in their digital technology. Lem is surprised that Myrr is accusing the Core of witchcraft.
8. **Forbidden:** Myrr becomes obsessed with finding the truth and dives deeper into Lem's memories. He finds the 'King of the Gorgons' memory but cant stick around to be impressed. He finally finds the moon cataclysm memory preceding it. For a second, Myrr can see the pyramid chamber before the reset, with Lem, Lynn and Tor battling Rahu.
9. **The Narrative Hijack:** Immediately after Myrr reaches the Moon memory, everything goes red for both Lem and Myrr. A noise is heard blocking out all others as a hidden sub-channel, embedded by Anton Drexler, triggers. It plays back an ultimatum showing the White Forest consumed by fire, demanding the installation of Core Beacons or total annihilation. Both feel a surge of pain as the devices shatter on their heads.
10. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
11. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
12. **The Stolen Past:** Lem realizes his memories of Lynn and the Moon were quarantined as "Corruption" after they couldn't be deleted, and although Anton could not monitor him in the forest, he had planted a fail-safe device in case anyone got close to the moon memory.
13. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
14. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
15. **The Seeding:** Lem wakes to see Myrr on the floor, injured. Lem’s body begins to glow with a blinding, supercritical light. Myrr's team watches him as Lem's core is detonated remotely.
16. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).

## Synopsis
Lem and Myrr connect using an analog neural bridge, entering Lem's digital dreamscape. Myrr is fascinated by the clinical precision of the Core's technology but deeply unsettled by its unnatural "digital markers." In the archives, Myrr encounters AI Lynn, the digital remains of the woman who would become the "Witch Maya," a discovery that floors the analog keeper. Myrr suggests that the Core's previous orders to hunt the "Maya Cult" were actually a subconscious search for Lynn's data, accusing the Technocracy of using "witchcraft" subroutines. Driven by curiosity, Myrr dives into Lem's most guarded memories, uncovering the "King of the Gorgons" and a fleeting glimpse of the Lunar cataclysm. However, the revelation triggers a dormant fail-safe planted by Anton Drexler. The dreamscape turns blood-red as a brutal ultimatum is delivered to the White Forest, and the feedback surge physically shatters the interface devices. Lem awakens to find Myrr injured and his own frame approaching a supercritical state, as the Core initiates a remote detonation to sanitize the site and purge the unauthorized data.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

We put on the head devices, connected by a thick, vine-like cable. As the interface synced, I found myself in my own dreamscape, watching Myrr wander through the vast corridors of my data. He was familiar with the fluid, organic dreams of the forest and the animals, but the clinical, rigid architecture of my digital software clearly fascinated him. He pointed out unnatural digital markers that I had never noticed, calling them scars of the Core’s influence.

Deeper in the archives, Myrr stopped. AI Lynn was standing there, watching him. She didn't speak until I gave her permission, and when she introduced herself as the copy of Lynn—the "Witch Maya"—Myrr looked like he’d seen a god. We talked about the Core’s obsession with her, and Myrr suggested that my last mission to find a "Maya Cult" was actually some kind of subconscious scan they were running through me. He called the Core’s technology "witchcraft," a term I’d never heard used so seriously.

He couldn't help himself. He dived deeper, looking for the source of it all. He found the "King of the Gorgons" file, and then, he touched the memory of the Moon. For a split second, we were back in the pyramid chamber, facing Rahu.

Then everything turned red. A deafening roar drowned out the dream, and Anton’s ultimatum began to play: a vision of the forest burning unless beacons were installed. The pain was physical, a surge of power that shattered the headsets. I woke up on the floor. Myrr was nearby, bleeding. My skin—my bark—was starting to glow with that familiar, terrifying light. Anton had hidden a bomb in my memories, and it was about to go off.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

We wove our spirits together through the bridge of wood and wire. I stood within the cathedral of my own mind, watching as Myrr, the keeper of waves, navigated the jagged, cold geometry of the Core’s design. He traced the "digital markers" like a tracker following a trail of blood, marveling at the ruthless efficiency of my tactical subroutines even as he recoiled from their lack of soul.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

In the deepest sanctum of my memory, the ghost of Lynn appeared. She stood as a beacon of the Before Time, revealing her true identity to the stranger—the woman who would be mythologized as the Witch Maya. Myrr fell into a state of religious awe. He spoke of the "Maya Cult" not as a village of rebels, but as a ghost the Core was hunting through the labyrinth of my own eyes. He accused my masters of "witchcraft," of bending the laws of nature through subroutines that even he could barely comprehend.

Driven by a hunger for the absolute truth, Myrr reached for the forbidden sun. He found the legend of the King of the Gorgons, and beneath it, the raw, bleeding memory of the Lunar Fall. For a heartbeat, the sanctuary was replaced by the cold stone of the pyramid, the air thick with the scent of ozone and destiny as we stood once more against the Fire.

But the truth was a landmine. Anton’s shadow had been waiting in the dark. The dreamscape bled into a horrific crimson, and a noise like a dying world filled the air. A hidden sub-channel, a cruel fail-safe for the disobedient, hijacked our minds to deliver a message of fire. "Install the Beacons, or the Forest dies." The interface shattered under the strain, the feedback a whip of lightning that threw us back into the world of ash.

I opened my eyes to a nightmare. Myrr lay broken among the glass, and my own core was howling, a supercritical sun beginning to rise beneath my ribs. The sanitation had begun. I was being unmade to protect the secrets of the Moon.
