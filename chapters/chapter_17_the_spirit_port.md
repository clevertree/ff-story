# Chapter 17: The Spirit Port

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem / Rahu (Observations)
**Setting:** Cradle Zero / The Fire City (Interior)

---

## Outline / Summary

Rahu is frustrated by his inability to force obedience from the Gorgons, specifically one individual who seems to stand out. He is on a mission to establish a remote transponder link to the Lunar Pyramid (**Cradle Prime**). After a brief search, Rahu finds the necessary aetheric node within the Fire City and secures a strong connection to the lunar base.

With his primary task complete, Rahu turns his attention back to the Gorgons. He notices one Gorgon—secretly **Lem**—staring at him. Since Gorgons never stare at anyone, this anomaly prompts Rahu to investigate. He enters the spiritual setting of Lem's psyche, using his authorized command rituals to look through Lem's memories.

Rahu is stunned by what he finds. He sees memories of the Gorgon helping its kind, which he interprets as "traitorous" behavior. However, as he digs deeper, he reaches the memories of the Moon Cataclysm. Rahu is confused; Lem's record doesn't match any military classification, yet he was clearly present as a significant figure. He sees the name "Lem" in the rituals and his processing banks translate it with nearly 100% certainty: Lem is **Mara**, the ultimate enemy he has been taught to hate and hunt.
