# Chapter 7: Crash

**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge (The Caucasian Eagle); Space (Approach to Moon)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 (continued approach; Cataclysm begins)

## Synopsis
General Ajax broadcasts a mission address to the fleet, framing the assault as a "defense of truth" against the traitorous "Prometheus." As the Moon reacts with massive spirals of blue plasma, *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density discharge. The bridge erupts into chaos as status lights flare and internal gravity fails, throwing the crew into a desperate spin. With its engines failing and the viewport dominated by the looming lunar surface, the ship begins its final, uncommanded descent toward a terminal impact.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Ajax's Broadcast:** General Ajax's voice fills the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*. He speaks from the flagship *Hermes*.
2. **The Speech:** Ajax uses the "Prometheus" narrative, repeating phrases from public news bulletins. He describes the mission as a defensive action against a human traitor and terrorist who sold Earth out to the invaders. He frames Rahu as a man rewarded with immortality for his betrayal. "But we're not going to let him keep that gift"
3. **Polar Activity:** Large spirals of blue plasma appear at the poles of the Moon. The ship's sensors record an increase in surface temperature.
4. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
5. TODO: Clarify the passage of time and situational shifts in the setting.
6. **The Pressure:** The spirals of blue plasma intensify and branch out reaching towards the fleet. 
7. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
8. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
9. **The Impact:** *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density plasma discharge. The hull emits a high-frequency scream of tearing metal. Red status lights activate across every console.
10. **Loss of Control:** The internal ship gravity fluctuates. Loose equipment and personnel are thrown against the bulkheads. The ship enters a spin.
11. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
12. **The Descent:** The bridge viewport fills with the grey surface of the Moon. The engines produce a rhythmic revving as it tries to restart but gives out and shuts down. The chapter ends as the ship crashes onto the lunar surface.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
General Ajax's voice occupies the bridge com-link. The broadcast originates from the flagship *Hermes*. He utilizes the "Prometheus" narrative, characterizing the mission as a defensive necessity against a human traitor who traded terrestrial security for biological immortality. The crew personnel demonstrate increased focus following the address.

Visual sensors record blue plasma spirals at the lunar poles. Atmospheric sensors indicate a significant increase in surface temperature and gravitational instability in local space. These anomalies suggest a reactive lunar environment.

*The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density plasma discharge. I record a high-frequency acoustic scream as the hull undergoes structural failure. All primary consoles activate red status indicators. The internal inertial dampeners fail, resulting in fluctuating gravity and unmanaged physical movement within the cabin.

The vessel enters a spin. Personnel are thrown against the bulkheads. I maintain data recording as the viewport is occupied by the grey lunar surface. The engines produce rhythmic revving before a total power-down. The mission reaches the terminal descent phase. I record the impact.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
General Ajax’s voice filled the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*, a heavy, anchoring presence broadcast from the flagship *Hermes*. He spoke of "Prometheus"—the name the news cycle had used to brand the man who had supposedly sold Earth to the stars in exchange for eternal life. "We’re not going to let him keep that gift," Ajax said, and I felt the air on the deck grow sharp with the crew’s shared resolve. They weren't just pilots anymore; they were hunters reclaiming a stolen legacy.

Through the viewport, the Moon began to wake. Massive spirals of cerulean plasma erupted from the lunar poles, twisting through the void like the auroras of a dying world. The ship’s hull began to vibrate, a low, metallic moan that felt like it was coming from the marrow of the ship itself. Gravitational distortions pulled at the stars, warping them into silver streaks as the grey surface below swelled to fill my entire vision.

Then the strike hit. It wasn't a sound, but a physical blow that shattered the peace of the bridge. A high-density plasma discharge tore into our side, and the hull emitted a high-frequency shriek of tearing metal. Red emergency lights washed over us, turning the smoke-filled air into a thick, choking haze. Internal gravity failed, and I felt myself lifted from the deck as the world tilted. Equipment and personnel were thrown against the bulkheads like leaves in a storm as the ship entered a sickening, head-over-heels spin.

The grey craters of the Moon rushed up to meet us, jagged and hungry. The engines gave one last, desperate rev, a rhythmic heartbeat that stuttered and then died, leaving us in a terrifying silence. I braced for the end as the silver landscape claimed the viewport, and the mission fell toward its terminal impact.
