# Chapter 7: Crash

**Setting:** Spacecraft bridge (The Caucasian Eagle); Space (Approach to Moon)
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day 0 (continued approach; Cataclysm begins)

## Synopsis
General Tor broadcasts a speech to the fleet, framing the mission as a "defense of truth" against a human traitor named "Prometheus"—a narrative masking the reality of Rahu and the Core's staging of the invasion. As blue plasma spirals erupt from the Moon's poles and gravitational distortions warp the space around the ship, *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density plasma discharge. The hull screams under the impact, causing total loss of control as status lights flare and internal gravity fluctuates wildly. Thrown through the cabin in a spin, the crew watches as the viewport fills with the grey lunar surface while the engines fail, marking the ship's final descent into the lunar atmosphere.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Tor's Broadcast:** General Tor's voice fills the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*. He speaks from the flagship *Hermes*.
2. **The Speech:** Tor uses the "Prometheus" narrative, repeating phrases from public news bulletins. He describes the mission as a defensive action against a human traitor who sold Earth’s secrets to the invaders. He frames Rahu as a man rewarded with immortality for his betrayal.
3. **Polar Activity:** Large spirals of blue plasma appear at the poles of the Moon. The ship's sensors record an increase in surface temperature.
4. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
5. TODO: Clarify the passage of time and situational shifts in the setting.
6. **The Pressure:** The lunar surface remains a solid, silent mirror of grey dust, but it begins to emit an intense gravitational distortion. The space around the ship seems to warp and pull.
7. TODO: Expand on the sensory impact of the environment (weather, ambient noise, lighting).
8. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
9. **The Impact:** *The Caucasian Eagle* is struck by a high-density plasma discharge. The hull emits a high-frequency scream of tearing metal. Red status lights activate across every console.
10. **Loss of Control:** The internal gravity fluctuates. Loose equipment and personnel are thrown against the bulkheads. The ship enters a spin.
11. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
12. **The Descent:** The bridge viewport fills with the grey surface of the Moon. The engines produce a rhythmic, failing sound. The chapter ends as the ship crashes onto the lunar surface.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

General Tor’s voice filled the bridge of *The Caucasian Eagle*, broadcasting from the flagship *Hermes*. He spoke about a duty to defend the truth and keep order, repeating phrases I had heard in public news bulletins. Tor used the "Prometheus" narrative, describing the mission as a defensive action against a human traitor who had sold Earth’s secrets to the invaders. The media had spent months branding Prometheus as a high-level official—a man who had been rewarded with immortality for his betrayal. I did not know then that Prometheus was actually Rahu, or that the story was a mask for the Core's role in staging the invasion. The government used this narrative to drive the final stages of the global military merger.

As we reached the Moon, large spirals of blue plasma appeared at the poles. The ship's sensors recorded a sharp increase in surface temperature. The lunar surface remained a silent mirror of grey dust, but it began to emit an intense gravitational distortion. The space around the ship seemed to warp and pull, making the maps and briefings we had inaccurate.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

We were struck by a high-density plasma discharge. *The Caucasian Eagle* emitted a high-frequency scream of tearing metal. Red status lights activated across every console. The internal gravity fluctuated wildly, and the control systems stopped working. Loose equipment and personnel were thrown against the bulkheads as the ship entered a spin.

I watched through the bridge viewport as it filled with the grey surface of the Moon. The engines produced a rhythmic, failing sound. We entered the lunar atmosphere, and the ground rushed up to meeting us.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

General Tor’s voice bled through the comms—a deep, resonant rumble that felt like the earth itself speaking from the flagship *Hermes*. He spoke of 'Prometheus,' the name the news had been repeating like a prayer for months. According to the legend they had crafted, Prometheus was a human traitor—a man who had stolen the keys to our world and handed them to the stars in exchange for eternal life. The crew tightened their grips on their consoles, their faces set with a hard, righteous fire. They weren't just soldiers; they were the guardians of humanity, here to reclaim the fire from a man who had sold our souls.

But the Moon had its own truth to tell. Great spirals of cerulean plasma erupted from the lunar poles, twisting through the black like the aurora of a dying god. The hull of *The Caucasian Eagle* began to vibrate at a frequency that felt like a scream in the base of my skull. Below us, the grey surface seemed to swell, a silver world that was suddenly awakening. The deck beneath my feet shuddered as the gravitational pull shifted, warping the stars in the viewport into long, silver streaks of light.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->

The impact was not just a sound; it was a physical blow that moved through the marrow of the ship. A high-density plasma discharge tore through our side, and the hull emitted a high-pitched metallic shriek—the final cry of a fallen giant. Red light washed over the bridge, thick and choking like blood. Gravity became a fickle ghost, throwing men against the bulkheads like leaves in a gale as the ship began to spin into a sickening roar.

Through the viewport, the grey surface rushed up to meet us, jagged and hungry. The engines gave one last, rhythmic cough of defiance, and then there was only the sound of the wind screaming across the hull as we plummeted into the shadows of the craters.
