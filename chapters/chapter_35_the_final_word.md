# Chapter 35: The Final Word

**Timeline:** Year 15 AT
**POV:** Lem
**Setting:** The Aether-Drive Dreamscape / Cradle Zero (Desert Base)

---

## Outline / Summary

Chapter 35 begins immediately after Lem’s physical detonation in the White Forest clearing. He finds himself in the dream state, staring through the translucent veil of his non-physical form at the scene of the explosion. The clearing remains rendered in great detail; he can see the villagers dragging the unconscious Myrr away and the soldiers lowering their weapons. To Lem, it feels as if he hasn't truly left, yet he is clearly detached from the physical world.

The familiar, enticing "bright path" leading back to the Cradle beckons him. For a moment, he hesitates. The recent failsafe trigger has left a bitter residue in his spirit; he knows now, more than ever, that the Core is dangerous and fundamentally untrustworthy. However, one thought rises above his fear: he needs to speak with Cassia. He is willing to risk capture by the Corps one more time to understand what really happened.

Lem moves toward the light. The reintegration process is unusually speedy. He awakens once again in the giant capsule deep within the Core’s desert base. To his surprise and worry, Cassia Vane is not there to greet him. Instead, he finds a man he has never seen before: **Anton Drexler**.

Anton greets Lem with a claim: "I believe that truth is always the best solution to everything." It is a cold, practiced pronouncement. Anton is brutally honest, explaining that Lem encountered a failsafe device designed to keep Vessels from going off-mission or self-destructing upon encountering "contaminated" data. He justifies the secrecy of the Moon Cataclysm by dismissed humanity's "childlike minds," claiming the human race was destined to blow itself up regardless—a concept they had already embraced in their own fiction and media long before the Core arrived.

Lem listens but refuses to engage in debate, a silence that clearly irritates Anton, who is used to absolute obedience. Anton changes tactics, attempting to appeal to Lem’s pride. He points out that thanks to Lem’s "impressive abilities" in Mission 2, much of the Dead Zone has been reclaimed and "Utopian Cities" have already been built and populated.

Lem cuts to the chase, mentioning his meeting with Myrr and the "other version of the truth" he was shown. This triggers a flicker of genuine anger in Anton. He sees Lem’s persistence—what he views as an idiotic vulnerability—as a sign of real resistance. 

Lem asks the biggest question: "Does the new world we're creating require the destruction of everything that was created before?" 

Anton hesitates for a second, then firmly replies: "Yes. History has proven it for thousands of years. The taint of the past will always spoil the virtues of the future."

The conversation ends there. Anton delivers his final word: Lem is to return to the White Forest, locate Myrr, and provide a message from the Core. Anton asks if Lem can do this in a way that feels defeated and patronizing, as if he has already decided Lem is useless. Before Lem can respond, Anton triggers an unseen magnetic pull, forcing Lem back into the capsule. An electrostatic stasis field engages—a level of paralysis Lem hasn't experienced since his first capture on the Moon. He falls into a deep, dark slumber as time begins to pass without reckoning.
