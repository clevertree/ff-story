# Chapter 24: The Siege of Cradle Zero

**Setting:** Northern Hive Periphery; The Desert Plain; *Iron Pillar* (Flagship)
**Timeline:** Year 1020 (Year 20 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The First Strike:** Lem and Myrr lead the planned "Tree Army"—bio-mechanical assault units reinforced with White Forest wood—in a massive offensive against Cradle Zero.
2. **Control Nodes:** Myrr's team speculates that the nodes are not power stations but control nodes. They rule out the potential of them being power stations by analyzing the grid the system uses, however there are large cables going from the node into various parts of the city. 
3. **The Propaganda War:** As they breach the walls, the Core's media channels begin broadcasting a "Terrorist" narrative, portraying the resistance as mindless Gorgon monsters attacking civilian infrastructure.
4. **The Node Trap:** The tree army enters a primary energy tower and dismantle it, only to realize it is a stage—a narrative trap designed to lure the resistance into a vulnerable position.
5. **Myrr’s Breakdown:** Myrr's team becomes disillusioned with the mission once again as they see a watch the media accuse a city planner for building 'power' nodes which would be succeptable to terrorist actions. The planner appeared to be a crisis actor pleading for mercy and claiming never thought anyone would attack the power stations.
They realize the people of the Hive will never see them as liberators, but only as the "Terrorists"
6. **The Rising Resistance:** Myrr takes command of the chaos, arguing that if they are already labeled terrorists, they must achieve their objective by any means necessary. He orders a full assault directly on the Cradle Zero desert base. 
7. **The General’s Entrance:** General Tor’s flagship, the *Iron Pillar*, emerges from the thermal haze. Tor broadcasts a single message: "To all Terrorists - surrender or be destroyed."
8. The Tree Army engages in a large scale battle with the Core defences. It appears to have the upperhand as the White Forest crew are able to order it to rebuild itself when it's destroyed. The Core technology takes much longer to build.
9. **The Shadow Defender:** However, the flagship of the Tree Army crewed by a white forest soldier crashes to the ground unexpectedly. It's engines explode leaving the hull of the ship stranded. Other ships suddenly explode as well.
The crew identifies Rahu who has deceptively entered the battle camouflaged with desert colors.  
10. **Rahu:** The Tree Army focuses on Rahu but to no avail. He is hard to see in the rising dust and his entire vehicle is camouflaged. He is too battle hardened for the white forest crew who themselves have never experienced a battle. 
11. **Retreat:** Rahu destroyes another flagship with a human white forest soldier in the cockpit and the ship crashes, except this time it explodes completely in a bright fireball. This is too much for the white forest crew and they evacuate the remaining personel from the battle while leaving their tree army behind to continue fighting. 
12. The battle turns in the Core's favor as the white forest crew are no longer in the battle to direct it. Rahu and the Core waste no time and burn the remaining tree army to ashes. 
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem and Myrr lead the White Forest's "Tree Army" in an assault on Cradle Zero, only to find themselves ensnared in a sophisticated propaganda trap. As they dismantle what they believe are critical infrastructure nodes, the Core broadcasts a narrative portraying them as mindless monsters and terrorists, using crisis actors to fuel the Hive's outrage. While the regenerative bio-mechanical units initially overwhelm Core defenses, the arrival of General Tor’s *Iron Pillar* and the intervention of Rahu—camouflaged and battle-hardened—turn the tide. After Rahu destroys several command vessels, the inexperienced White Forest crew panics and retreats, abandoning the Tree Army to be incinerated by Core forces.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
I stood next to Myrr on the command deck, watching the Tree Army tear through the perimeter. It looked like we were winning, but then the screens lit up. Every display in the city was showing us—not as soldiers, but as monsters. They had a guy on camera, some architect or something, crying about how we were destroying "peaceful" power stations. Myrr went pale. He realized right then that no matter what we did, the people inside would never see us as liberators. They’d only see the "Terrorists" the Core wanted them to see.

"If that’s what we are," Myrr whispered, his voice turning cold, "then let’s finish the job."

He ordered the push toward the desert base, but then the *Iron Pillar* dropped out of the haze. General Tor’s voice boomed over the comms, telling us to surrender. And then came Rahu. He was a ghost in the dust, camouflaged so well we couldn't even target him. One of our ships went down, then another. The White Forest crew wasn't ready for a real fight. They’d never been in a war before. When the second ship exploded in a massive fireball, they hit the panic button. We retreated, leaving the Tree Army behind to be burnt to ashes.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The siege of Cradle Zero was a masterpiece of narrative warfare. As the bio-mechanical Tree Army dismantled the primary energy towers, the Core’s media channels were already broadcasting the "Terrorist" update. We watched in silence as a crisis actor, playing the role of a devastated city planner, pleaded for mercy from the "Gorgon monsters." Myrr’s belief in a clean revolution died in that moment. He saw the cables leading from the nodes into the city—the nodes weren't power stations; they were control points for the collective psyche.

"They’ve already rewritten the history of this day," Myrr said, his eyes hardening. "If we are the villains, we should at least be effective ones."

The arrival of the *Iron Pillar* signaled the end of our tactical advantage. General Tor’s ultimatum was a mere formality; the real threat was the Shadow Defender. Rahu moved through the thermal haze like a predator, his desert camouflage rendering him nearly invisible to our sensors. He was a veteran of a thousand conflicts, and the White Forest crew, for all their idealism, were amateurs. When Rahu began incinerating our command vessels, the moral collapse was instantaneous. The crew ordered a full retreat, abandoning the Tree Army to the Core’s flamethrowers. We fled back into the North, defeated not just by fire, but by the Core’s control of the truth.
