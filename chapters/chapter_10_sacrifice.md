# Chapter 10: Sacrifice

**Setting:** Lunar surface (combat zone); Hermes command bridge; Lunar pyramid interior
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
As Rahu launches relentless plasma spheres from a mountain peak, pinning the human fleet behind a ridge, the flagship *Hermes* moves into the lower atmosphere to shield the units. In a massive thermal collision, thousands of spheres converge on the *Hermes*, vaporizing both the flagship and Rahu’s position in an incandescent bloom. 

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Bottleneck:** The human fleet is pinned behind a ridge. The comms are filled with overlapping reports of increased plasma fire. The Hermes and other ships attempt to fire on Rahu's position but the debris field prevents clear shots with plasma weapons or projectiles.
2. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
3. **The Tactical Zone:** The plain leading to the lunar base is an open surface with no geometric cover. From the mountain peak, Rahu launches a continuous stream of blue plasma spheres. The spheres arc down and strike any vehicle that moves onto the plain.
4. **CheckMate:** Suddenly a bright bloom of plasma shoots out from Rahu's position as he executes a massive strike against the ground forces. Exposed in their positions they know they cannot run away in time to avoid the plasma as the steep canyons offer no protection from above.
5. **The Transit of *Hermes*:** The flagship *Hermes* moves from its orbital position and enters the lower atmosphere crashing through the debris field and taking a lot of damage. It descends directly into the path of the plasma spheres which are magnetically attracted to the ship's hull.
6. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
7. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
8. **Rahu Destroyed:** Hermes has decended low enough that it can now fire on Rahu and all cannons fire in unison. Lem com shows a networked shot of Rahu close up being engulfed in light as he disintegrates along with the nearby weapon station he was using.
9. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
10. **The Collision:** Thousands of plasma spheres divert from the plain and converge on the *Hermes*. The ship’s hull glows blue before a large thermal discharge occurs. The peak of the mountain and the ship are obscured by light. When the smoke clears, neither Rahu nor the *Hermes* are visible.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)

The human fleet was pinned behind a ridge by intense plasma fire. Rahu stood on a mountain peak, launching a continuous stream of blue plasma spheres that struck any vehicle moving onto the open plain. The comms were filled with overlapping reports. The *Hermes* and other ships attempted to fire on Rahu’s position, but the debris field prevented clear shots.

My nerves were on edge. I could feel the static charge from the spheres building up in the air—a low-frequency vibration that made my teeth ache and the hair on my arms stand up. I felt like a bird trapped in a storm, unable to find a safe place to land.

Suddenly, a bright bloom of plasma erupted from Rahu's position as he executed a massive strike against the ground forces. This was "CheckMate." Exposed in their positions, the soldiers knew they could not run away in time to avoid the plasma, as the steep canyons offered no protection from above.

The sensory impact of the bombardment was a nightmare. The sky was filled with cerulean light, casting long, frantic shadows across the grey dust. Every impact sent a shockwave through the ground that I could feel even in the hovercraft. There was no sound in the vacuum, but the vibration in the hull was a bone-deep roar.

The flagship *Hermes* moved from its orbital position and entered the lower atmosphere, crashing through the debris field and taking heavy damage. It descended directly into the path of the plasma spheres, which were magnetically attracted to the ship's hull. This move cleared a corridor for us. The functional mechanics of the *Hermes* were failing—the shields were flickering, and the hull was glowing with a sickly blue light. As the *Hermes* descended low enough, it fired all of its cannons in unison. My cockpit monitor showed a grainy tactical shot of Rahu’s position being engulfed in light and disintegrating along with his weapon station.

I saw a group of soldiers in a nearby transport, their faces pressed against the glass. They weren't cheering; they were silent, watching their own flagship fall. "Ajax is going in," one of them whispered over the open channel.

Thousands of plasma spheres then diverted from the plain and converged on the *Hermes*. The ship’s hull glowed blue before a large thermal discharge occurred. The peak of the mountain and the ship were obscured by light. A snippet of found media echoed in my mind—a recruitment poster from the city: *The Grid is Your Shield. Trust the Command.* It felt like a cruel joke as the *Hermes* vanished. When the smoke cleared, neither Rahu nor the *Hermes* were visible.

A religious reflection from the villagers back home came to me: *The sun does not set, it only waits for the dawn.* But here, on the moon, there was no dawn. Only the cold, silent truth of extraction. I watched as the local "flora"—the crystalline growths near the ridge—shattered from the thermal shock, their fragments scattering like glass in the dark.

The plain before the central pyramid was a killing floor of open dust. On a spire of jagged rock above the target, a silhouette of molten light—the one the news had named 'Prometheus'—orchestrated the defense. He didn't just fire; he commanded the heavens themselves. Blue spheres of plasma arched downward in a continuous, graceful rain, each one seeking out the metal heart of a hovercraft. We were pinned, our vehicles groaning as the static charge from the Moon's ancient defenses filled the air with a hum that set my teeth on edge. This was the trial—the sky itself rejecting our presence.

The second trial was the terror that threatened to consume the men. Over the comms, I heard the breaking of spirits—voices that had been disciplined for years fighting back waves of raw, jagged panic as they looked upon the impossible reality of the Moon. Suddenly, a blinding bloom of plasma erupted from the peak—a move the tactical monitors labeled "CheckMate." The sky became a ceiling of fire, trapping the fleet in the canyons with no path of retreat.

The choice of the *Hermes* was not a calculation of numbers, but of souls. General Ajax brought the flagship down, a silver mountain descending into the lower atmosphere with a roar that transcended the vacuum. It was the physical manifestation of Earth’s resolve, a shield made of titanium and human courage. Thousands of plasma spheres, drawn by the ship’s massive presence, converged on the hull in a blue-white frenzy. The *Hermes* didn't just fall; it offered itself.

As the flagship cleared the sky, its final volley was a chorus of fire. I watched through the cockpit viewports as the mountain peak was consumed by the ship's cannons. Rahu—or the thing that looked like him—was lost in the incandescent bloom, the ancient weapon station disintegrating into the grey dust. The collision was a thermal discharge that bleached the world, leaving a silence that was more terrifying than the noise of the battle.

Then the sky darkened, but it wasn't a cloud. The *Hermes* moved into the lower atmosphere, a massive, silver shield of steel. It was a heroic, sacrificial weight. Thousands of plasma spheres diverted from the ground units, swarming toward the flagship like moths to a flame. But the *Hermes* wasn't finished. As it descended, every cannon on the ship fired in a single, coordinated burst. On my HUD, a networked feed showed the mountain peak—and the figure upon it—being engulfed in a brilliant white light. Rahu disintegrated along with the spire.
