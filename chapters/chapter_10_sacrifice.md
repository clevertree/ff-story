# Chapter 10: Sacrifice

**Setting:** Lunar surface (combat zone); Hermes command bridge; Lunar pyramid interior
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
As Rahu launches relentless plasma spheres from a mountain peak, pinning the human fleet behind a ridge, the flagship *Hermes* moves into the lower atmosphere to shield the units. In a massive thermal collision, thousands of spheres converge on the *Hermes*, vaporizing both the flagship and Rahu’s position in an incandescent bloom. 

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Bottleneck:** The human fleet is pinned behind a ridge. The comms are filled with overlapping reports of increased plasma fire. The Hermes and other ships attempt to fire on Rahu's position but the debris field prevents clear shots with plasma weapons or projectiles.
2. TODO: Incorporate a religious or philosophical reflection from a local perspective.
3. **The Tactical Zone:** The plain leading to the lunar base is an open surface with no geometric cover. From the mountain peak, Rahu launches a continuous stream of blue plasma spheres. The spheres arc down and strike any vehicle that moves onto the plain.
4. **CheckMate:** Suddenly a bright bloom of plasma shoots out from Rahu's position as he executes a massive strike against the ground forces. Exposed in their positions they know they cannot run away in time to avoid the plasma as the steep canyons offer no protection from above.
5. **The Transit of *Hermes*:** The flagship *Hermes* moves from its orbital position and enters the lower atmosphere crashing through the debris field and taking a lot of damage. It descends directly into the path of the plasma spheres which are magnetically attracted to the ship's hull.
6. TODO: Add technical exposition explaining the functional mechanics of the technology or structures involved.
7. TODO: Describe the adaptive behaviors of local flora and fauna.
8. **Rahu Destroyed:** Hermes has decended low enough that it can now fire on Rahu and all cannons fire in unison. Lem com shows a networked shot of Rahu close up being engulfed in light as he disintegrates along with the nearby weapon station he was using.
9. TODO: Integrate a snippet of found media or Core propaganda playing nearby.
10. **The Collision:** Thousands of plasma spheres divert from the plain and converge on the *Hermes*. The ship’s hull glows blue before a large thermal discharge occurs. The peak of the mountain and the ship are obscured by light. When the smoke clears, neither Rahu nor the *Hermes* are visible.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Human ground units were confined behind a geological ridge due to high-persistence plasma fire. The Wood Vessel (Rahu) was positioned on a mountain peak, maintaining a continuous discharge of blue plasma spheres. These spheres effectively neutralized any unit attempting to cross the open plain. Communication channels recorded a high volume of overlapping tactical reports. The flagship *Hermes* and accompanying vessels were unable to achieve a clear target-lock on Rahu’s position due to atmospheric debris.

Localized static-charge increased due to continuous plasma bombardment. Onboard sensors and personal equipment recorded high-frequency vibrations. I experienced significant bio-feedback from the external environmental ionization.

A high-intensity plasma bloom originated from the mountain peak. This tactical maneuver, designated as "CheckMate," utilized wide-area saturation. Human ground units in the canyon sectors were vulnerable to the vertical trajectory of the spheres, as the localized terrain provided zero cover against overhead strikes.

Luminescence in the cerulean spectrum dominated the local environment. Impacts resulted in significant seismic shockwaves. My hovercraft’s hull recorded continuous mechanical vibration in the absence of a transmission medium for sound.

The *Hermes* initiated an orbital descent into the lower atmosphere. The vessel suffered multiple kinetic impacts from the debris field. It oriented its path to intercept the plasma spheres. Magnetic attraction between the spheres and the ship’s hull resulted in a localized diversion of the projectiles, clearing a tactical corridor for ground units. The *Hermes*’ structural integrity declined under the thermal load. The flagship deployed its full battery of cannons at low altitude. Tactical monitors recorded the total destruction of Rahu’s position and the neutralizing of his weapon station.

Personnel in neighboring transport vehicles observed the descent of the flagship. Communication channels recorded a confirm of General Ajax’s final engagement protocol.

A high volume of plasma spheres redirected from ground targets to the *Hermes*. The flagship's hull suffered a total thermal discharge. Visual data from the mountain peak was obscured by high-intensity light. The *Hermes* was subsequently removed from the tactical grid. Post-event analysis indicated that both the flagship and the mountain peak were non-visible following the discharge.

Localized crystalline formations near the ridge suffered structural failure due to thermal shock. The debris was distributed across the sector. Mission objectives shifted from combat to post-impact extraction protocols.

The plain before the central pyramid was a killing floor of open dust. On a spire of jagged rock above the target, a silhouette of molten light—the one the news had named 'Prometheus'—orchestrated the defense. He didn't just fire; he commanded the heavens themselves. Blue spheres of plasma arched downward in a continuous, graceful rain, each one seeking out the metal heart of a hovercraft. We were pinned, our vehicles groaning as the static charge from the Moon's ancient defenses filled the air with a hum that set my teeth on edge. This was the trial—the sky itself rejecting our presence.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

The second trial was the terror that threatened to consume the men. Over the comms, I heard the breaking of spirits—voices that had been disciplined for years fighting back waves of raw, jagged panic as they looked upon the impossible reality of the Moon. Suddenly, a blinding bloom of plasma erupted from the peak—a move the tactical monitors labeled "CheckMate." The sky became a ceiling of fire, trapping the fleet in the canyons with no path of retreat.

The choice of the *Hermes* was not a calculation of numbers, but of souls. General Ajax brought the flagship down, a silver mountain descending into the lower atmosphere with a roar that transcended the vacuum. It was the physical manifestation of Earth’s resolve, a shield made of titanium and human courage. Thousands of plasma spheres, drawn by the ship’s massive presence, converged on the hull in a blue-white frenzy. The *Hermes* didn't just fall; it offered itself.

As the flagship cleared the sky, its final volley was a chorus of fire. I watched through the cockpit viewports as the mountain peak was consumed by the ship's cannons. Rahu—or the thing that looked like him—was lost in the incandescent bloom, the ancient weapon station disintegrating into the grey dust. The collision was a thermal discharge that bleached the world, leaving a silence that was more terrifying than the noise of the battle.

Then the sky darkened, but it wasn't a cloud. The *Hermes* moved into the lower atmosphere, a massive, silver shield of steel. It was a heroic, sacrificial weight. Thousands of plasma spheres diverted from the ground units, swarming toward the flagship like moths to a flame. But the *Hermes* wasn't finished. As it descended, every cannon on the ship fired in a single, coordinated burst. On my HUD, a networked feed showed the mountain peak—and the figure upon it—being engulfed in a brilliant white light. Rahu disintegrated along with the spire.
