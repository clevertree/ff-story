# Chapter 79: The Fall of the General

The desert base was no longer a sanctuary of order. It had become a fortress of desperation. Around the primary entrances, a multitude of soldiers stood in practiced, defensive postures, their high-yield rifles and pulse-cannons pointed outward toward the shimmering heat of the horizon. They were backed by banks of Core technology—tripod sentries and automated turrets that hummed with a low, menacing vibration.

On the outskirts, at the White Forest encampment, Lem stood beside the radio operator who had stayed behind to monitor the aetheric frequencies. The air inside the small command tent was thick with the smell of scorched ozone and recycled air. 

"Look at this," the operator said, his voice trembling as he adjusted the frequency on a flickering video monitor. 

The news broadcast was chaotic. The Archivist media machine, usually so polished and controlled, was showing raw, unedited footage from surveillance drones. The announcer’s voice was high-pitched, bordering on panic. 

"Reports are coming in of multiple sightings," the voice crackled. "The witch Maya... she is appearing on one—no, several of the speeder bikes. We are seeing identical signatures in multiple sectors."

The screen flickered, showing a long-range shot of the desert floor. A fleet of bikes, silver and jagged, was cutting across the sand. On each one sat a dark, cloaked figure—a ghostly apparition of Maya. They moved with a synchronized, fluid grace that defied standard physics.

"They've punched through the outer perimeter," the operator whispered.

The camera zoomed in on the main entrance of the desert base. At the very center of the gate stood a massive figure. It was General Tor. He held a colossal gun, a weapon designed for heavy Synodic suppression, and he looked like a statue of iron against the shifting sands. He faced the oncoming swarm alone, the ultimate symbol of the Core’s unyielding resolve.

The perspective shifted to Tor’s helmet-cam. The fleet of bikes surged forward, a wave of dark steel and phantom energy. 

Then, the firing began.

Tor didn't flinch. He unleashed a continuous stream of white-hot plasma, tearing through the lead bikes. The explosions were spectacular, sending plumes of black smoke and silver fragments into the air. But for every bike he destroyed, the others seemed to gain ground, weaving through the debris with impossible speed.

Suddenly, one bike separated from the pack. It was moving at a crazy rate, avoiding the crossfire by inches, using the other apparitions as a literal shield. The camera caught a close-up: the dark apparition of Maya was hunched over the handlebars, her form appearing to disintegrate in real-time, flakes of dark matter peeling off her body and the speeder itself like ash in a gale.

"She's too close!" the operator yelled.

Every defensive measure at the gate fired simultaneously. A wall of fire and kinetic energy slammed into the bike’s position. The speeder disintegrated in a blinding flash, but from within the explosion, a dark shape launched upward. 

It was Maya. She flew through the air in a precise, predatory motion, clearing the defensive line and the soldiers. She landed directly in front of Tor.

Before the General could swing his massive weapon, Maya struck. She held a long, recently refashioned metal sword that shimmered with a cold, blue light. She drove the blade clean through Tor’s chest.

The General’s body didn't bleed. It buckled. The iron resolve vanished as his form began to fray at the edges. With a sound like grinding stone, General Tor—the Earth Vessel, the Architect of Order—fell to the ground and disintegrated into a pile of grey ash.

The screen went to static.

"No," Lem whispered. "We have to move."

He didn't wait for a response. He ran to the White Forest clusters—the ships that belonged to the Palad crew—and signaled for an immediate launch. Within minutes, they were screaming across the desert.

When they arrived, the entrance to the base was a graveyard of smoldering metal. The defensive turrets were silent, reduced to twisted piles of slag. Lem jumped from the ship before it had even fully settled, running into the dark maw of the entrance. 

The interior of the base was a path of destruction. Walls were scorched, and the floor was littered with the remains of Core technology. But there was no sign of the soldiers, the Archivists, or Maya. 

Then, he heard it. A deep, resonant boom that shook the very foundations of the base. It was coming from the large central chamber.

Lem ran toward the sound, reaching the observation gallery. Below him, in the massive hall, an epic battle was unfolding.

Rahu was there, his fire-nature fully unleashed. He was fighting a dozen apparitions of Maya at once. Every time he struck one down with his flaming sword, another would reappear from the shadows, rushing at him with a silent, ferocious anger. Rahu was a titan of flame, his movements a blur of heat and steel, but he was being pushed back.

Behind a reinforced, sealed window at the far end of the chamber, Lem saw them—the remaining core crew of the desert base. They were huddled together, watching in terror as their protector fought to keep the phantoms at bay. Rahu was the only thing standing between them and the witch.

The rate of spawning began to accelerate. The apparitions were no longer just striking; they were swarming. Rahu’s flames began to flicker, his Spirit-ports straining under the constant assault. One apparition ducked under his guard, and another struck his arm. 

He stumbled. In that moment of weakness, one of the phantoms snatched the flaming sword from his hand.

She raised the weapon high. Rahu looked up, his eyes wide with a final, flickering realization. The sword came down.

Rahu didn't just die; he exploded. A shockwave of pure thermal energy blasted outward, shattering the remaining apparitions and throwing Lem back against the gallery wall.

When the smoke cleared, only one Maya remained. She stood in the center of the room, holding the handle of the now-extinguished sword. She stared at the window where the humans were hidden, her cloak tattered and her form still shedding dark flakes. 

She looked at them for a long moment, a silent judge of the world they had tried to build. Then, she dropped the hilt.

Her body, like the sword and the General before her, began to disintegrate. She vanished into a cloud of dark dust that settled slowly over the ruins of the chamber.

The room was quiet. The battle was over. The base was empty, save for the echoes of the fall and the humans staring out at the silence.
