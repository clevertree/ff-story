# Chapter 18: Entry

**Setting:** Frozen North; Arlo's Village
**Timeline:** Year 1015 (Year 15 AT)
**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Environmental Shift:** Transition from the smog of the Hive to the white, frozen wilderness with a clearer sky.
2. **The Village Entry:** Lem and his squad of Metal Vessels enter the settlement. He notes the lack of energy signatures. The villagers tolerate their presence but remain distant and unwelcoming.
3. **Arlo's Introduction:** Meeting a boy who wants to use technology but isn't allowed. He is offered a chance by Lem's crew to take an internship at a Core education facility and make his tech dreams come to life. He is deeply attracted to the offer, but hesitant.
4. **The Temporal Disparity:** After managing first contact through Arlo, Lem asks what the villagers know about Maya. Arlo mentions that he remembers elders naming Maya as one of the central figures in the Moon Cataclysm that they remember happening only decades ago.
5. **The Scoff of the Hive:** Lem notes one of the Core Metal Vessel soldiers scoffs after hearing this. He realizes Arlo and the villagers are accustomed to being mocked by Core citizens for their "wacky theory" that the Cataclysm was a recent event.
6. **The Cult Inquiry:** Lem decides not to pursue the debate and asks instead if there has been any sign of Maya, or Maya worshippers, or cult activity.
7. **The Religion of Stories:** Arlo is confused by the search for a "cult." He explains his elders' religion is just oral history—a way of remembering the past through stories rather than ritual. He laments that without technology, their history is limited by the unreliability of human memory.
**POV:** Lem

## Synopsis
Lem leads his squad into the heart of the Northern settlement, a place defined by its analog silence and refusal of Hive technology. Here, he meets Arlo, a young man torn between the traditions of his people and a desperate curiosity for the mechanical world Lem represents. As the Core offers Arlo a prestigious path to the Hive, the tension between the villagers' stoicism and the Core's invasive presence begins to boil. During their exchange, Arlo reveals the villagers' belief that the Moon Cataclysm occurred only decades ago, a claim that draws mockery from the Core soldiers. Lem investigates the possibility of a "Maya Cult," only to find that the villagers' "religion" is nothing more than oral history. Arlo expresses a bittersweet desire for technology to preserve these fading memories, highlighting the personal cost of the village's isolation.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
We entered the village, which was defined by analog silence. They used the lack of energy signatures as a shield. I met a boy named Arlo. He looked at my mechanical frame with a hunger for technology. My crew offered him a way out—an internship at a high-level Core facility. He looked like he wanted to say yes, but he was holding back, looking at the elders in the shadows.

I asked Arlo what his people knew about Maya. He looked at me and said the elders talked about her all the time. They called her a central figure in the Moon Cataclysm—which they insisted happened only fifteen or twenty years ago. One of the Metal soldiers next to me let out a short, sharp laugh. Arlo didn't even flinch. I could tell he was used to being treated like he was crazy for believing his own family's history. I didn't want to start an argument about dates, so I just asked if there were any cults or Maya worshippers around here. Arlo looked confused. He told me he didn't even know what a cult was. He said his people just had "story time" where they told tales of the old world. He sounded a bit sad when he mentioned it, complaining that if they just had a little bit of tech, they wouldn't have to worry about people forgetting the details. He hated that their entire history was limited to what a few people could remember.

## Draft (13_PLUS)
The village was a sanctuary of stillness, a refuge from the hum of the machine. I led my squad of Metal Vessels into the center, our iron boots leaving heavy, dark wounds in the pristine snow. I found Arlo in the shadows, a youth with a dreamer’s eyes who looked at my mechanical joints with a desperation I recognized. My unit extended the Core’s invitation: a scholarship to the great libraries of the Hive, a life of technical majesty. For a heartbeat, I saw his spirit waver toward the light.

"What do your elders say of the one called Maya?" I asked, my voice synthesized and low. 

Arlo’s gaze didn't waver. "They say she was the heart of the fire," he replied. "The one who broke the Moon a dozen winters ago. They remember the sky falling as if it were yesterday."

Behind me, a Metal Vessel emitted a burst of static that sounded suspiciously like a sneer. I saw the muscles in Arlo’s jaw tighten. He was familiar with the arrogance of the Hive, the way they looked down on the 'primitive' villagers for their rejection of the Thousand-Year history. I steered the conversation away from the fallacy and asked about signatures of worship—ritual sites or secret gatherings dedicated to her name.

The boy tilted his head, genuinely perplexed. "A cult? We have no such thing. My people have stories, yes. We sit in the long nights and piece together the fragments of who we were. But it is just memory, Lem. Unreliable, fading human memory." He looked down at his own hands, his voice tinged with a sudden bitterness. "If we had the tools you carry, the stories wouldn't change with every telling. We wouldn't be limited by the frailty of what a single mind can hold."
