# Chapter 70: The Narrative Trap

**Objective:** The Core uses media to vilify the defenders; Cassia Vane becomes a turncoat.

**Key Events:**
- Defenses are completed in hours; the crew waits for the assault.
- Villagers remain grateful but wary, keeping the "digital witchcraft" (Vessels/machines) at the edge of the village.
- Cassia Vane appears, having abandoned her tech and status; she is cynical and disillusioned after seeing the Core's leadership.
- Arlo advises Cassia to detach from the conflict for her own benefit.
- The Core delays the attack to frame the narrative:
    - Lists White Forest members as "terrorists."
    - Claims they turned off city power and caused "civilian casualties."
    - Depicts the defense as "Gorgon-handler" aggression.
    - Offers "forgiveness" to the humans if they surrender their handlers—a tactic to cause friction in Lem's crew.
