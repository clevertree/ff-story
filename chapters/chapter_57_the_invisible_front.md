## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Defensive Deployment:** As the infiltration fleet (Chapter 56) approaches Cradle Zero, they encounter the first organized terrestrial defense. A fleet of fast-moving ships, striders, and monoliths stands between them and the base.
2.  **The Eager Resistance:** The "Crew" (White Forest inhabitants) are not intimidated. They perceive the Core's terrestrial soldiers as weak and poorly trained compared to their own clandestine background. They believe their 25% assault fleet is more than enough to crush this inferior defense.
3.  **Engagement:** A massive battle erupts in the dunes. The Tree Army's superior firepower and automated precision begin devouring the Core's formations. Several Core ships are vaporized in the opening minutes.
4.  **The Fortification Barrier:** A subset of the automated monoliths reaches the base's perimeter and begins hammering at the energy barriers. It is a slow, grueling process, but the outcome seems inevitable.
5.  **The First Explosion:** Without warning, one of the Crew's flagships—manned by a White Forest human—explodes from the side. There is no visible projectile, no heat signature, and no incoming signal.
6.  **The Phantom Strike:** Seconds later, the ship is completely consumed in a secondary explosion. The Crew's communications net descends into chaos as they realize they cannot see the attacker.
7.  **The Crew's Retreat:** As more flagships go down, the remaining human pilots pull their vehicles out of the immediate front line, allowing the automated drones to continue the fight. This decision shifts the tactical advantage; without human intuition on the field, the automated fleet is left vulnerable.
8.  **The Total Route:** The invisible foe dismantles the remaining Tree Army fleet with clinical efficiency. The advance on the Node-side main battle (Chapter 55) is also disrupted.
9.  **The Order to Withdraw:** Realizing they are fighting a ghost in the dust and chaos, Myrr orders the remaining forces to break engagement and return to their forest outpost. 

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Obarchive of Hubris:** Lem realizes that the Crew's eagerness for battle led them to underestimate the Core's hidden depth. 
-   **The Recognition of the Unknown:** He monitors the sensor logs, searching for the anomaly that destroyed the fleet.

### Myrr
-   **The Tactician's Failure:** Myrr is forced to reckon with the limit of "Plan C." His confidence in the Crew's superior training has been shattered by an invisible enemy.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Cradle Zero Defenses:** Establishing that the terrestrial base is protected not just by numbers, but by specialized elite units.
-   **Automated Vulnerability:** Why "unmanned" fleets fail when faced with high-tier unconventional warfare.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The explosions should feel sudden and terrifying—no warning, just a catastrophic failure of the ship's core.
-   Describe the dust and sand of the desert battle as a medium that the enemy is using to hide.
-   The transition from "victory" to "route" should happen in a matter of minutes.
