---

## Chapter Outline

1.  **The Defensive Deployment:** As the infiltration fleet (Chapter 56) approaches Cradle Zero, they encounter the first organized terrestrial defense. The **Iron Pillar** hangs in the low atmosphere, and General Tor oversees a deployment of camouflaged assets.
2.  **The Eager Resistance:** The "Crew" (White Forest inhabitants) are not intimidated by the visible ships. They believe their 25% assault fleet is more than enough to crush the Core's inferior defense.
3.  **The Phantom Defender:** A camouflaged **Rahu** enters the fray. He moves through the battlefield as a ghost of thermal distortion, dismantling ships from within the dust clouds.
4.  **The Reincarnation Loop:** During the engagement, the Crew manages a lucky hit that should have neutralized the phantom. But seconds later, an identical heat signature appears in a different sector. Lem realizes that Tor has deployed a reincarnation system: the Core is capturing Rahu's spirit upon "death" and immediately projecting it into a new, pre-prepared vessel.
5.  **Tor's Command:** From the bridge of the Iron Pillar, General Tor orchestrates the flow of the battle. He is detached, treating the carnage as a necessary calculation to maintain the "Paradise" order. His presence is felt through the tactical perfection of the defense.
6.  **The Phantom Strike:** Ships continue to vanish. The Crew's communications net descends into chaos as they realize they are fighting an undefeatable ghost.
7.  **The Crew's Retreat:** As more flagships go down, the remaining human pilots pull their vehicles out of the immediate front line, realizing they are outmatched by a force that cannot be killed.
8.  **The Total Route:** The invisible foe—the reincarnating Rahu—dismantles the remaining Tree Army fleet with clinical efficiency. 
9.  **The Order to Withdraw:** Realizing they are fighting a ghost in the dust and chaos, Myrr orders the remaining forces to break engagement and return to their forest outpost. 

## Character Arc

### Lem
-   **The Obarchive of Hubris:** Lem realizes that the Crew's eagerness for battle led them to underestimate the Core's hidden depth and their ability to recycle aetheric spirits.
-   **The Recognition of General Tor:** Observing the Iron Pillar, Lem recognizes the signature of the "slumbering" strategist.

### General Tor
-   **The Detached Professional:** He does what he has to do, and who he knows he has to do, in order to get to "another event with dubious conclusion." He believes his carnage is the price of a future where he never has to order a battle again.

### Myrr
-   **The Tactician's Failure:** Myrr is forced to reckon with the "undefeatability" of the Core's new mechanics.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Cradle Zero Defenses:** Establishing that the terrestrial base is protected not just by numbers, but by specialized elite units.
-   **Reincarnation Failsafe:** The mechanics of capturing and redeploying a Vessel spirit in real-time.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The "Iron Pillar" should be described as a monolith of order amidst the chaotic dust of the battle.
-   The transition from "victory" to "rout" should happen as the realization of Rahu's reincarnation set in.

## World-Building Integration
-   **Cradle Zero Defenses:** Establishing that the terrestrial base is protected not just by numbers, but by specialized elite units.
-   **Automated Vulnerability:** Why "unmanned" fleets fail when faced with high-tier unconventional warfare.

## Notes for Phase C (Narrative Writing)
-   The explosions should feel sudden and terrifying—no warning, just a catastrophic failure of the ship's core.
-   Describe the dust and sand of the desert battle as a medium that the enemy is using to hide.
-   The transition from "victory" to "route" should happen in a matter of minutes.
