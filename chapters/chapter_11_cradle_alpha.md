# Chapter 11: Cradle Alpha

**Setting:** Lunar plain; Pyramid interior (Central hall)
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Iris Novak seizes command in the wake of the *Hermes*' catastrophic collision, framing Ajax's apparent sacrifice as a tactical necessity to push the mission forward. Lem pilots the strike force across a lunar plain buckled by seismic tremors, arriving at the massive Monolith of Cradle Alpha—the site of the original 1971 Synodic infection. Inside the humming geometric halls, the crew deploys heavy metal seals to shut out the lunar chaos, but the eerie silence of the nexus is shattered by a rhythmic pounding that deforms the newly installed plates. A scarred and scorched General Ajax emerges from the wreckage of the entry-port, revealing that his comms were fried in the crash. His survival comes with a grim revelation: Rahu has not been destroyed and is already waiting for them in the heart of the pyramid, forcing the team to follow Ajax on a final, high-stakes descent toward the inner chamber.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Command Shift:** Iris Novak’s voice comes over the general channel. She suggests Ajax's sacrifice was necessary to defend the mission and the Earth. She states that the corridor is clear and orders all units to advance toward the central pyramid.
2. **Strategic Reflection:** TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
3. **The Advance:** Lem drives his hovercraft across the plain. He passes the wreckage of the bikes and the remains of several Striders. The ground vibrates as if the rock itself is fracturing.
4. **Entry:** The strike force reaches the pyramid. The massive doors are open. The entire structure is humming with a faint fluorescence.
5. **Internal Logistics:** TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
6. **Securing the Perimeter:** Ground teams deploy heavy metal seals across the entry jambs. They lock the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside is muffled by the seal. They couldn't leave part of the crew outside the seal because the environment outside the pyramid was too unstable.
7. **Character Observation:** TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
8. **The Hall of the Nexus:** Inside the pyramid, Iris Novak stands in the center of the hall. She does not give the order to advance. She repeatedly checks a sequence of statistics on her tablet trying to decide what to do next.
9. **The Breach:** Suddenly there is a rhythmic pounding on the sealed outer door. The metal jambs buckle.
10. **Ajax's Entry:** General Ajax walks through the remains of the door. His suit is scorched and several metal plates had fused together. 
11. **The Impossible Return:** Iris and crew are shocked that Ajax is alive.
12. **The Apology:** Iris appologizes for the sealed door noting they didn't see Ajax's signal on the network anymore and figured he had died in the crash.
13. **Comms Failure:** Ajax responds briefly that his com had fried. 
14. **Status Report:** Iris continues reporting that the chamber is secure 
15. **The Grave Warning:** Ajax states: "No. Rahu waits in the chamber."
16. **The Inner Advance:** The crew quickly sheds their additional surprise at this statement and follow Ajax down the corridor heading towards the center of the pyramid.

## Draft (YOUNG_ADULT)
Iris Novak broadcasted a command over the general comms channel. She designated General Ajax’s previous actions as a necessary tactical sacrifice for mission security. She confirmed that the primary corridor was clear and authorized an immediate advance to the central pyramid. This site, designated as "Cradle Alpha," was identified as the location of a 1971 Apollo-class impact and the primary source of the Synodic infection.

I piloted the hovercraft across the lunar plain, bypassing the debris of multiple ground-vehicles and Strider units. Seismic sensors recorded high-frequency vibrations in the lunar crust. Upon arrival at the pyramid, we observed that the primary entry-gates were in an open configuration. The structure emitted a low-intensity green fluorescence. Ground teams installed heavy-duty metallic seals at the entry-points. The seal effectively reduced external acoustic data. The decision was made to finalize the seal due to increasing environmental instability outside the structure.

The interior contained high-tension cabling and non-standard power relays. Atmospheric sensors detected ozone concentrations. Technical teams initiated the deployment of a localized communication network. Iris Novak maintained a stationary position in the central hall. She monitored real-time mission statistics on a handheld console. Personnel in the vicinity displayed physiological signs of stress. 

External sensors recorded a series of high-impact strikes against the sealed door. The metallic structure suffered mechanical deformation. General Ajax entered the facility through the compromised entry-point. His armor displayed significant thermal scarring and fused plating. Ajax reported that the Wood Vessel (Rahu) was positioned in the inner chamber. He initiated an advance toward the inner nexus. The mission parameters shifted from defensive positioning to a direct encounter within the historical facility.

## Draft (13_PLUS)

"Advance," Iris Novak’s voice cut through the static, steady and absolute. "For the world we left behind. Do not stop."

<!-- TODO: Reflect on the historical or religious significance of this specific location/event. -->

We drove across the vibrating lunar plain, the ground singing beneath our treads. We reached the pyramid—a windowless monolith of geometric precision. 

<!-- TODO: Explicitly state how much time is passing during this description. -->

Once inside, the ground teams deployed heavy metal seals across the entry jambs and locked the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside was muffled by the seal. We were inside, and the environment outside had become too unstable to leave anyone behind.

The air inside the pyramid’s nexus was silent, heavy with the scent of ancient stone and the hum of a power that had waited eons to be released. Novak stood in the center of the hall, her presence a calm anchor in the rising tension as she checked a sequence of statistics on her tablet while waiting for the final command to echo through the corridors. The silence was shattered not by a voice, but by a rhythmic, bone-deep pounding. The heavy metal seals we had just placed began to buckle, groaning under a strength that defied the laws of the world outside.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the internal psychological state of the POV character here. -->

General Ajax stepped through the wreckage of the door, his suit a charred testament to his actions, a ruin of slagged metal and scorched ceramic. He didn't look like a defeated man; he looked like a reinforced structure that had survived a catastrophic failure. "He is waiting," Ajax grunted, his voice a gravelly rasp filled with grim determination.

<!-- TODO: Describe the specific sensory impact of the environment on the characters. -->
