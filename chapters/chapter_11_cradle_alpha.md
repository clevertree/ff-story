# Chapter 11: Cradle Alpha

**Setting:** Lunar plain; Pyramid interior (Central hall)
**Timeline:** Year Before Time (202X, Late); Day 0 AT (Cataclysm Day)

## Synopsis
Following the destruction of the flagship *Hermes*, Iris Novak takes command and orders the remaining human forces to advance across the lunar plain. Lem drives through the wreckage to reach the central lunar pyramid. Once inside, the teams deploy heavy metal seals to secure the perimeter, seeking refuge in the eerie silence of the hall. However, the peace is short-lived as a rhythmic pounding on the outer seals precedes the arrival of General Ajax, who enters the nexus with news that Rahu is waiting in the inner chamber.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **Command Shift:** Iris Novak’s voice comes over the general channel. She suggests Ajax's sacrifice was necessary to defend the mission and the Earth. She states that the corridor is clear and orders all units to advance toward the central pyramid.
2. TODO: Reflect on the political landscape and world power reactions.
3. **The Advance:** Lem drives his hovercraft across the plain. He passes the wreckage of the bikes and the remains of several Striders. The ground vibrates as if the rock itself is fracturing.
4. **Entry:** The strike force reaches the pyramid. The massive doors are open. The entire structure is humming with a faint fluorescence.
5. TODO: Detail the internal logistics (supply lines, power sources, communication nets).
6. **Securing the Perimeter:** Ground teams deploy heavy metal seals across the entry jambs. They lock the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside is muffled by the seal. They couldn't leave part of the crew outside the seal because the environment outside the pyramid was too unstable.
7. TODO: Describe the presence or actions of a specific background character.
8. **The Hall of the Nexus:** Inside the pyramid, Iris Novak stands in the center of the hall. She does not give the order to advance. She repeatedly checks a sequence of statistics on her tablet trying to decide what to do next.
9. **The Breach:** Suddenly there is a rhythmic pounding on the sealed outer door. The metal jambs buckle.
10. **Ajax's Entry:** General Ajax walks through the remains of the door. His suit is scorched and several metal plates had fused together. He does not stop to check his gear. He states: "Rahu waits in the chamber."

**YA Progress:** 25.0%
**13+ Progress:** 35.0%

Iris Novak’s voice came over the general channel, steady and assertive. She suggested that Ajax's sacrifice was necessary to defend the mission and the Earth. She stated that the corridor was clear and ordered all units to advance toward the central pyramid.

I drove my hovercraft across the plain, passing the wreckage of the bikes and the remains of several Striders. The ground vibrated as if the rock itself was fracturing. We reached the pyramid, where the massive doors were open. The entire structure was humming with a faint fluorescence. Once inside, the ground teams deployed heavy metal seals across the entry jambs and locked the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside was muffled by the seal. We were inside, and the environment outside had become too unstable to leave anyone behind.

Inside the pyramid, the air was still as Iris Novak stood in the center of the hall. She did not give the order to advance immediately, but instead repeatedly checked a sequence of statistics on her tablet. Suddenly, a rhythmic pounding started on the sealed outer door. The metal jambs began to buckle.

General Ajax walked through the remains of the door. His suit was scorched, and several metal plates had fused together from the heat. He did not stop to check his gear. "Rahu waits in the chamber," he stated, and led the group into the inner nexus.

"Advance," Iris Novak’s voice cut through the static, steady and absolute. "For the world we left behind. Do not stop."

We drove across the vibrating lunar plain, the ground singing beneath our treads. We reached the pyramid—a windowless monolith of geometric precision.

Once inside, the ground teams deployed heavy metal seals across the entry jambs and locked the plates into position. The sound of the moon's destructive chaos outside was muffled by the seal. We were inside, and the environment outside had become too unstable to leave anyone behind.

The air inside the pyramid’s nexus was silent, heavy with the scent of ancient stone and the hum of a power that had waited eons to be released. Novak stood in the center of the hall, her presence a calm anchor in the rising tension as she checked a sequence of statistics on her tablet while waiting for the final command to echo through the corridors. The silence was shattered not by a voice, but by a rhythmic, bone-deep pounding. The heavy metal seals we had just placed began to buckle, groaning under a strength that defied the laws of the world outside.

General Ajax stepped through the wreckage of the door, his suit a charred testament to his actions, a ruin of slagged metal and scorched ceramic. He didn't look like a defeated man; he looked like a reinforced structure that had survived a catastrophic failure. "He is waiting," Ajax grunted, his voice a gravelly rasp filled with grim determination.
