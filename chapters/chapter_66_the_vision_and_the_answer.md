# Chapter 66: The Vision and the Answer

## Synopsis
Maya disappears after the fall of the General. Machines unify to retake the Fire City, but Lem witnesses the Core’s internal schism in a vision. AI Lynn returns with the final directive: Mission 5.

## Key Beats
- The eerie silence after the fall; the void after the fire.
- The Core's machines begin a mindless, automatic reconstruction.
- Lem's vision of the "Circle of Three" (Novak, Drexler, Vane) arguing.
- The return of AI Lynn; the revelation that the Moon fragment is the final piece of the puzzle.
