# Chapter 3: Invasion

**Setting:** Ren's suburban home; Kansas
**Timeline:** 202X (Late), Day of Cataclysm (Day 0)

## Synopsis
The long-feared arrival of the Monoliths finally reaches Ren's doorstep. Waking to the literal earth-shaking impact of a lunar pod, Ren watches as the city's defenses are bypassed by the sheer proximity of the alien landing. As he watches from his street, a desperate military strike results in a catastrophic collateral Event. A damaged Monolith topples into his residential neighborhood, destroying his home and sending him into a dark unconsciousness.

**Chapter Beats:**
1. **The Impact:** Ren is jolted awake by a ground-shaking collision that rattles his house to its foundation.
2. **The Bulletin:** On the news, anonymous anchors report that the pod landings at the city's edge have rendered the military's perimeter defenses useless.
3. **The Authorized Strike:** Anchors debate the danger of destroying the Monoliths versus letting them finish their "job" before a flash bulletin confirms a strike has been authorized.
4. **The Fleeing Crowd:** Ren steps outside to see the Monoliths on the horizon. His neighbors are fleeing in terror, running toward the relative perceived safety of the downtown skyscrapers.
5. **The Engagement:** Military jets and helicopters engage the nearest Monolith. It falls heavily on a distant residential area.
6. **Retaliation:** The other Monoliths respond with pinpoint fire, swiping helicopters from the sky and targeting the high-speed jets as they continue their advance.
7. **The Collapse:** A second Monolith is heavily damaged and topples toward Ren's street. It crashes behind the houses, obscuring his view.
8. **The Shrapnel Cloud:** An explosion of fire and metal shards tears through Ren's street, destroying the houses around him. Ren's vision goes dark.

**POV:** Ren

## Draft (13_PLUS)

The world didn't end with a whimper. It ended with a sound so deep it didn't feel like noise—it felt like the earth itself had been struck by a hammer the size of a mountain.

I was thrown from my bed before I was even awake. The floorboards groaned, and the framed photos of my parents—the only things I had of them—shattered against the carpet. I scrambled for the remote, my hands shaking so hard I nearly dropped it.

The news anchor was nameless, a face of professional composure cracking under the weight of the ticker-tape scrolling across the bottom of the screen.

"...confirmed impacts at the western perimeter," the anchor was saying. "Initial reports suggest the pod trajectory bypassed the primary defense line. They landed too close to the residential sectors. The Army had the perimeter set, but there is no perimeter when the enemy drops directly into the yard."

A second anchor, off-screen, interrupted with a frantic update. "We have word from the Unified Command. A strike has been authorized. I repeat, a kinetic strike has been authorized within city limits. There is speculation among staff here that... that it might be more dangerous to destroy them than to let them finish, but the decision has been made."

I didn't wait for the rest. I ran to the front door and threw it open.

The sky was a bruised purple, choked with the dust of the impact. On the horizon, I saw them. The Monoliths. They weren't machines, and they weren't animals. They were stadium-sized titans loping on four spindly limbs, their movement a terrifying, rhythmic grace that mocked the gravity of our world.

People were pouring out of their houses, screaming. They weren't heading for the shelters; they were running toward downtown, toward the skyscrapers that looked like needles compared to the giants on the horizon.

Then came the roar of the engines.

A flight of jets screamed overhead, so low the windows in my house turned to powder. Helicopters rose from the hidden bases in the hills like a swarm of angry hornets. They opened fire. Missiles streaked through the dusty air, slamming into the lead Monolith. 

It didn't just die. It crumpled, a billion tons of alien alloy falling heavily onto a residential sector miles away. I saw the plume of fire and debris rise like a second sun.

The other Monoliths didn't flinch. They responded with beams of white-hot light that swatted the helicopters out of the sky as if they were nothing more than flies. The jets tried to peel away, but the giants were faster than they looked.

I watched, frozen, as the Monolith closest to my street took a direct hit to its primary support limb. It lurched, a sickening, grinding sound echoing through the air. It didn't fall away from us. It toppled forward.

It crashed into the ground three blocks behind my house, the impact sent a shockwave through the pavement that nearly broke my ankles. For a second, there was silence. Then, a secondary explosion erupted from the fallen giant.

A wall of fire and metal shards, each the size of a car, tore down the street. I saw my neighbor's house simply cease to exist. I didn't have time to scream before the heat hit me, and the world dissolved into black.
