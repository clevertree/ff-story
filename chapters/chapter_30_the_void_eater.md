## Draft (13_PLUS)
<!-- TODO (13_PLUS) -->
The 'Void-Eater' was the last remnant of the Fire Core—a singular, terrifying entity of absolute cold that lived in the space between the stars. It had been the original 'Reformatting' tool, and it was now descending toward the Earth to reclaim its lost geometry.

I didn't meet it with fire or wood. I met it with 'Nothingness.' I used the 'Gray' logic I had learned in the Red City—the element of the space between things.

The battle happened in the 'Silent Zone' of the upper atmosphere. The Void-Eater attacked with 'Universal Silence'—a frequency that sought to erase any vibration of life. I responded with the 'Echoes of the Wake'—the millions of silenced memories I had gathered from the Moon.

The Void-Eater couldn't process the complexity. It was designed to erase simple, singular lives. It wasn't built to handle a 'Collective Memory.' I watched the silver entity being overwhelmed by the weight of the people it had tried to forget. It didn't explode; it simply dissolved into a million points of light, each point finding its way back to the Earth to become a new star.

The threat was gone. The 'Final Sanitization' had been avoided. I floated in the silence of space, looking down at the blue and green marble below. The war was finally, truly over.
