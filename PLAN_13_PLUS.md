# Plan: Forgotten Future (13+ Version)

**Audience:** 13+ (Younger Audience)
**Tone:** Traditional / Heroic / Narrative
**Constraint:** Does NOT follow "Simple & Assertive Style" (Lem's Voice).

## Project Status: Parallel Track
This version is a secondary development track intended for a younger audience. It prioritizes emotional resonance, heroic beats, and more traditional narrative structures over the direct, laymen narration of the Young Adult (YA) version.

## Key Differences from YA Version
- **More Narrative Flourish:** Usage of metaphors and similes is encouraged to build atmosphere.
- **Explicit Emotion:** Characters' internal states (fear, excitement, grief) can be described more directly.
- **Traditional Dialogue:** Includes more direct character "quips" and dramatic moments that fit a standard sci-fi adventure.
- **Heroic Arc:** Emphasizes Lem's growth as a hero in a more conventional sense.
- **Game Like:** Emphasizes game-like aspects of the story, like character stats and abilities. don't make up abilities. I'll provide the details. Also the 5 elements have game-like qualities with strengths vs weaknesses and complex interaction. 
- **Illustrated:** Will include additional illustrations for kids.
- **Thematic Sanitization:**
    - **No Religious Terminology:** Avoid "reincarnation." Use technical or neutral terms like "Reconstitution," "Restoration," or "Awakening."
    - **Limited Political Weight:** Reduce emphasis on "New World Order" conspiracies or specific parallels to real-world indigenous genocide. The fall of the Selenites should be framed as a tragic historical mystery rather than an explicit systemic purge.
    - **Grounded Conflict:** Focus on the personal stakes and the immediate battle between good and evil rather than large-scale sociological critiques.
