# Plan: Forgotten Future (13+ Version)

**Audience:** 13+ (Younger Audience)
**Tone:** Grounded / Direct / Transition-Focused
**Constraint:** Follows a clear, accessible narrative style without dense metaphors.

## Project Status: Parallel Track
This version is a secondary development track intended for a younger audience. It prioritizes clarity, tactical beats, and the immediate reality of the transition over the complex metaphorical flourishes of earlier drafts.

## Key Differences from YA Version
- **Direct Narration:** While more descriptive than the YA track, it avoids overly poetic or abstract language.
- **Explicit Context:** Characters' internal states (fear, excitement, grief) are described clearly and pragmatically.
- **Action-Focused:** Emphasizes the technical and tactical aspects of the mission and the Wuxing elements.
- **Heroic Grounding:** Focuses on Lem's growth through his actions rather than high-heroism prose.
- **Game Like:** Emphasizes game-like aspects of the story, like character stats and abilities. don't make up abilities. I'll provide the details. Also the 5 elements have game-like qualities with strengths vs weaknesses and complex interaction. 
- **Illustrated:** Will include additional illustrations for kids.
- **Thematic Sanitization:**
    - **No Religious Terminology:** Avoid "reincarnation." Use technical or neutral terms like "Reconstitution," "Restoration," or "Awakening."
    - **Limited Political Weight:** Reduce emphasis on "New World Order" conspiracies or specific parallels to real-world indigenous genocide. The fall of the Selenites should be framed as a tragic historical mystery rather than an explicit systemic purge.
    - **Grounded Conflict:** Focus on the personal stakes and the immediate battle between good and evil rather than large-scale sociological critiques.
