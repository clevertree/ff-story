# Plan: Forgotten Future (13+ Version)

**Audience:** 13+ (Younger Audience)
**Tone:** Traditional / Heroic / Narrative
**Constraint:** Does NOT follow "Welsian/Clinical Style".

## Project Status: Parallel Track
This version is a secondary development track intended for a younger audience. It prioritizes emotional resonance, heroic beats, and more traditional narrative structures over the clinical detachment of the Young Adult (YA) version.

## Key Differences from YA Version
- **More Narrative Flourish:** Usage of metaphors and similes is encouraged to build atmosphere.
- **Explicit Emotion:** Characters' internal states (fear, excitement, grief) can be described more directly.
- **Traditional Dialogue:** Includes more direct character "quips" and dramatic moments that fit a standard sci-fi adventure.
- **Heroic Arc:** Emphasizes Lem's growth as a hero in a more conventional sense.

## Chapter Structure
(To be populated as development on this track begins. It will likely follow a similar 32-chapter arc but with adapted prose and pacing for a younger audience.)
