# Writing Strategies & Recommendations

To maintain the high bar of an "AI-Driven" story, we follow these specific strategies and keep an eye on industry standards. All work must adhere to the [AI Ethics for Modern Authorship](AI_ETHICS.md) guidelines.

> **Note for GitHub Copilot:** Each chapter in `ff-story/chapters/` contains two draft tracks: **YOUNG_ADULT** and **13_PLUS**.
> - The **YOUNG_ADULT** version uses **Ren's laymen perspective**. Follow the style rules in Section 6 religiously. It explores mature themes of **Indigenous Genocide** (Selenites), **New World Order** (Core control), and **Restoration**. This version has longer, more detailed chapters.
> - The **13_PLUS** version uses a **grounded and direct narrative voice**. It avoids dense metaphorical flourishes and "high-heroism" prose, focusing on the technical and tactical transition between eras. It **limits religious, political, and controversial themes**, as well as themes of **cultural appropriation**. Frame the Selenite absence as a mystery rather than a systemic purge. This version has shorter chapters with more illustrations.
> - **Always update both drafts** simultaneously with any changes to the chapter plan or synopsis. Maintain all content within the single chapter file to avoid sync issues.
> - **Note on Chapter Beats:** Do not rewrite, modify, or reorder the `Chapter Beats` unless explicitly asked to do so. Your role is primarily to synchronize the `Synopsis` and `Draft` sections with those established beats.

## ⚖️ Narrative & Content Divergence

| Feature              | Young Adult (YA) Edition                                                                                                                        | 13+ Core Edition                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vessel Autonomy**  | Vessel bodies can be remotely hijacked or "driven" by higher authorities, leading to disturbing loss of agency.                                 | No remote hijacking. All actions are voluntary or the result of organic persuasion/influence.                                    |
| **The Gorgons**      | Explicitly described as a slave labor force for the Core.                                                                                       | Status is implied through their behavior and role, but the term "slave" is never used.                                           |
| **Death/Legacy**     | **Reincarnation:** Spirits can be moved between biological/mechanical containers.                                                               | **Restoration:** Unique ability of Sydonic life to recover or re-knit themselves from fragments.                                 |
| **Selenite History** | Explores themes of systemic purge/indigenous genocide.                                                                                          | Presented as a cosmic mystery or a sudden, unexplained departure.                                                                |
| **Terminology**      | Religious and political terms from human history are used directly.                                                                             | Uses direct, tactical terms; avoids real-world controversy and dense metaphors.                                                  |
| **Spoiler Policy**   | **Pre-Informing:** Ren frequently mentions that he "did not know then" but learned later, providing the reader with early context and spoilers. | **Discovery-First:** Narrative avoids all spoilers, leaving every revelation as a surprise for the reader as Ren experiences it. |

## Core Strategies

### 0. The Singular Perspective (Ren's POV)
- **Constraint:** The entire narrative must be restricted to Ren's perspective. No other characters serve as POV narrators.
- **The Everyman Voice:** Ren is a normal human who has been thrust into a role he doesn't fully understand. He speaks and thinks in **laymen's terms**. He isn't a scientist, a soldier, or a robot. He is a guy from the suburbs trying to make sense of the end of the world.
- **Human Consciousness:** Ren and all other Vessels must be written with **human-like thoughts**. Avoid describing their internal experience as "software," "subroutines," or "processing." They are living beings enhanced by technology. They should reflect, wonder, and feel in a way that is indistinguishable from a human.
- **Application:** If a scene occurs where Ren is absent, it must be recounted through Ren's discovery of the event (e.g., reviewing surveillance, hearing a report, or interpreting residual data).

### 1. The Local Lens (Character-First)
- **Constraint:** Never explain a "Fact" through a narrator's voice if a character can experience it sensorially.
- **Application:** Instead of saying "The gravity was low," describe the character's struggle to keep their boots on the ground or the way dust settles too slowly.
- **Focus:** Sight, sound, smell, and tactile feedback. Keep descriptions simple and grounded in what an ordinary person would notice.

### 2. Show, Don't Tell (High Fidelity)
- Use strong, simple verbs and specific nouns.
- Avoid over-complicating emotions. Describe the physical sensation: the knot in the stomach, the dry throat, the shaking hands.

### 3. Consistency Over Convenience
- If a character needs to get from Point A to Point B, they must face the environmental hazards established in `facts.md`.

### 4. Technical Resonance (The Vane Lens)
- **Constraint:** Technical processes like reincarnation or scans should be described how they **feel** or **look** to an amateur, not how they function.
- **Simple Analogies:** Use everyday comparisons rather than scientific jargon. It shouldn't feel like "software tracking"; it should feel like "something heavy settling in the back of my head."

### 5. Atmospheric Immersion
- Reference the "Stars Die" tone. The mood should be a mix of cosmic awe and personal dread.

### 6. Welsian Clinical Style (Ren's Narrative)
To achieve Ren's direct, grounded, and retrospective tone:

## 🛡️ Accuracy & Fact-Checking Protocol (Fidelity to Source)
To prevent "hallucinations" or unsupported plot points, all drafting must follow these rules:
- **Strict Fidelity to Source:** Every sentence in the `Draft` sections must have a direct parent in the `Chapter Beats` or `Synopsis`. Do not invent new causal links, technical requirements, theories, metaphors, or realizations that are not explicitly documented in the planning sections of the file or the world-building documents.
- **Fact-Checking:** Before finalizing a draft or plan, verify all technical details (like the 360-day Tun, the Aether-Drive, or lunar fragmentation) against `world-building/facts.md`.
- **Everyday Terms:** Avoid technical or scientific jargon. Describe objects and events in terms of physical reality. It isn't "software tracking"; it is "something heavy settling in the back of my head."
- **Brief Declarative Sentences:** Use short, punchy facts. Impact comes from the weight of the facts, not stylistic embellishment.
- **No Assumptions:** Do not claim to know what others are feeling or thinking. Use physical evidence: the set of a jaw, the tremor in a hand, the specific volume of a voice. No "I didn't like how she said it."
- **Retrospective Disclosure:** Ren tells the story after it happened. He can fill in details learned later using "I did not know then..." but must highlight the moment of discovery as the main source of revelation.
- **No Clipboards or Anachronisms:** Use modern or future-appropriate tech (tablets, drones). Avoid generic or irrelevant clothing descriptions.
- **Assertive Clarity:** Ren states what he sees and feels without fluff. He doesn't second-guess his perceptions.
- **No Domestic Sentimentalism:** Emphasize institutional routine (orphanage, schedules) over family or domestic warmth.
- **Vague Subjects:** Avoid "they" or "she" without exposition. Be specific about vehicles, ranks, and personnel.

### 7. The Reality Filter (Independent Villages)
When writing for the independent villages (Wuxan Pentad, Voidsmen):
- **Truth as a Burden:** Truth is something that must be *protected* and *experienced*. Villagers reject any claim that is unprovable or contradictory.
- **Mistruth Viciousness:** Any sign of a lie or a "half-truth" is met with immediate, aggressive rejection.
- **Distrust of the Core:** The Core is seen as a source of "Industrial Witchcraft" and "digital ghosts." Any promise from the Core is viewed with the "Switch" caveat—the belief that it can all be taken away instantly.
- **The Analog Union:** For the Voidsmen, truth is verified through the **Analog Mind Link**, a process of total neural synchronization where "no corner is left unchecked."

### 8. Economic Sovereignty (The Switch Caveat)
When describing the divide between the **Allocation** and **Tribal Currency**:
- **Fragility vs. Stability:** Contrast the Core's "luxury cage" (post-scarcity but dependent) with the villages' "rugged poverty" (difficult but sovereign).
- **The Switch Imagery:** Use dialogue or internal monologue to highlight the danger of the Core's remote control. "Imagine having everything you ever wanted, and then losing it because someone you've never met flipped a switch."
- **Tangible Trade:** Emphasize physical tokens and the value of knowledge/rare resources over digital credits or technology.
- **The Value of Zero:** Explicitly avoid portraying gold, silver, or diamonds as having value to villagers. They are "worthless stones" associated with historical trauma and Core manipulation. Characterize jewelry as a mark of a "Core-brainwashed" citizen or a status-seeker from the Archipelago.
- **The LHC Rumor:** Use the 2015 Large Hadron Collider rumor (gold from lead) as a touchstone for why villagers trust only what they can grow or forge themselves.

## 🛡️ accuracy & fact-checking protocol
To prevent "hallucinations" or unsupported plot points, all drafting must follow these rules:
- **Strict Beat-to-Prose Mapping:** Every sentence in the `Draft` sections must have a direct parent in the `Chapter Beats` or `Synopsis`. Do not invent new causal links, technical requirements, or character motivations that are not explicitly documented in the planning sections of the file.
- **Voice vs. Fact:** Use the strategy rules (Section 6, etc.) only to determine **how** a character speaks or observes, never to determine **what** happens.
- **Evidence-Based Hooks:** Retrospective hooks (e.g., "I did not know then...") must only reveal facts that are already established in the `World-Building Integration` or metadata of that chapter. Never use a hook to introduce a new, unvetted "fact" about the world's physics or history.

## 🛡️ 13+ Core Style (Tactical Narrative)
To achieve the 13+ grounded, transition-focused tone:
- **Direct Action:** Focus on what is happening and how the machines/elements interact.
- **Simplified Heroism:** Characters are defined by their resilience and decisions rather than poetic descriptions of their internal "spirit."
- **Clear Transition:** Highlight the difference between the "Before Time" and the "After Time" using concrete examples of technology and environment changes.
- **Tactical Language:** Use terms like "Restoration," "Grounding," and "Lattice" in a way that feels like a natural part of the world's physics.
- **No Dense Metaphors:** Avoid similes that compare technological events to grand celestial or religious phenomena (e.g., avoid "stars died like tears"). Keep it grounded in the immediate scene.

## Publisher Recommendations

### What Modern Sci-Fi Publishers Look For:
- **Strong Hook:** A compelling "What If?" that is immediately apparent in the first 5 pages.
- **Unique Worldbuilding:** Markets are saturated with generic space opera. The "Shattered Moon" and "Mechanical Cells" provide a unique visual and conceptual hook.
- **Internal Logic:** Hard sci-fi or semi-hard sci-fi readers (and publishers) value a world that makes sense within its own rules.
- **Marketable Archetypes:** Characters with clear, relatable motivations (survival, loss, discovery) even in alien settings.

### What Publishers Usually Dislike:
- **The "Prologue Problem":** Too much deep history before the story starts. Start the action in the present.
- **Passive Protagonists:** Characters who are just observers of the apocalypse. They must have goals and take actions.
- **Info-Dumping:** Long blocks of text explaining the history of the Tripods. Weave this into the narrative through discovery.

## Waterfall Workflow for Chapters
- **Draft 0 (Concept):** 1-2 paragraphs of what happens and why it matters to the theme.
- **Draft 1 (Skeleton):** Bullet points of the scene sequence.
- **Draft 2 (Composition):** The actual prose, focusing on the Local Lens.
- **Draft 3 (Consistency Check):** Cross-referencing `facts.md` and character profiles.
- **Draft 4 (Polish):** Tone and cadence check.
