# Writing Strategies & Recommendations

To maintain the high bar of an "AI-Driven" story, we follow these specific strategies and keep an eye on industry standards.

> **Note for GitHub Copilot:** When adding new content (chapters/manuscripts), always update the "chapter plan" documents (e.g., `ff-story/chapters/INDEX.md`, `ff-story/synopsis.md`, and individual files in `ff-story/chapters/`) simultaneously with the manuscript text. Do not just edit the manuscript; ensure the structural roadmap and summaries reflect all new developments immediately.

## Core Strategies

### 0. The Singular Perspective (Lem's POV)
- **Constraint:** The entire narrative must be restricted to Lem's perspective. No other characters serve as POV narrators.
- **Human Consciousness:** Lem and all other Vessels must be written with **human-like thoughts**. Avoid describing their internal experience as "software," "subroutines," or "processing." They are living beings enhanced by technology, not robots. They should reflect, wonder, and feel in a way that is indistinguishable from a human, even if they lack full agency over their actions.
- **Application:** If a scene occurs where Lem is absent, it must be recounted through Lem's discovery of the event (e.g., reviewing surveillance, hearing a report, or interpreting residual data).

### 1. The Local Lens (Character-First)
- **Constraint:** Never explain a "Fact" through a narrator's voice if a character can experience it sensorially.
- **Application:** Instead of saying "The gravity was low," describe the character's struggle to keep their boots on the ground or the way dust settles too slowly.
- **Focus:** Sight, sound, smell, and tactile feedback of the "Forgotten Future" world.

### 2. Show, Don't Tell (High Fidelity)
- Use strong verbs and specific nouns.
- Avoid adverbs that explain emotion (e.g., "he said angrily"). Instead, describe the physical manifestation of the emotion (e.g., "he gripped the console until his knuckles turned white").

### 3. Consistency Over Convenience
- If a character needs to get from Point A to Point B, they must face the environmental hazards established in `facts.md`.
- No "Deus Ex Machina." If a solution is found, it must be rooted in previously established lore.

### 4. Technical Resonance (The Vane Lens)
- **Constraint:** When describing technical processes like reincarnation or aetheric scanning, use the terminology of "Ressonance" and "Frequencies."
- **Philosophy:** Dr. Vane's belief that Vessels are "Pure Elements" (Perfect Wood, Perfect Water) should inform how Lem experiences his own body and the aether around him. It isn't just "software tracking"; it's a spirit finding a home in a frequency that is too pure for natural biology to hold.
- **Atmosphere:** Reference the massive **Aetheric Beacons** as silent, ancient watchers that monitor the "Local Aether." Reincarnation shouldn't feel like a factory process, but like a spiritual resonance being captured by a global net.

### 5. Atmospheric Immersion
- Reference the "Stars Die" tone. The mood should be a mix of cosmic awe and impending dread.

## Publisher Recommendations

### What Modern Sci-Fi Publishers Look For:
- **Strong Hook:** A compelling "What If?" that is immediately apparent in the first 5 pages.
- **Unique Worldbuilding:** Markets are saturated with generic space opera. The "Shattered Moon" and "Mechanical Cells" provide a unique visual and conceptual hook.
- **Internal Logic:** Hard sci-fi or semi-hard sci-fi readers (and publishers) value a world that makes sense within its own rules.
- **Marketable Archetypes:** Characters with clear, relatable motivations (survival, loss, discovery) even in alien settings.

### What Publishers Usually Dislike:
- **The "Prologue Problem":** Too much deep history before the story starts. Start the action in the present.
- **Passive Protagonists:** Characters who are just observers of the apocalypse. They must have goals and take actions.
- **Info-Dumping:** Long blocks of text explaining the history of the Tripods. Weave this into the narrative through discovery.

## Waterfall Workflow for Chapters
- **Draft 0 (Concept):** 1-2 paragraphs of what happens and why it matters to the theme.
- **Draft 1 (Skeleton):** Bullet points of the scene sequence.
- **Draft 2 (Composition):** The actual prose, focusing on the Local Lens.
- **Draft 3 (Consistency Check):** Cross-referencing `facts.md` and character profiles.
- **Draft 4 (Polish):** Tone and cadence check.
