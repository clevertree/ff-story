# Writing Strategies & Recommendations

To maintain the high bar of an "AI-Driven" story, we follow these specific strategies and keep an eye on industry standards.

> **Note for GitHub Copilot:** You are currently drafting the **Young Adult** version. This version uses **Lem's laymen perspective**. Follow the style rules in Section 6 religiously. For the **13+** version, these rules do not apply, but that is a separate development track. Always update the "chapter plan" documents (e.g., `ff-story/PLAN_YOUNG_ADULT.md`, `ff-story/synopsis.md`, and individual files in `ff-story/chapters/`) simultaneously with the manuscript text.

## Core Strategies

### 0. The Singular Perspective (Lem's POV)
- **Constraint:** The entire narrative must be restricted to Lem's perspective. No other characters serve as POV narrators.
- **The Everyman Voice:** Lem is a normal human who has been thrust into a role he doesn't fully understand. He speaks and thinks in **laymen's terms**. He isn't a scientist, a soldier, or a robot. He is a guy from the suburbs trying to make sense of the end of the world.
- **Human Consciousness:** Lem and all other Vessels must be written with **human-like thoughts**. Avoid describing their internal experience as "software," "subroutines," or "processing." They are living beings enhanced by technology. They should reflect, wonder, and feel in a way that is indistinguishable from a human.
- **Application:** If a scene occurs where Lem is absent, it must be recounted through Lem's discovery of the event (e.g., reviewing surveillance, hearing a report, or interpreting residual data).

### 1. The Local Lens (Character-First)
- **Constraint:** Never explain a "Fact" through a narrator's voice if a character can experience it sensorially.
- **Application:** Instead of saying "The gravity was low," describe the character's struggle to keep their boots on the ground or the way dust settles too slowly.
- **Focus:** Sight, sound, smell, and tactile feedback. Keep descriptions simple and grounded in what an ordinary person would notice.

### 2. Show, Don't Tell (High Fidelity)
- Use strong, simple verbs and specific nouns.
- Avoid over-complicating emotions. Describe the physical sensation: the knot in the stomach, the dry throat, the shaking hands.

### 3. Consistency Over Convenience
- If a character needs to get from Point A to Point B, they must face the environmental hazards established in `facts.md`.

### 4. Technical Resonance (The Vane Lens)
- **Constraint:** Technical processes like reincarnation or scans should be described how they **feel** or **look** to an amateur, not how they function.
- **Simple Analogies:** Use everyday comparisons rather than scientific jargon. It shouldn't feel like "software tracking"; it should feel like "something heavy settling in the back of my head."

### 5. Atmospheric Immersion
- Reference the "Stars Die" tone. The mood should be a mix of cosmic awe and personal dread.

### 6. Simple & Assertive Style (Lem's Narrative)
To achieve Lem's unsophisticated, direct, and grounded tone:
- **Layman's Terms:** Avoid technical or scientific jargon. If Lem sees something complicated, he describes it in terms of things he knows (car engines, kitchen appliances, weather).
- **No Metaphors:** Lem is a direct witness. Avoid similes and metaphors. Instead of saying something was "like a stone" or "like a bad fact," describe the physical reality or the direct result of the event.
- **Simple Sentence Structure:** Prefer short, declarative sentences. Lem isn't a writer; he's a witness.
- **Assertive Clarity:** Lem states what he sees and feels without fluff. He doesn't second-guess his perceptions.
- **No Scientific Detachment:** Lem is bothered by what he sees. He experiences fear, confusion, and wonder as a person, not as an analyst.
- **Direct Address:** The narrative is a record. He speaks directly to whoever might be listening, but as a person, not a computer.

## Publisher Recommendations

### What Modern Sci-Fi Publishers Look For:
- **Strong Hook:** A compelling "What If?" that is immediately apparent in the first 5 pages.
- **Unique Worldbuilding:** Markets are saturated with generic space opera. The "Shattered Moon" and "Mechanical Cells" provide a unique visual and conceptual hook.
- **Internal Logic:** Hard sci-fi or semi-hard sci-fi readers (and publishers) value a world that makes sense within its own rules.
- **Marketable Archetypes:** Characters with clear, relatable motivations (survival, loss, discovery) even in alien settings.

### What Publishers Usually Dislike:
- **The "Prologue Problem":** Too much deep history before the story starts. Start the action in the present.
- **Passive Protagonists:** Characters who are just observers of the apocalypse. They must have goals and take actions.
- **Info-Dumping:** Long blocks of text explaining the history of the Tripods. Weave this into the narrative through discovery.

## Waterfall Workflow for Chapters
- **Draft 0 (Concept):** 1-2 paragraphs of what happens and why it matters to the theme.
- **Draft 1 (Skeleton):** Bullet points of the scene sequence.
- **Draft 2 (Composition):** The actual prose, focusing on the Local Lens.
- **Draft 3 (Consistency Check):** Cross-referencing `facts.md` and character profiles.
- **Draft 4 (Polish):** Tone and cadence check.
