## Chapter-to-Facts Cross-Reference

### Chapter 11-13: The Pyramid & The Reset
**World-Building Facts Applied:**
- ✅ **Elemental Conflicts** — Water (Lynn) quenches Fire (Rahu); Wood (Lem) provides the structure for the merger.
- ✅ **Vessel Deception** — Lynn reveals her true nature; the soldiers' mission is revealed as a precursor to a reset.
- ✅ **The Lunar Capacitor** — Revealed as the "nexus" Lynn uses to short-circuit the solar system.
- ✅ **Technology Failure** — Stasis weapons fail against high-tier elemental manipulation.
- ❓ **Open Question:** How does the Core track Vessel activity during the Reset cascade?

## Teaser Alignment

### Verse 1: "The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire"
- **Narrative Equivalent:** Chapters 1-10 (Lem witnesses Tripods; joins strike team; Moon fragments)
- **Teaser Imagery:** Moon destruction, heat/fire, emergence of the Tripods
- **Timing:** 202X (Late Year), Days before/during Cataclysm

### Chorus 1: "Stars die"
- **Narrative Equivalent:** Chapter 13 (Lynn initiates the solar system reset; the "Great Fry" begins)
- **Teaser Imagery:** Celestial unmaking; total energy discharge
- **Timing:** Cataclysm Day 1-8 AT

## World-Building Facts Confirmed by Chapters

1. ✅ **Lynn's Authority** — Confirmed by her ability to command the Lunar Capacitor and override military objectives.
2. ✅ **Vessel Merger** — Confirmed that Wood and Water can unify via the Aether-Drive to match high-tier Fire threats.
3. ✅ **The Lunar Capacitor's Purpose** — Confirmed as a "Reset" device rather than just a weapon of war.
4. ✅ **The Archivist Origin** — Confirmed that Core operatives (Novak/Iris) are positioned to witness and document the reset.

## Open Questions Raised by Chapters

### Critical (Must Resolve Before Next Section)
1. **The Archivist Survival Mechanism** — If the "Great Fry" (EMP) erases 99% of digital tech, how does the Core/Archivists preserve their "source of truth"? Are there shielded subterranean vaults or Aether-encoded data backups?
2. **Tor's Year 15 AT Departure** — How does the General leave the Moon's surface to become the "After Time wanderer" on Earth?
3. **Lem's "Fracture"** — Does the merger with Lynn leave Lem permanently altered (e.g., carrying Water traces) or merely exhausted?

### High Priority (Strongly Recommended Before "The Silence")
4. **Rahu's Transformation** — After his defeat and the reset initiation, how does Rahu evolve into the "Gorgon-like" lunar presence? Is it a survival response to the Capacitor's radiation?
5. **Humanity's "Wipe"** — How much of the human population survives the immediate Solar System Reset vs. the subsequent "Great Fry" famine/chaos?
6. **Lynn's Status** — Is she "dead" as an individual, or is she now a distributed intelligence within the solar system's new grid?

## Writing Continuity Checklist

- [X] **Before Next Section:** Clarify Lynn's knowledge of the Cataclysm timing (Ch 13 reveals her as architect)
- [X] **Before Next Section:** Define what Lem learns vs. knows instinctively (Ch 3-13 shows his gradual realization)
- [X] **Next Section (The Silence):** Document the immediate sensory aftermath of the Reset (The silence of the electromagnetic void)
- [ ] **Transition to After Time:** Explain the physical mechanism for Tor and Lem's return to Earth (if applicable)
