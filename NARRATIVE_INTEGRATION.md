## Open Questions Raised by Chapters

### Critical (Must Resolve Before Next Section)
1. **Linn's Role in the Cataclysm** — She is positioned as a decision-maker during the crisis. Is she aware of the Lunar Capacitor discharge beforehand?
2. **Lem's Knowledge Baseline** — How much does Lem know instinctively about his nature vs. learning through experience?
3. **The Moon Mission's Objective** — What is humanity actually trying to accomplish? (Damage the Capacitor? Rescue Selenites? Find a weakness?)

### High Priority (Strongly Recommended Before Cataclysm Sequence)
4. **Rahu's Current Location** — Is he on the Moon during the human arrival? Does the mission encounter him?
5. **The Soldiers' Fates** — How many survive the Cataclysm? Are they protagonists going forward?
6. **Linn's Escape/Transformation** — Does she survive the Cataclysm? How is she positioned for Year 15 AT?
