## Syncing the manuscript to the website 🔧

We use a **Live Fetch** model for the website. This means the website always pulls the latest content directly from the `main` branch of this repository.

1. **Update the Source:**
   - Edit `manuscript/FULL_MANUSCRIPT.md` to update the prose narrative.
   - Ensure you follow the header format (`# PART`, `# Chapter`, `## Synopsis`, `## Draft`) so the website parser can recognize the sections.

2. **Commit and Push:**
   - Once your changes are committed and pushed to `main`, the public website at `forgotten-future.site` will reflect your changes immediately upon refresh.

3. **Verify:**
   - Always check the website after a significant update to ensure the parsing logic correctly identified your new chapters or parts.

> Note: The legacy `scripts/sync_manuscript.py` is no longer used for public site updates.
