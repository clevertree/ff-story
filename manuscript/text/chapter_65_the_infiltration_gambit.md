# Chapter 65: The Infiltration Gambit

The humidity of the wilderness felt heavy, a thick blanket of aetheric mist and wood-sap that clung to my synthetic skin. We were camped on the ragged edge of the White Forest, looking south toward the horizon where the smog of the desert base—Cradle Zero—tinted the sky a bruised orange. 

Myrr was sitting by the holographic fire, her eyes hollow with the kind of disillusionment that only strikes those who have spent five years fighting a war they cannot win with lead and steel. Beside her, the rest of the crew—Silas’s son, Arlo’s best friend, and the few survivors from the Hive Cities who had defected—were checking their gear. Their weapons were hybrid wood-core tech, powerful enough to fell a Tripod, but we all knew the truth. 

Against the sheer scale of the desert base, our "Tree Army" was a drop of water in an ocean of fire. 

"We can't win by force, Lem," Myrr said, her voice barely more than a whisper. "We can take the outposts. We can disrupt the nodes. But if we march on the Cradle, we’ll be liquidated before we even see the walls."

The rest of the crew nodded. They were brave, but they were bound by their biology. None of them would dare remove their armored suits or drop their signal-jamming packs. To them, the desert base was a lethal zone of radiation and high-intensity surveillance. 

"One of us has to get inside," Jarek, the technician from the North, suggested. "We need to know what they're planning for the delegation. If they're really going to trigger Plan B, we need the exact frequency of the Beacon pulse."

They all looked at me. I was the only one who didn't need the armor. I was the only one who didn't pulse with a human's heat signature or have a heartbeat that their sensors could track. 

"It's risky," I told them. "They know my aetheric signature. Novak and Drexler... they haven't forgotten the 'King of the Gorgons.'"

"They haven't seen you since the Forest," Myrr said. "And besides, you're the only one who can't be killed by a standard security sweep. You move through risk like it’s a bad dream."

It was true. My sovereign status made me invulnerable to most physical hazards, but the digital net of the Core was a different story. Still, we had no choice. If we didn't learn what was happening inside while the Vane delegation was distracted in the North, we would be blind to the coming hammer-fall. 

Using their captured surveillance footage, Jarek and the others provided me with a "best guess" human profile—a low-level technician in the agricultural division. They showed me the colors, the gait, the subtle slouch of a man who spent his life staring at screens in a basement. 

I closed my eyes and focused on my Aether-Drive. 

I felt the Wood-core pulse and respond. It was a strange sensation, like trying to fold a piece of paper into a shape it wasn't meant to be. I pushed my physical form, shifting the density of my substrate, altering the color of my surface to mimic the dull greys and tans of the technician's uniform. I felt my height shrink, my shoulders narrow. 

"How is it?" I asked, opening my eyes. 

The crew was silent for a long moment. Jarek looked at me with a mix of awe and discomfort. 

"It... it looks like him from ten feet away," he said. "The colors are right. The shape is right."

"But?" I prompted. 

"But if anyone looks at you," Myrr finished, "they’ll know. Your eyes don't quite focus right. Your skin... it doesn't move like skin. It looks like you're wearing a costume made of static."

"It's the best I can do," I said, feeling the strain of the mask. "It isn't genuine."

"That's because your true look is the only one tied to your self-image," Myrr said softly. "You can't lie to your own ghost, Lem. But for a dash across the perimeter? It’ll have to be enough."

As I stood up, preparing to depart into the scorched dunes toward the heart of the Hive, the ground beneath me vibrated with a rhythmic thrum. It wasn't my transformation. It was the movement of the fleet. 

Somewhere in the South, the Archivists were preparing their final move. And I was walking directly into their arms. 

I pulled my hover-bike—a modified Synodic sled we’d stripped of its identifying Core beacons—from the brush. Following Rahu’s old camouflage trick, I reached out with a pulse of aether and let my surface textures bleed into the bike’s frame. In seconds, we were both the exact, parched tan of the desert dust. 

I kicked the drive into high gear. The distance between the forest and the Hive shouldn’t have been traversable in less than a day, but for a Vessel unburdened by the need for sleep or biological caution, the dunes became a flat, beige blur. I reached the outer perimeter of Cradle Zero within hours.

The city was a shock to the system. From the wilderness, it looked like a monolithic spire of metal and smoke, but as I navigated the winding walkways and desert-access paths, a more complex picture emerged. It was designed for people—or at least, the Archivists’ idea of people. There were streets, recognizable human-scale houses, and large public squares that felt like snapshots of the world before the Fry. 

But surrounding these human structures was the machine growth. Massive, organic-looking mounds of Synodic substrate had sprouted from the foundations, forming extra-dimensional spaces that hummed with a low-frequency power. Windows had been cut directly into the mounds’ matte surfaces, and arched entrances bridged the gap between the concrete and the alien. It was a sprawling, hybrid anatomy of glass and growth.

And the people... they were happy. 

I drifted through the walkways, my "technician" mask holding steady under the glare of the desert sun. I saw citizens sitting in open-air cafes, laughing and drinking water that tasted of pure filtration. There was no lack here. No jobs to perform, no quotas to fill. The machines handled the logistics of survival, leaving the humans with nothing to do but celebrate. 

Music blared from the mounds, a constant, festive pulse that drowned out the sound of the scanning drones overhead. I watched them party, their eyes bright with a manic kind of peace. It was a city-wide effort to keep their minds off the horrors outside—the grey smog, the fragmented moon, and the "new terrorist threat" the Archivists warned them about every hour on the public frequencies.

To them, we were the ghosts in the machine. A nameless, violent shadow out in the woods that wanted to take their paradise away. 

It wasn't hard to see that the Core had gotten exactly what they wanted. These people weren't like the villagers in the North—there was no weight to them, no friction. They were perpetually distracted, their eyes glazed with the shimmering feed of a hundred different entertainments. They were callous to the scars of the world, refusing to speak of the smog or the Moon or the wars. When they did mention the "terrorists," it was with a dismissive shudder, as if talking about a bad weather report.

The public news terminals, mounted on the Synodic mounds and broadcast across every open square, reinforced the delusion. I watched a crawl of headlines describing the recent attacks as "isolated acts of cowardice" by an unknown group. An investigation was underway, they promised. The "peace" would be maintained. 

Then, a familiar name caught my ear. A segment on the "Northern Ambassadorship" began, showing footage of the delegation to Arlo’s village. They portrayed it as a failure of diplomacy. Arlo—or "Harlow," as the anchor called him—was depicted as a hostile isolationist, refusing any form of communication and demanding the delegation leave immediately. The evidence was presented with clinical precision: eyewitness accounts, edited recordings, the testimony of disappointed "diplomats." 

I wondered if any of it was true. In the city, it looked like an objective fact, backed by the weight of a billion-dollar archive. But I knew the difference between a record and a reality.

I spent more time wandering, moving through the streets with the impunity of the invisible. Nobody looked at me. Nobody was afraid. I saw Gorgons everywhere—not the violent predators of the Forest, but docile, automated slaves. Some were tall, perched on Striders that raised and lowered them with hydraulic precision as they cleaned the windows of the high-rises or mended the Synodic mounds. No one flinched when a multi-limbed machine passed within an inch of their table. 

It was a slave-driven paradise. The Gorgons didn't look at the humans; they didn't look at anything. They seemed to draw their energy straight from the ground through translucent tethers, their limbs flailing with a precision that was entirely devoid of life. They were parts of the machine body of the city itself, as mindless as the pipes and the wires.

As I reached the city’s center, a vast plaza of white stone and glass, I stopped on a sidewalk. I stood there, watching the Gorgons atop the central spire, trying to reconcile the "Kings" of my forest with these mindless janitors. For a second, the flow of the city felt wrong. I was the only stationary point in a sea of moving bodies. I felt out of place, a glitch in the perfect, festive loop. 

Before the thought could turn into a retreat, I felt a firm tap on my shoulder. 

I turned, my pulse-rate spiking as I prepared to trigger a detonation. 

It was an older lady, her face etched with the kind of severe authority that time hadn't been able to soften. She didn't look like a technician, and she certainly didn't look like a reveler. 

I recognized her instantly. It was Iris.
