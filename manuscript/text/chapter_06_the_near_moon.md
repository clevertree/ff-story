# Chapter 6: The Near Moon

The screens in the transport ship were better than any telescope I’d ever seen, but even they couldn't seem to make sense of what we were looking at. To everyone on Earth, the Moon is just a distant light in the sky, something way up there. But as we got closer, I could see that the math I’d learned in school was just plain wrong. By the third hour of our flight, the Moon wasn't a circle anymore. It was a horizon.

I stood on the deck with the others, watching the transition from a star to a piece of ground. The soldiers were all crowded around the windows, their faces lit up by the harsh, unfiltered light of the lunar plains. The silence was total, except for the constant hum of the air machines and the sound of someone nearby breathing too fast.

"It's too big," someone whispered. It was one of the specialists, a guy who was supposed to know everything about how we were flying. "Look at the rangefinder. We should only be halfway there. Why is it blocking out the stars already?"

I watched the screen. The numbers were flickering, trying to record data that didn't fit into the ship's computer. We weren't halfway. We were already falling into the Moon’s gravity, but we hadn't been flying nearly long enough to be this close. The only answer that made sense was one that made my stomach turn: the Moon wasn't two hundred thousand miles away. It was right there, practically in our front yard, hidden for a hundred years by fake maps and managed news.

As we got closer, the proof was right in front of us. The Moon wasn't a dead, dusty rock. As we moved over the edge where the light hit the dark, I saw a faint, glowing blue line tracing the edges of the craters. It was a thin layer of air, catching the sunlight and turning it into a pale, electric blue.

"Atmosphere," a lieutenant muttered, his voice flat with shock. "Look at the way the light catches the edge. There’s air down there."

He was right. I could feel the ship start to vibrate, a low-frequency shudder that told me we were hitting something thicker than a vacuum. This wasn't the lifeless rock from the history books. This was a place where things could live.

The news seemed to break something in the crew. If the distance was a lie, and the air was a secret, then everything we’d ever been told was a fake. I watched them start to fall apart—their hands were shaking, their eyes were wide, and they were arguing in hushed, panicked voices. They weren't just scared of the mission anymore; they were scared of the world they’d been living in.

Through the window, I started to see shapes on the surface. They weren't mountains. They were huge, crystalline towers that seemed to pulse with a slow, heavy rhythm. They looked like mechanical forests, their long branches reaching up into the dark to catch the energy from space.

"They've been here all along," a sergeant said, backing away from the glass like he’d been punched. "We didn't go to them. They were already here." 

The ship’s alarm started to chime—a warning that we were entering the atmosphere. The metal walls groaned as they hit the first resistance of the lunar air. To the soldiers, it sounded like the world was breaking. To me, it just sounded like a machine coming home.

I stayed quiet, watching them unravel. They looked at the Moon and saw a monster. I looked at it and saw a massive energy nest that was already starting to hum. 

We weren't just getting close. We were being pulled in.
