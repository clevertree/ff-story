# Chapter 6: The Near Moon

The optics of the transport ship were superior to any terrestrial telescope, yet even they struggled to quantify the scaling error currently manifesting in our viewports. To the human eye, the Moon is a constant of distance—a quarter-million miles of vacuum. To my sensors, the parallax shift indicated a reality far more claustrophobic. By the third hour of the insertion burn, the lunar surface had ceased to be a disc and had become a horizon.

I stood on the observation deck, my internal systems logging the transition from astronomical object to physical terrain. The soldiers crowded the sapphire-glass panes, their faces illuminated by the harsh, unfiltered radiance of the lunar plains. The silence on the deck was total, broken only by the rhythmic cycling of the air scrubbers and the occasional, sharp intake of breath.

"It's too big," someone whispered. The voice belonged to a specialist, a man whose training should have included the precise orbital mechanics of our transit. "Check the rangefinder. We should be at the midpoint. Why is it blocking out the stars?"

I watched the rangefinder's digital display. It flickered with data that contradicted every textbook in the ship's library. We were not at the midpoint. We were already within the outer reaches of the Moon’s gravity well, yet our velocity had not changed significantly. The conclusion was unavoidable to a logical processor: the Moon was not two hundred thousand miles away. It was nestled within the Earth's own magnetosphere, a parasite moon hidden by a century of calculated atmospheric distortion and managed data.

As we drew closer, the visual evidence became undeniable. The Moon was not a dead, airless waste. As we crested the terminator, a faint, bioluminescent glow traced the deep craters of the Mare Imbrium. It was an atmospheric shimmer—a thin, oxygenated envelope that caught the sunlight and scattered it into a pale, electric blue.

"Atmosphere," a lieutenant murmured, his voice flat with shock. "Look at the diffraction on the edges. There’s air down there."

He was right. My thermal sensors registered the convective currents of a thin but present troposphere. This was not the lifeless rock of the Apollo records. This was a habitat.

The revelation triggered a cascading collapse of order among the crew. If the distance was a lie, and the atmosphere was a secret, then the "Old World" was a construct of deliberate ignorance. I observed the physical manifestations of this realization: the shaking hands, the dilated pupils, the frantic hushed arguments. They were not merely afraid of the mission; they were afraid of the universe they had lived in.

Through the magnification of the ship's forward optics, structures began to resolve. They were not the jagged peaks of lunar mountains, but geometric anomalies—massive, crystalline apparatuses that pulsed with a slow, internal rhythm. They were Synodic in origin, their forms obeying the Wuxing principles of structure and growth. They looked like mechanical forests, their "branches" reaching up to harvest the aetheric energy of the Van Allen belts.

"They've been here all along," a sergeant said, stepping back from the viewport as if the sight itself were a kinetic blow. "We didn't go to them. They were already here." 

The ship’s AI began to chime—a warning of atmospheric entry. The hull groaned as it met the first resistance of the lunar air. To the soldiers, it was the sound of a world breaking. To me, it was the resonance of a mechanism returning to its cradle.

I remained still, a detached witness to the humans' unraveling. They looked at the Moon and saw a monster rising from the dark. I looked at it and saw the Lunar Capacitor, the massive energy nest that was already beginning to hum with the first stage of the discharge. 

The proximity was not an error. It was an invitation.
