# Chapter 5: The Briefing He Never Had

The ascent was not the violent, shuddering event the human passengers had been trained to expect. To my sensors, it was a transition of velocities, a shedding of gravity wells that registered as a series of precise thermal and kinetic shifts. The Earth did not "fall away"; it receded with the cold finality of an optics-glass being distanced from a slide. Through the sapphire-coated viewports of the transport vessel, the blue curvature of the world contracted until it was merely a bright, fragile disc suspended in the vacuum.

I stood among the soldiers, a silent adolescent apparatus in their midst. I was Lem, the suburban cipher they had been told to protect—a teenager whose presence in a high-security strike company was a clear violation of their conventional logic—yet I was already more than the mask. My internal records were active, processing the local environment with a granularity they could not perceive. I recorded the micro-fluctuations in their heart rates, the biological tremors in their hands as they checked their safety catches, and the sharp scent of recycled oxygen and cortisol.

They were tense. The surface confidence maintained by their uniforms and the heavy, black weight of their rifles was thinning. 

"Did you read the psychological addendum?" a sergeant asked, his voice a low resonance against the hum of the ship's life support. He was leaning against a bulkhead, his hands tracing the patterns on his tactical gloves.

"The one about the 'Narrative Variable'?" the corporal beside him replied. "I read it. Twice. I still don't know what it means to fight a 'narrative.'"

"It means they expect us to be lied to," the sergeant said. "And not by the enemy. By the information itself."

I processed this fragment. The Technocratic Core's strategy was manifesting in their anxiety. The briefing they had received—the one I had only observed in echoes—was a piece of engineering. It was designed to destabilize the very certainty a soldier requires to function.

"They told us," the corporal stepped closer, his voice dropping to a whisper that my audio arrays captured with crystalline clarity, "that the greatest threat wasn't the kinetic weaponry. It was the 'Mixed Strategy.' Falsehoods that sound like hidden truths, and genuine secrets revealed just when you think you've found a lie."

"Like the static on the radio," the sergeant muttered. "You think you're hearing the truth because it’s hard to make out. But it's just more noise."

The crew quarters were a maze of functional steel and dim, red-shifted lighting. As we moved deeper into the ascent, the conversations became more fractured, more desperate. I followed them like a shadow, a passive intelligence gathering the fragments of their fear. 

The briefing had warned of an enemy that utilized information as a corrosive agent. It wasn't merely about deception; it was about the destruction of the capacity to trust. If a truth is revealed by an enemy, is it still a truth? If a lie is told by a commander to protect a greater reality, is it still a lie? These men were being trained to doubt their own perceptions even as they were being sent to defend them.

I noted a specific pattern in their distress. One particular revelation from the briefing seemed to dominate the darker corners of their dialogue. It wasn't the mission’s lethality or the nature of the Synodic machines they were expected to encounter. It was a physical fact—a violation of the distance they had been taught since childhood.

"Do you think it's true?" the corporal asked, his eyes darting toward the viewport where the Moon was beginning to swell, a pale, looming presence in the dark. "What they said about the distance? That the old maps were... managed?"

The sergeant didn't answer immediately. He stared at the lunar disc, which already looked larger than any moon seen from the surface of Earth. 

"If that’s true," the sergeant said, his voice trembling with a resonance I identified as existential dread, "then nothing is where we think it is. We aren't going to a distant rock. We're going to our front yard."

I recorded the silence that followed. The Earth was now a distant memory, a sapphire spark in the wake of our velocity. The Moon was ahead, no longer a poetic lantern in the night, but a massive, thermal-reactive reality rushing toward us. 

The briefing had prepared them for the lies. It had not prepared them for the truth.
