# Chapter 5: The Briefing He Never Had

The climb into space wasn't the violent, shaking event the soldiers had been warned about. To me, it felt more like a sudden lightness, a shedding of weight that made my stomach float. The Earth didn't look like it was falling away; it just got smaller, a quiet blue marble being pulled back until it was just a tiny, fragile-looking thing in the black.

I stood there among the soldiers, a teenager they’d mostly been told to ignore. I was Lem, the kid from the suburbs that shouldn't have been there. But I was already seeing things they weren't. I could hear the tiny, fast drumming of their hearts. I could see the way their hands twitched as they checked their guns, and the sharp, sweaty smell of recycled air and fear.

They were terrified. The tough look of their uniforms and the heavy black rifles didn't seem to be helping much.

"Did you read that psych report?" a sergeant asked, his voice low against the constant hum of the ship. He was leaning against a metal pillar, picking at the stitching on his gloves.

"The one about 'Information Warfare'?" the guy next to him asked. "I read it. Still don't get what it means to fight an 'idea.'"

"It means they expect us to be lied to," the sergeant said. "And not just by the enemy. By the news, by the briefings... maybe even by the guys paying us."

I listened. The people who ran this mission—the Technocratic Core—were already messing with their heads. The briefing they’d been given was like a puzzle designed to make them doubt everything.

"They told us," the other soldier said, leaning in close, "that the real danger wasn’t the machines. It was the stuff they were going to tell us. Lies that sound like truths, and truths that they only let out when they want to trick you."

"Like static on the radio," the sergeant muttered. "You think you're hearing something important because it’s hard to understand. But maybe it’s just more noise."

The crew area was a maze of metal tubes and dim red lights. As we got further from Earth, the talk got more jagged and desperate. I followed them like a ghost, just a quiet kid catching the pieces of their panic.

The briefing had warned them of an enemy that didn't just fight with lasers and bombs, but with doubt. If an enemy tells you something that’s true, do you believe them? If your boss tells you a lie to keep you from panicking, is he still the good guy? These men were being trained to doubt their own eyes even as they were being sent to fight.

I heard them talking about some old prophecy, too—something about a "King of Terror." They said the higher-ups had been using it as a template, a way to make people believe a disaster that happened yesterday was actually ancient history. These soldiers weren't just fighting tripods; they were being used in an experiment to see how much a human could be tricked into forgetting.

But there was one thing that seemed to scare them more than anything else. It wasn't the mission or the machines. It was a physical fact—something they’d been taught since they were children that was now turning out to be a lie.

"Do you think it's true?" the younger soldier asked, his eyes fixed on the porthole where the Moon was starting to look huge, a pale, looming thing in the dark. "What they said about the maps? That the distance was... managed?"

The sergeant didn't say anything for a long time. He just stared at the lunar disc, which already looked bigger than any moon I’d ever seen from my backyard. 

"If that’s true," the sergeant said, his voice actually shaking, "then nothing is where we think it is. We aren't going to a rock in the sky. We're going to our own front yard."

I recorded the silence. The Earth was just a tiny blue spark now. The Moon was ahead, no longer a pretty light in the night, but a massive, terrifying reality rushing toward us. 

The briefing had told them about the lies. It hadn't warned them about the truth.
