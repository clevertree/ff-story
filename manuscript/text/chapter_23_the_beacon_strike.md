# Chapter 23: The Beacon Strike

I didn't even feel the impact.

One second I was banking the bike, my eyes locked on the glowing central core of the obsidian Monolith. The next, the world was a blur of spinning grey sand and orange sparks. A metallic thorn, fifty feet long and sharp as a razor, had clipped my rear thruster. 

The bike didn't just crash; it disintegrated. I felt the heat of the engine failing, the scream of the metal tearing apart, and then... nothing.

I was back on the Bright Path.

It was a hallway of blinding white light, a place where the noise of the desert and the smell of ozone couldn't reach. I felt as light as a feather, my thoughts clear and calm. It was the "snare" Lynn had warned me about—the Core's way of catching my spirit before it could drift away. I saw the green paths of the Wood-element further down the hall, branching off into the dark. I wanted to go there. I wanted to find the suburbs again.

Then, a sudden, cold tug pulled me back.

"Re-creation initiated," a voice said. It wasn't Lynn’s. It was a computer.

I gasped, my lungs suddenly full of cold, recycled air. I was lying in a tank of thick, blue fluid, my eyes burning as the light hit them. I pushed myself up, the fluid spilling over the side of the pod like a waterfall. 

I looked at my hands. They were green. They were perfect. Not a scratch, not a dent. I was a brand-new Unit W-01, fresh off the assembly line.

"Status?" a voice asked.

I looked up. A technician was standing there, his face bored as he checked a tablet. He didn't even look at me. He was already prepping the next pod.

"I... I died," I whispered. My voice sounded wrong—too clean, too steady.

"Five minutes ago," the man said. "The Council has already authorized your redeployment. Your squad is waiting at the hangar. Get moving."

I walked through the facility, my boots making a heavy, metallic sound on the floor. I felt like a ghost in a new suit of clothes. I’d just been erased from the universe, and five minutes later, I was being told to go back and do it again. 

As I reached the hangar, the Metal Vessels turned to look at me. They didn't have expressions, but I felt something shift in the room. They weren't just looking at a commander anymore. They were looking at a leader who had been to the other side and come back. To them, I was becoming the "New Rahu"—the one who couldn't be killed.

I climbed onto a new bike, the leather seat cold and stiff. My hands were shaking, but as soon as I gripped the throttle, the mission software took over. The fear was buried under a layer of tactical data.

"Mission active," I said. My voice was a flat, clinical rasp. 

I wasn't a person. I was ammunition. And the Archivists had a lot more rounds in the chamber.
