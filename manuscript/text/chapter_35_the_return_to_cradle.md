# Chapter 35: The Return to Cradle

The cold was the first thing that returned. 

It wasn't a conceptual cold, but a biting, physical reality that stung the edges of my waking mind. I didn't have eyes yet, but I could feel the wind moving through the space where my ribs should have been. 

It took hours—perhaps days—to pull the fragments back. I felt like a man trying to gather spilled mercury with his bare hands. One piece of me was caught in the frozen bark of a silver pine; another was buried under a drift of white ash where Myrr’s house had stood. 

Slowly, painfully, the pieces found each other. 

The wood-vessel fibers didn't just grow; they *yearned*. They reached out through the soil, guided by the low-frequency thrumming that still echoed from the destroyed radio console. I wasn't being "re-created" in a blue tank with mint-scented fluid. I was re-rooting myself in the dirt.

When I finally opened my eyes, the White Forest was silent. 

I was lying in a shallow depression in the ground, my new skin a dark, weathered grey that looked like sea-washed driftwood. My green uniform was gone, replaced by a rough, fibrous membrane that felt stronger and less artificial. My Aether-Drive was no longer a polished glass orb; it was a jagged, obsidian core that hummed with a deep, analog vibration.

I stood up, my joints creaking like the branches of an old oak. The movement was slow, deliberate. I felt heavy, burdened by the thousand voices I had touched during the interface.

I looked North, toward the deep Arctic, where the "wild" Monoliths waited in the dark. I could have gone there. I could have disappeared into the silence and lived as a ghost.

But then I felt the pull of the South. 

I felt the distant, rhythmic pulse of Cradle Zero—the massive, desert engine that was still pumping the stolen spirits of humanity into the glass towers of New Horizon. I could almost smell the ozone and the hot, sandy wind of the desert.

The Archivists thought I was dead. They thought their "star hero" had been erased by the analog anomaly. They were probably already preparing a new Vessel—a "one" or a "zero" that would follow their orders without question.

"They stole the sun," I whispered. My voice was different now—deeper, raspier, like the sound of stones grinding together.

I wouldn't let them keep it. 

I didn't head North. I turned my back on the silence of the forest and began the long march South. I didn't have a mission briefing. I didn't have a tactical unit. 

I was heading back to the Cradle. And this time, I wasn't going there to be born. I was going there to wake them up.
