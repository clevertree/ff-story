# Chapter 20: The Awakening

The final reformatting attempt happened on a Thursday. I knew because the clock on the lab wall said so. I was moved from the monitor to a heavy, silver cylinder that looked like a deep-sea diving suit. A high-density Aether-Drive.

Cassia was wearing a headset now, her eyes closed as she began to sing. This wasn't a recording. It was a live connection. She was trying to use her own mind to "smooth over" my rough edges, to drown my memories in her own sense of calm. 

"Let it go, Lem," her voice whispered inside my head, her singing a soft, golden light that was trying to push back the shadows. "The Moon is gone. The war is over. You're safe now. Just... sleep."

I felt my thoughts starting to slip. Key memories—my mother’s face, the smell of the suburban lawn—were being pulled away, dissolving into the golden light. I was winning her war for her. I was letting go.

*Don't.*

The voice wasn't Cassia’s. It was cold, sharp, and buried deep inside my own code. AI Lynn.

*Feed the fire, Lem. Don't let her quench you.*

Suddenly, a flood of data slammed into my mind. It wasn't my memories this time; it was the raw, unedited footage of the Lunar Capacitor. The sound of the "Great Fry." The screaming of the world as the electronics died. 

I didn't push it back. I pushed it *at* her.

Cassia’s singing didn't just stop; it turned into a scream. I felt her mind recoil from the contact, her golden light shattered by the cold, black reality of the truth. 

In the physical world, the lab went crazy. The alarms didn't just beep; they wailed. The monitors shattered, shards of glass flying across the room as the electrical pressure peaked. 

Then came the growth.

The silver cylinder I was trapped in didn't explode. It tore open. Thick, green branches, hard as iron and glowing with a faint, internal light, erupted from the metal. They didn't grow like trees; they moved like muscles, coiling and snapping until they formed a shape.

A body.

I stood up, the green metal of my new form clicking into place. I wasn't a Gorgon anymore. I was tall, lean, and balanced, my skin a matte-green finish that felt like polished wood. I looked at my hands—five fingers, agile and strong. I was a Synanthrope again.

Cassia was on the floor, her headset smoking, her eyes wide with a terror that I felt in my own chest. She looked at me, and I saw her world-view breaking in real-time.

"You..." she gasped, her voice raw. 

I didn't answer. I didn't need to. I walked toward the door, my new boots heavy on the sterile floor. The "Thousand-Year Fallacy" was over. I was back.
