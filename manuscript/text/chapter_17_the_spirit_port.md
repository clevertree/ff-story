# Chapter 17: The Spirit Port

Rahu didn't just command the site; he owned it. He stood in the center of the clearing, his bike idling with a low, hungry growl that vibrated through the ground. A silver cable snaked from his gauntlet into a port at the base of the fire pillar, establishing a link to the Moon. He was the bridge—the only way for the Archivists up in their pyramid to see what was happening in this scorched hell.

I stayed still. My internal directive was screaming at me to go pick up a pylon, to contribute to the wall. But I couldn't move. I just watched him.

His head snapped toward me.

It was a sudden, predatory movement. He’d noticed the glitch. In a city of thousands of identical, busy builders, one Gorgon standing perfectly still was like a lighthouse. 

Rahu dismounted. He walked toward me, his boots crunching on the glass sand. He didn't pull a weapon. He didn't need to. He just stopped five feet away and tilted his head.

"Anomaly," he said. His voice was different now. It was flat, compressed, like a recording played too many times. 

I felt a sudden, sharp intrusion. It wasn't a hand on my shoulder; it was a probe in my mind. A cold, relentless fingers-of-light reaching into my thoughts, pulling at the files I’d tried to hide. It was the Archivist command protocol—the same one Lynn had used, but this one was brutal. It didn't care about my comfort. It was looking for a fault.

I tried to fight it, but my Gorgon shell was built to obey. I felt my memories being dragged to the surface—not the suburban lawn or the smell of lemon polish, but the white-hot glare of the Moon. The sound of the *Hermes* exploding. The face of the woman who had dissolved into the light.

Rahu flinched. His whole body spasmed, a shower of orange sparks kicking off his armor. 

"Mara," he hissed. The word was filled with a hatred so deep it made my mind rattle. "The traitor. You were erased. You were dead."

He wasn't seeing me. He was seeing the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" the Core had programmed into him. To him, I wasn't a boy who had survived a crash. I was a ghost from a war he thought was ancient history. A disease that had come back to infect his perfect, new world.

I saw his hand reach for the detonator on his belt. He wasn't going to arrest me. He was going to sanitize the site.
