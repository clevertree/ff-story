# Chapter 14: The White Forest

**Title:** The White Forest
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Interspersed with electronic components, the forest featured trees that emitted a pale light and a low hum. There were no animals, as the machines were fully integrated into the environment.

A skilled technician named Myrr told me he had been monitoring my previous units. When he called me the 'King of the Gorgons,' I accepted the title.

He placed a device on my head and used a specialized cable to read analog signals, bypassing the Core's security. After Myrr found data the Core had attempted to delete, his access to files about the Moon triggered a security failsafe. The system sent a destructive signal through the link and destroyed my unit in the subsequent explosion.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the analog procedure clinical but humane.
- Make Myrr's motives practical rather than heroic; he wants survival more than myth.
- Emphasize the forest's silence as a sign of its intelligence.

## Synopsis
Mission 4: Infiltration of the "White Forest" dead zone.
