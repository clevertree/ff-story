# Chapter 32: The Grinding Path

The next three weeks were a blur of screaming metal and blue fluid.

I died four times. 

Each time, the Archivists would scrape my "spirit" from the Aether, patch up my wood-vessel body, and drop me back into the White Forest. They were obsessed. They didn't care about the support units anymore. They just wanted me to reach the center. 

"The snake was a gatekeeper," Novak told me during my third reconstitution. Her face was a digital projection, flickering in the blue vat. "It was checking your signature. Now that you’ve been 'tagged,' the forest will let you deeper. Keep moving."

But moving was like walking through a meat-grinder. 

The White Forest was alive with "analog" defenses. Old security drones from the pre-Fry era that had been modified with organic parts. They didn't use lasers; they used high-velocity shards of glass and clouds of corrosive gas.

I spent my days crawling through frozen maintenance ducts and scaling ice-covered cliffs. My green uniform was now a collection of rags, held together by duct tape and my own hardened sap. My hands were permanently stained with black machine-oil and red, human blood.

The "grind" began to eat at my mind. The high-detail memories the snake had triggered wouldn't go away. I’d be in the middle of a firefight, and suddenly I’d be smelling fresh-cut grass or hearing my father’s car pulling into the driveway.

The two worlds were merging. The "After Time" was becoming a transparency laid over the "Before Time."

"It’s just sensor-ghosts, Lem," Cassia said during a brief comms window. "The analog signals are interfering with your Aetheric balance. Don't let them in."

But I *wanted* them in. The ghost-suburbs were warmer than the silver forest.

I reached the center on the twenty-second day. 

The silver trees suddenly ended, as if they’d been cut by a giant’s blade. I stepped out into a clearing that shouldn't have existed. 

The air was warm—not synthetic-warm like New Horizon, but the heavy, humid heat of a summer afternoon. There was no snow. No ice. Just a field of tall, golden grass that swayed in a gentle breeze.

In the center of the clearing sat a building. It wasn't a glass tower or a stone hut. It was a bungalow. A red-brick house with white shutters and a porch swing. It was the house from my memories.

But standing on the porch was something that didn't belong in any suburb. 

It was a Gorgon. 

But it wasn't wired into a tank. It was sitting in a rocking chair, its chrome limbs resting on its knees. It was holding a book—an actual, paper book—and its skeletal head was tilted as if it was reading by the light of a sun that wasn't there.

I walked toward the porch, my boots crushing the golden grass. The sound wasn't a chime or a chime. It was just... grass.

The Gorgon looked up. Its lenses weren't glowing red or blue. They were clear, like window glass.

"You’re late, Lem," the machine said. Its voice wasn't digital static. It sounded like an old man who had spent too much time in the sun. "The tea is already cold."
