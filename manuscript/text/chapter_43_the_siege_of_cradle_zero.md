# Chapter 53: The Blackout

The Node was hollow. 

My Wood-Grown Monoliths had finished the dismantling, their sync-metal fingers stripping away the silver-blue crystal casing to reveal a core of raw, unmanaged energy. But to our mounting confusion, the Hive City beside it remained untouched. The cyan towers continued to shimmer, the suspended gardens continued to bloom, and the atmospheric scrubbers continued to hum their low, satisfying song. 

"It’s a shell," Myrr whispered over the comms, his voice tight. "The whole thing is a decoy."

"There’s one more component," I said, my senses locking onto a massive, cylindrical cable that snaked from the center of the Node directly into the city's foundation. It was shielded by ten layers of high-density lead and pulsar-mesh. "This has to be the control link."

"Sever it," Myrr ordered. 

The Monoliths stepped forward, their arms straining as they gripped the cable. With a single, rhythmic pull that vibrated through the dunes, the link was severed. 

The blackout was instantaneous. 

It wasn't a fade or a flickering of lights. It was a giant switch being flicked off across miles of urban landscape. One moment the Hive City was a mountain of captured stars, and the next, it was a black hole in the desert. The silence that followed was absolute, terrifying, and perfect. 

"We did it," one of the guards cheered. "The city’s dark! The logic is broken!"

But as I monitored the emergency airwaves, the celebration died in my throat. 

The standard static of the blackout wasn't there. Instead, a high-priority, high-bandwidth signal immediately replaced every channel. 

"Attention! Attention!" a voice boomed, calm and practiced. It wasn't an automated recording; it was a live briefing. "The terrorist enemy has just struck the city's primary power node. Hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens are currently without life-support. The terrorist advance is seeking to dismantle our humanity. Stay in your bunkers. Do not attempt to leave."

The broadcast switched to a video feed of a man sitting in a plush, sunlit office inside the city—his room powered by a backup generator that our "blackout" hadn't touched. 

"I had no idea," the man said, his face a mask of weary, civilized grief. He was identified on the screen as **The Project Architect**. "I had no idea that terrorists even existed in our world. I had no idea that anyone would seek to destroy the sacred power grid that keeps our children safe. We are a democracy of survival, and we are under attack by the ghosts of the past."

"My God," Myrr said, his voice breaking. 

I watched the "Architect" speak, and I realized the terrifying depth of the trap. The Core hadn't defended the Node because they *wanted* us to destroy it. They had sacrificed a piece of their own infrastructure to give their "Utopia" a villain. 

We weren't liberators anymore. We were the "ghosts of the past" that justified every invisible heat-ray, every pulsar-blast, and every "meat-component" in the wall. 

"Lem, order the retreat," Myrr said. 

"Retreat?" one of the guards shouted. "We just took out a city's power! We should be moving on the Desert Base!"

"We've been defeated," Myrr replied, his voice flat and dead. "We’ve been walked into a narrative trap, and we didn't even see the gate close. Drexler isn't fighting us with tanks; he’s fighting us with cameras. If we stay here, we’re just playing the part he’s written for us."

"Cease monitoring," I commanded. 

In the desert, the Headless Striders and the Wood-Grown Monoliths turned back toward the shadows of our forward base. They moved with the same orderly, unthinking precision as before, leaving the dark city behind. 

I looked at the black towers of the Hive City, and I realized that Myrr was right. We had won the battle of the Node, but we had lost the war of the world.
