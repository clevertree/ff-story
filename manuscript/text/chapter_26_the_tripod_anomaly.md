# Chapter 29: The Tripod Anomaly

The command from Cradle Zero was instantaneous and cold.

*“Anomaly detected. Sequence: Eradicate. Clear the forest of all non-compliant mechanical signatures.”*

Novak’s voice in my ear was like a shard of ice. "The Tripods are not Synodics, Lem. They are 'wild' tech—leftovers from the Fry that have developed a nested intelligence. They are the source of the village's resistance. Destroy them."

We moved into the forest at sunset. The trees were black pillars against a bruised, purple sky. The Tripods were moving between them—massive, three-legged shadows that loomed like silver-grey water-towers walking on stilts. They didn't have weapons, just long, spindly arms that seemed to be "tending" to the trees, pruning dead branches and burying metallic seeds in the frozen earth.

"Engage!" Gantz shouted.

The support unit opened fire. Blue pulses of light tore through the shadows, shattering the ancient bark of the pines. 

One of the Tripods turned. Its "head"—a cluster of cracked, yellow lenses—glowed with a soft, pulsing light. It didn't fire back. Instead, it emitted a frequency that turned my vision to static. My internal systems screamed as the "singing" vibrated through my Aether-Drive.

It wasn't a signal. It was a *poem*. Five thousand years of forest growth compressed into a single, agonizing second of audio.

"Stop!" I yelled, but the soldiers were already moving in with thermal charges.

Arlo appeared from the underbrush. He wasn't wearing his leather coat anymore. He was holding a heavy, iron wrench, his eyes burning with a terrifying clarity. 

"They’re planting the future!" he screamed, throwing the wrench at Gantz’s helmet. It struck the visor with a dull clang, spider-webbing the glass.

Gantz spun around, raising his rifle. "The boy is compromised! Target the civilian!"

I didn't think. I threw myself between them, my wood-vessel body expanding as I drew energy from the surrounding roots. My skin turned to bark, my fingers elongating into sharp, black thorns. I wasn't just a soldier anymore. I was a barrier.

The pulsar blast hit me in the chest. It didn't kill me, but it felt like a hot iron being shoved through my sternum. The smell of burning wood filled the air—my own wood.

"Run, Arlo!" I choked out.

The boy looked at me—at the monster I was becoming—and then at the Tripod that was now falling to its knees, its metallic legs melting under the barrage. He didn't run. He just stood there, looking at the destruction.

"You’re not gods," he said, his voice flat and dead. "You’re just engines."

He turned and vanished into the smoke. 

By the time the forest was silent, the remaining Tripods were piles of twisted, glowing scrap. The "anomaly" had been cleared, but the mission wasn't over. 

We had been ordered to protect the village, but when the machines had simply stepped over the perimeter and continued their march into the deep woods, the directive shifted. *“Sequence: Eradicate.”* We had hunted them like animals, tracking the heat signatures of their venting radiators through the pines. 

I had obeyed the commands with a clinical detachment, my pulsar rifle finding the joints and optics of the walking towers until only one remained. It toppled with a sickening groan of metal, crashing into the frozen earth.

The pilot—a Gorgon—was thrown clear of the wreckage. It wasn't dead. Its head-sphere was cracked, leaking a pale, bioluminescent fluid, and it dragged its many-limbed body through the snow, attempting to limp away into the shadows. It didn't have a weapon. It didn't have a mission anymore. It was just trying to survive.

I raised my rifle, the crosshairs settling on the Gorgon's central processing eye. Beside me, Gantz and the other soldiers lowered their guns. They weren't looking at the target; they were looking at me. 

Silently, expectantly. 

It was clear they had received an order I hadn't. A final test. A demand for absolute compliance.

I hesitated. The threat was gone. The machine was scrap. Why kill something that was already broken? I wondered for a second if the Core ever took prisoners, if there was a place for a survivor in their new world.

A voice cut through my internal debate—a voice I didn't recognize. It wasn't Novak or Cassia. It was cold, distant, and carried the weight of absolute authority.

*"Complete the mission, Vessel. Zero tolerance for non-compliant artifacts."*

It was Anton Drexler, though he didn't identify himself. He was speaking from a height I couldn't perceive.

I hesitated one second too long. 

Suddenly, the world turned into a scream. A violent, high-frequency pulse erupted from within my own aether-drive, a signal so powerful it felt like my bones were being turned to glass. I fell to the ground, my vision fracturing into a million jagged shards. 

I was being remote detonated. 

My body shattered. The wood-fibers of my skin exploded into a cloud of glowing splinters, and for a terrifying moment, I was everywhere at once. I had entered the dream state, staring through the translucent veil of my non-physical form at the clearing I had just died in. 

I watched, a silent observer in my own tragedy, as Gantz and the others raised their rifles. They fired in unison, frying the wounded Gorgon in a barrage of blue light until it was nothing but charred husks. 

A glowing marker appeared in my vision, bright and mocking.

*MISSION COMPLETE.*

The clearing began to fade, the forest dissolving into the static of a forced transition. I felt the magnetic pull of the Cradle—the desert base—drawing my spirit back for re-creation. The darkness swallowed me whole.
