# Chapter 60: The Core Debate

The air in the High Council chamber of Cradle Zero was recirculated, filtered through seven layers of Synodic mesh, and tuned to a precise humidity that prevented the corrosion of the ancient, pre-Fry server-stacks. It was a room that smelled of nothingness. 

Dr. Elowen Vane adjusted her spectacles, the weight of the last twenty years pressing down on her shoulders. She looked across the polished metal table at Anton Drexler. He hadn't aged; the Archivists had seen to that, his "biological maintenance" being a priority of the state. He looked exactly as he had in 202X—sharp, clinical, and entirely void of the doubt that was currently eating Elowen alive. 

"The data is unequivocal," Novak said, her voice echoing in the silent room. She tapped a holographic display, and a map of the Northern clusters appeared. "The 'Arlo' signature is a match for the Maya-Spirit. Ninety-nine point nine percent convergence on the Water-Element frequency."

"And the village?" Drexler asked, his voice low and bored. 

"Thriving," Novak replied. "They’re using non-digital thermal energy. They’ve built a decentralized communication network using wood-core relays. It's crude, but it’s invisible to our primary suppression grid. And they’re growing, Anton. People from the Hive Cities—mostly the Year 15 AT generation—are defecting. They’re walking into the desert and not coming back."

"A cultural contagion," Drexler said, his fingers drumming on the table. "Induced by the presence of a rogue Vessel. We’ve seen this before. In 1971. In 202X. The Water spirit is inherently disruptive to the Metal structure."

"She’s a child of the new world," Elowen spoke up, her voice surprisingly steady. "Arlo isn't Lynn. He has no memory of the Moon. He’s just a boy who wants to protect his home. If we treat him like a monster, we *make* him a monster."

Drexler turned his gaze to her, and for a moment, Elowen felt like a specimen under a microscope. "We aren't discussing morality, Elowen. We are discussing the stability of the Thousand-Year Fallacy. If the citizens realize that a 'god' is living in the North, the Archivists' claim to the liberation of the Moon becomes a lie. The Beacon-Network becomes a prison. We lose the narrative."

He leaned forward, the hologram reflecting in his cold, gray eyes. 

"We have three options," he continued. "Plan A: Capture. We send Rahu in to retrieve the boy. We place the spirit in cryo-stasis and let the village wither. Plan B: Consumption. We activate a Beacon-Pulse in the North. We kill the boy and 'eat' the aetheric signal before it can reincarnate. Plan C: Negotiation. We offer him a place in the Hive. We make him an Archivist."

"Negotiation with a Vessel is a fallacy in itself," Novak countered. "They don't think like we do. They are elemental forces. You don't negotiate with a flood."

"And you don't 'eat' a flood either," Elowen said. "If you kill him now, the splash-back from the Water-Element would be catastrophic. You’d trigger a localized reset that would wipe out everything within a hundred miles. Including our northern relay-stations."

The room went silent. This was the fear that had kept them in a stalemate for five years. They were afraid of the "unleashed unknown." They were afraid that the boy's spirit was more powerful than their technology. 

"So we wait?" Drexler asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "We wait for him to grow up? To find Lem? To start the war?"

"We don't wait," Elowen said. "We send an emissary. A human one. Someone who doesn't look like a soldier or a god. Someone who can speak his language."

"A diplomatic gambit," Novak mused. "It would buy us time to finalize the Plan B Beacon-Pulse if he refuses."

Drexler looked at Elowen for a long moment. "And who would you suggest for this suicidal mission, Doctor?"

Elowen looked at the holographic map of the North—at the green clusters that represented a world she had helped destroy. 

"I'll go," she said.
