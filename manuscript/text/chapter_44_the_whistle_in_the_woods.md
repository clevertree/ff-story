# Chapter 44: The Whistle in the Woods

I stood on the ridge, watching the smoke rise from North-Haven. To my aetheric-trained eyes, the village wasn't just a cluster of stone and wood; it was a low-frequency hum of life, a stubborn, biological rhythm in a world that had otherwise gone silent or turned to invisible screaming. 

The Archivists hadn't touched this place. No beacons. No drones. No pulsar-pings. It was a technical anomaly, an island of the Before Time that the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" had somehow missed. 

I paused, my hand resting on the trunk of a massive pine. I was about to begin my descent, to find Arlo and see if the "Maya" Myrr had seen in the data was real. 

Then came the whistle. 

It wasn't a bird. It was a sharp, melodic pattern—three rising notes followed by a sudden, rhythmic drop. It was a human signal, old and practiced. 

I froze. My internal senses—the high-tier instincts I’d spent five years perfecting in the wilderness—had told me I was alone. No heat signatures. No heartbeat. No electromagnetic noise. Whoever was behind me was effectively invisible to my intuition. 

I turned slowly, my hand instinctively reaching for the "Key" signature buried in my very being, ready to manifest a defense if the first shot came from the brush. 

"Don't expose yourself yet, Vessel."

The figure was standing twenty paces away, partially obscured by the thick trunk of a pine. At first, I didn't recognize him. He was taller than I remembered, his frame broader and more muscular. He was draped in a patchwork of scavenged armor—matte-black plating held together by leather straps and copper wiring. On his back was an oversized rifle that looked like it had been built from the skeletal remains of a Core sniper drone. 

It was Myrr. 

But it wasn't the tired, bandaged man who had limped away from the White Forest. This was a soldier. His face was hardened by a decade of conflict, his eyes sharp and unnervingly steady. 

"Myrr?" I whispered. 

The initial wariness on his face dissolved into a look of pure, raw relief. He stayed low, signaling for me to retreat further into the tree line, back toward the secluded clearing where my hovercraft had bloomed. 

"You've been off the radar for a long time, Lem," he said, his voice a low rasp. "Even our long-range vacuum-shunts couldn't find you. We thought you’d finally gone into the deep-sleep."

"I was in the wilderness," I said, following him into the shadows. "Evaluating the data."

We reached the clearing where my "Blooming" trees stood. A group of other survivors—Myrr’s "Crew"—were waiting there, huddled around a small, smokeless fire. They were all wearing the same patchwork armor, their faces hidden behind copper-mesh masks. 

Myrr sat on a fallen log and gestured for me to do the same. "When we were linked in the White Forest... I saw more than just your mission records, Lem. I saw the Archive. I saw the Moon. I saw the trio of missions the Core forced on you. And I saw the name."

"Maya," I said. 

"The legend of Witch Maya is well-known in these villages," Myrr replied, his eyes dark. "A woman who sees the future, who speaks to the machines, who was supposedly erased by the Archivists a millennium ago. But our surveillance suggests she hasn't been seen in the village recently. The elders are... protective."

He explained why he and his crew were back in the North. After the destruction of the White Forest, his people had split. Most had gone to a "final sanctuary" deep underground, a place where they would never be found, but also where they could never leave. Myrr and a handful of others had chosen a different path. 

"I couldn't hide away from this world, Lem," he said, his hand resting on the stock of his rifle. "I felt too responsible. Your existence... it proved that even a small group could understand and challenge the Core’s technology. We’re here to take them out."

"How?" I asked. "You don't even have a link anymore."

Myrr sighed, a look of frustration crossing his face. "That’s the missing link. Even if we find Maya, we have no way to bridge the gap between her human consciousness and the Vessel memories. We don't have a Human Interface Device. Ours was lost in the fire. We can tell her the truth until we’re blue in the face, but anyone sane would reject it as a fairy tale."

I looked at Myrr, and then I looked at the "Blooming" trees I’d created from the hovercraft. 

"Wait," I said. 

I entered the deep dream state. I didn't look for a weapon or a vehicle. I looked for the specific, intricate design of the HID—the bridge-technology the Core used to link a human mind to a Vessel’s consciousness. I had the blueprint in the infinite database Lynn had given me. 

The Crew watched in a stunned, silent awe as my power pulsed through the clearing. A green light began to flow from my fingers into the branches of the nearest tree. The wood didn't catch fire; it rearranged itself. The fibers warped and fused, weaving into a small, familiar shape. 

I pulled the object from the branch. 

It was a perfect replica of the Human Interface Device—a matte-black headset with vacuum-tube emitters and copper-threaded nodes. It didn't look like Core tech; it looked like it belonged in the White Forest. 

I handed it to Myrr. 

He took it with trembling hands, his eyes wide. This was the moment his "brave pretending" turned into genuine hope. 

"It’s real," he whispered. 

"It’s a start," I said. 

Myrr looked at the village in the valley. "We’ve made zero progress with the villagers. They forbid any technology—even our analogs. They’re terrified of us. But you... you’ve shed the Core’s exterior. You look like one of their legends, Lem."

He looked at me, his eyes filled with a new, strategic clarity. "Go in alone. Unarmed. Investigate the village, find Arlo, and see if Witch Maya is still there. We’ll be right here in the shadows."

I nodded. I didn't need a rifle. I didn't need armor. 

I headed toward the valley, a single, green-skinned boy walking into a photograph that was about to be torn.
