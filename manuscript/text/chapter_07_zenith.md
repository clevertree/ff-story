# Chapter 7: Zenith

The ship reached its zenith—the point where the arc of our climb finally flattened against the curve of the lunar horizon—at precisely 04:00. At this altitude, the Moon was no longer a sphere in the sky; it was a wall. A landscape of bleached bone and shadow that felt like it was pressing against the hull with a physical weight. The shadows in the craters weren't just dark; they were absolute, like holes cut into the fabric of the universe.

The pressure of it finally broke the bridge.

The man was a corporal—Miller. I’d seen him in the mess hall, always the one who talked loudest about the "Mission." Now, his breathing was a panicked, wet rasp that seemed to vibrate through the very floorboards.

"It's fake!" he screamed. His voice was raw, cracking under a frequency of pure terror. "Look at it! It’s right there! Why is it moving? The shadows—they're moving like they're alive!"

The other soldiers moved toward him, but their movements were slow, weighted by their own shock. They looked like men wading through deep water. "Easy, Miller. It's just the glass. The magnification..."

"Don't lie!" Miller shrieked. He was clutching the rim of his console so hard his knuckles were white as the craters outside. "We're not in space! We're in a cage! The whole world is a cage!"

The bridge came to a dead stop. Hands froze over keys. Eyes that should have been on the descent monitors were fixed on the looming, impossible plains of the Mare Moscoviense. The abstract fear we’d lived with for months had finally become a physical reality, and Miller was just the first to crack under the sight.

Then the bulkhead door behind us cycled open, the sound of the hydraulics a sharp, metallic hiss.

Lynn walked in.

The room didn’t just go quiet; it felt like the air itself was suddenly drained of heat. She didn't march; she simply occupied the space, moving with a calm, rhythmic focus that made the soldiers’ struggle look frantic and clumsy. Behind her came Commander Novak, her eyes narrow and scanning the room with the practiced efficiency of a predator.

Lynn didn't even look at Miller at first. She walked straight to the main viewing port, her silhouette a dark, sharp line against the lunar glare. She stood there for a long time, just watching the bone-white desert below.

"Commander," Lynn said. Her voice wasn't loud, but it had a weight to it that cut through the silence like a knife. "Status."

Novak stepped forward, her voice tight but disciplined. "Psychological fracture, Ma'am. Corporal Miller. He passed his psych-evals, but the... the scale of it. He can’t reconcile it."

Lynn turned. Her eyes weren't glowing or different, but they were terrifyingly steady. She looked at Miller, who was now pinned to the deck by two of his friends. He was sobbing now, a pathetic, rhythmic sound that echoed in the small space.

"The scale isn't the problem," Novak added softly. "It’s the realization that everything he knew was a lie. He’s seeing the Moon as it is, not as he was told it should be."

Lynn walked toward Miller. The soldiers holding him instinctively let go, backing away. Miller looked up at her, his face slick with sweat.

"Is it real?" he gasped. "Is it really that close?"

Lynn crouched down. For a second, I thought she might touch his hand, might offer him some human comfort. 

"It’s always been this close," she said, her voice quiet, almost regretful. "You just spent your whole life looking through a filter that was designed to save you from this moment. I’m sorry, Corporal. I really am. But we can’t have your fear on this ship."

She looked at Novak. "The panic will spread. It’s like a hum in the wires. We need it to stop."

"There's no brig on a ship this size, Ma'am," Novak said. "And we’re already in the descent window."

"Then put him in a pod," Lynn said.

The silence that followed was so heavy I could hear the hum of the air recyclers. The soldiers stared. Miller’s sobbing just... stopped. His eyes went wide, reflecting the white light of the Moon.

"Ma'am?" Novak asked.

"Launch a survival pod," Lynn ordered. "Set the telemetry for a high-arc return. If the atmosphere catches him right, he might make it back to the Pacific. If not..." she didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to. "Now, Commander. Before the rest of the crew starts hearing what he's hearing."

It was fast. Miller didn't even scream anymore; he just looked at her with a hollow, broken expression as they dragged him out. I heard the scuff of his boots, a fading sound that ended with the heavy *thud* of the airlock cycle.

A minute later, a small spark of light drifted away from the hull. It looked like a falling star, heading back toward the blue marble of Earth, so small and fragile against the black.

Lynn didn't watch it. She went to the sensor array, her fingers moving across the physical buttons with a speed that felt like a dancer’s. 

"Back to your posts," she said. "The Moon isn't a theory anymore. It's the ground. Focus on the landing, or you'll end up like him—drifting."

The crew moved. They weren't brave, but they were terrified of her, and that was enough. They became parts of a machine again, their movements stiff and mechanical as we began the final dive into the shadows of the far side.

As the ship tilted, a low-frequency vibration began to rattle my teeth. It wasn't the engines. 

"The General is waiting," Novak whispered to no one.

I felt a sudden, sharp ache behind my eyes—the Aether-Drive, pulling at me like a tether. We had reached the zenith. The fall had begun.
