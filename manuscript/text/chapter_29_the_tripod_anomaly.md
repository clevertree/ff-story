# Chapter 29: The Tripod Anomaly

The command from Cradle Zero was instantaneous and cold.

*“Anomaly detected. Sequence: Eradicate. Clear the forest of all non-compliant mechanical signatures.”*

Novak’s voice in my ear was like a shard of ice. "The Tripods are not Synodics, Lem. They are 'wild' tech—leftovers from the Fry that have developed a nested intelligence. They are the source of the village's resistance. Destroy them."

We moved into the forest at sunset. The trees were black pillars against a bruised, purple sky. The Tripods were moving between them—massive, three-legged shadows that looked like rusted water-towers walking on stilts. They didn't have weapons, just long, spindly arms that seemed to be "tending" to the trees, pruning dead branches and burying metallic seeds in the frozen earth.

"Engage!" Gantz shouted.

The support unit opened fire. Blue pulses of light tore through the shadows, shattering the ancient bark of the pines. 

One of the Tripods turned. Its "head"—a cluster of cracked, yellow lenses—glowed with a soft, pulsing light. It didn't fire back. Instead, it emitted a frequency that turned my vision to static. My internal systems screamed as the "singing" vibrated through my Aether-Drive.

It wasn't a signal. It was a *poem*. Five thousand years of forest growth compressed into a single, agonizing second of audio.

"Stop!" I yelled, but the soldiers were already moving in with thermal charges.

Arlo appeared from the underbrush. He wasn't wearing his leather coat anymore. He was holding a heavy, iron wrench, his eyes burning with a terrifying clarity. 

"They’re planting the future!" he screamed, throwing the wrench at Gantz’s helmet. It struck the visor with a dull clang, spider-webbing the glass.

Gantz spun around, raising his rifle. "The boy is compromised! Target the civilian!"

I didn't think. I threw myself between them, my wood-vessel body expanding as I drew energy from the surrounding roots. My skin turned to bark, my fingers elongating into sharp, black thorns. I wasn't just a soldier anymore. I was a barrier.

The pulsar blast hit me in the chest. It didn't kill me, but it felt like a hot iron being shoved through my sternum. The smell of burning wood filled the air—my own wood.

"Run, Arlo!" I choked out.

The boy looked at me—at the monster I was becoming—and then at the Tripod that was now falling to its knees, its metallic legs melting under the barrage. He didn't run. He just stood there, looking at the destruction.

"You’re not gods," he said, his voice flat and dead. "You’re just engines."

He turned and vanished into the smoke. 

By the time the forest was silent, three Tripods were piles of twisted, glowing scrap. The "anomaly" had been cleared. The village was defenseless. 

I sat in the snow, watching my own chest smolder. My Aether-Drive was rebooting, showing me a flickering image of the Moon—the shattered Moon from fifteen years ago. 

"Mission success," Novak’s voice crackled. "Report to the spirit-port for re-integration."

I looked at the melted remains of the Tripods. They hadn't been fighting us. They had just been waiting for the spring.
