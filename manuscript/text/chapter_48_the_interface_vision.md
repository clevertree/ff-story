# Chapter 48: The Interface Vision

The HID helmet didn't look like a piece of technology anymore. 

Sitting on the rough-hewn table in the center of the camp, it looked like a crown from a forgotten kingdom. The vacuum tubes inside were pulsing with a slow, rhythmic blue light—the "Water" frequency—that seemed to be reaching out to Arlo as he stared at it. 

He didn't move for a long time. The "Crew" stood in the shadows, their eyes fixed on the man who had banned all things digital, now standing before the most forbidden device of all. 

"If I put this on," Arlo asked, his voice barely a whisper, "who comes back out?"

"You," I said. "Only you. I'm just opening a window, Arlo. You’re the one who has to look through it."

With a steady, trembling hand, Arlo reached for the helmet. He placed it over his head, the copper nodes clicking into place against his temples. I initiated the link, my Aether-Drive spinning up to a frequency I hadn't used in five years. 

The clearing vanished. 

We weren't in a forest anymore. We were standing in the core of my own recursive dreamscape—a landscape of shifting rivers of light, shimmering memories, and translucent geometric shapes that looked like a map of the universe stretched across eternity. 

Usually, the dreamscape was "Wood"—dense, intricate, and textured like bark. But the moment Arlo entered, it changed. The air became fluid, the threads of light rippling like currents in a deep river. The static on the horizon turned into a soft, blue spray. Arlo wasn't just observing the Aether; he was influencing it. 

"This is a lot of noise," he said, his voice echoing in the void. He didn't sound scared; he sounded focused. He began to walk, his feet leaving ripples on the floor of the dream. 

"Don't fight the currents," I said, walking beside him. "Follow the path backward. Find the Moon."

We traced the "Path of Fragments" through the history of the North, through the desert expansion, and finally, into the black heart of the Cataclysm. Arlo witnessed the raw, unedited record of 202X. He saw the lunar debris, the activation of the five Vessels, and the white-hot flash of the Great Fry that had erased the world. 

He stopped at the edge of the Moon-vision, his eyes wide as he gazed at the fractured pearl in the sky. 

"They were right," he whispered. "The elders. The ones who said the world was only fifty years old. The 'Thousand-Year Fallacy'... it's just a screen."

He turned his attention to me in the vision. He didn't look at my face; he looked at the patterns floating around my ghostly form. He began to decrypt the soul signatures with a speed that made my mind stall. He wasn't leaning on my intuition anymore; he was overriding it. 

"Maya was called Lem," he said, the words heavy and final. he’d identified the overlapping frequencies of my own spirit in the record. 

"Yes," I said. "I am Wood. You are Water."

Arlo didn't answer. He pushed further into the archive, following the line of my deployments. He saw the fire cities, the white forest, the destruction of the snakes. But as he reached the moment of my capture by Anton Drexler—the point where the electrostatic stasis field had engaged—the record hit a wall. 

It was a total, absolute void. A missing decade in my self-knowledge. 

Arlo reached out to touch the black wall, his fingers glowing with a brilliant blue light. I felt a sudden, sharp pressure in the back of my mind—a command-signal so powerful it surpassed anything Novak or Lynn had ever used. 

"Enough," Arlo said. 

Before I could react, he exerted a burst of spiritual will that snapped the vision closed. The dreamscape didn't just fade; it collapsed into a single, blinding point of blue light. 

I gasped, my vision fracturing into static as the physical world returned. 

The camp was silent. The blue flame of the stove was the only light. Arlo ripped the helmet off and set it on the table with a dull, heavy clang. He sat there in total silence, his face unreadable, his eyes fixed on the shadows beyond the fire. 

The Crew watched him, their hands on their rifles, waiting for a reaction that did not come. 

I looked at my hands. They were shaking. I’d seen Arlo master the interface in minutes—a feat that should have taken months of conditioning. He wasn't just a leader anymore. He was a Vessel reclaiming its throne. 

And as the silence stretched across the clearing, I realized that the man who had just seen the truth of 202X was no longer the Arlo I’d come to find.
