# Chapter 12: The Pyramid

The ride to the center was a nightmare of shifting rock and screaming metal. The Moon wasn't just breaking; it was unraveling. Huge slabs of the surface were tilting upward like the teeth of a giant, and I had to fight the hover-bike every second just to stay upright. Beside me, the few bikers who were left looked like ghosts, their silver suits blurred by the clouds of white dust and the constant, blinding flashes of static in the sky. We weren't a strike team anymore; we were just survivors trying to find a piece of ground that wasn't moving.

Then we saw it. 

The pyramid was a jagged, obsidian tooth jutting out of the ruin. It was blacker than the space around it, its edges so sharp they seemed to cut the very light. As I crossed the perimeter, everything changed. One second, the bike was vibrating so hard I thought my teeth would fall out; the next, the world went dead silent.

It was like stepping behind a thick glass wall. Outside, I could see the Moon tearing itself apart in a mute, violent explosion. Inside, there was no wind, no dust, no sound. My ears popped, and the heavy, crushing pressure behind my eyes finally began to ebb.

"Dismount," Novak ordered. Her voice was steady, but I could see the way her hands were shaking as she unclipped her holster. "Look at the perimeter. This is the only place left on this rock that isn't shaking itself to pieces."

We stood in the entry hall, a space so big it could have held a cathedral. The walls were made of that same black stone, covered in lines of faint, pulsing blue light that looked like veins. The soldiers moved in a tight circle, their rifles sweeping the shadows. The air in here felt... thick. Like walking through water.

"Seal the door," Novak commanded, her voice echoing in the vast, empty space.

We were just starting to move toward the inner corridor when the main door—a massive, three-foot-thick sheet of alloy—suddenly shuddered. 

It wasn't a bang. It was a series of heavy, rhythmic thuds that made the whole floor vibrate. I watched in horror as the center of the door began to bulge inward, the metal groaning and popping like it was being hit by a wrecking ball. Then, with a sound like a thunderclap, the hinge snapped and the entire door was blown off its tracks, skidding across the obsidian floor.

General Tor walked in through the dust.

He should have been dead. I’d seen the *Hermes* explode; I’d seen the fire. But there he was, standing in the opening like he’d just walked through a light rain. His armor was blackened and fused, half of his face was a map of raw, red burns, and his tactical visor was nothing but a spiderweb of cracked glass. But his eyes... they were as cold and steady as the day I’d met him.

"Seal it," Tor said. His voice was a low, mechanical rasp that didn't need a radio to be heard. 

Novak took a step back, her rifle half-raised. "General? How... we saw the ship go down. We saw the breach."

"Seal the door, Commander," Tor said, not even looking at her. He was staring down the dark throat of the corridor, his hand resting on the hilt of a heavy, blackened sword. "Now."

The soldiers scrambled to obey, pulling the manual overrides and slamming the emergency barriers into place. The breach was closed, but the fear in the room didn't go away. It just got heavier.

"We’ve got the base, General," Novak said, her voice tight. "The objective is right down that hall. We disable the core, and this is over. Rahu is gone. He has to be."

Tor finally looked at her. "You're wrong, Iris. He's not gone. He's just stopped running."

He adjusted his grip on the sword, the metal clicking against his burnt gauntlet. "He's waiting in the center. He's been waiting for us to find him since the moment we touched the Moon."

The silence that followed was worse than the screaming outside. I watched the soldiers. They’d given everything—their friends, their ships, their own lives—for a victory that Tor was now telling them was a lie. They were exhausted, broken, and now they were being told the monster was still alive.

Novak stared at him. I could see her mind working, trying to find a hole in his logic, a reason why he was wrong. But she looked at the burns on his face and the way his hand didn't shake, and she knew.

"Get ready," Tor said, his voice echoing off the obsidian walls. "We aren't here to push buttons anymore. We're here to finish what was started a thousand years ago."

I checked my magazine. I felt the familiar weight of the hyper-observance settle over me—counting the soldiers, timing the breaths, mapping the shadows. The mission wasn't a game of strategy anymore. It was a funeral march, and we were all walking toward the pyre.
