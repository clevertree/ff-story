# Chapter 78: The Liquid Ghost

The Monoliths didn't just collapse. They dissolved. 

We watched in terrified awe as the blackened, smoking carcasses of the fallen giants began to ripple. Under the sustained heat of the Core’s ancient cannons, the high-density sync-metal had reached its transition point. It wasn't cooling into slag; it was boiling into a liquid, globular stream of silver. 

The fluid metal flicked off the main bodies like droplets of mercury in a storm. But as the droplets hit the sand, they didn't sink. Each piece, some small and some the size of a human, began to reconfigure. 

"Speeder bikes," Jarek whispered. 

They materialized in seconds—unmanned, matte-black, and hovering three feet off the desert floor. They weren't built in a factory; they were grown from the liquid memory of the fallen. 

As soon as a bike was active, it surged. 

The swarm was a thousand strong, a horizontal wave of silver-black needles racing across the sand. The ancient guns tried to track them, but the bikes were too small and too fast. The batteries fired and missed, their shells creating plumes of dust that only further obscured the target. 

Each bike was a kamikaze. They didn't have guns of their own. They didn't need them. They hit the mountain-side batteries with the force of a falling star, detonating their own fluid-metal cores to take the ancient cannons out one by one. 

The Core’s "Ancient Shield" was being dismantled from within. 

The swarm burst through the gun barrier entirely. A small fleet of bikes, maybe a hundred strong, emerged from the smoke and closed the distance to the base in seconds. 

General Tor’s voice was no longer calm. 

"All units, fall back!" he commanded. "Defensive posture at sectors A through D! Consolidate at the entrances! Aim for the silhouettes!"

I looked closer at the footage.

The bikes weren't empty anymore. As they moved through the distortion of the explosions, something was appearing in the seats. It wasn't a physical body, but a shadow—a dark, flickering silhouette with glowing red eyes. 

"Maya," I whispered. 

The silhouette was replicated across every bike in the lead wave. It was a distributed haunting, a single spirit driving a thousand machines with the same vengeful intent. 

On the city broadcast, a spectator screamed over the audio.

"It's Maya! The Witch is here! She's on the bikes!"

The name rippled through the city feeds like a virus. The surveillance cameras all zoomed in, confirming the horrifying, beautiful truth. The dark silhouette of Maya, the entity they had been taught to fear for twenty years, was no longer a ghost in the Moon-base. She was at their gates.
