# Chapter 15: The Utopian Hive

**Title:** The Utopian Hive
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The briefing focused on technical solutions as they explained that the Dead Zone needed to be cleared for the Hive's expansion. Watching the patterns of surveillance on every route, I noted how sensors tracked the movement of every citizen.

Moving in a large group, we deployed the Buoy, causing hostile machines in the area to malfunction from signal interference. Monoliths fired projectiles while the area filled with the smell of ozone and fire.

Following the destruction of my vehicle and a subsequent reset, a unit failure occurred before my system returned and I woke in an incubation chamber. Once our units were repaired and sent back to the field, I watched the city construction continue as citizens began their assigned tasks.

They used the term 'hero' in their reports, the utility of which I understood for encouraging the other workers.

## Revision Notes
- Add a short note describing the Bright Path restart event and incubation time for continuity.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the death/rebirth sequences clinical and short.
- Show city building through mechanical steps rather than dramatic prose.
- Emphasize Lem's growing awareness of the Core's moral economy.

## Synopsis
Briefing on the "Utopian Cities" project and the need for orbital coordination.
