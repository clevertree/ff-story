# Chapter 24: The Acclaim of Success

We cleared the perimeter in six weeks. It cost me five lives. 

Each time I came back, the world felt a little less real. The smell of the desert, the roar of the engines—it all became part of a loop. I’d die in a bloom of fire, walk the White Path for a heart-beat, and then wake up in the blue fluid of the tank. By the fifth time, I didn't even have to be told to go to the hangar. I just walked there, my mind already calculating the intercept angles for the next Monolith.

But we won. The beacons were set, the Disruption Net was active, and the "Wild Synodics" had been driven back into the deep desert. 

The awards ceremony was held in the central plaza of the Desert Base. The air was clean now, filtered by massive atmospheric scrubbers that hummed with a low, satisfying resonance. I stood on a stage made of polished chrome, the sun—the real sun, not the orange glow of the fire—shining down through a gap in the smog.

Cassia was there, her face glowing with pride as she pinned a silver medal to my chest. The **Star of the After Time**. 

"You did it, Lem," she whispered, her eyes bright. She was calling me Lem again. "You saved the mission. You’ve given these people a future."

I looked out at the crowd. There were actual people there—survivors from the refugee camps, wearing clean clothes and carrying real food. They were cheering. They was looking at me like I was a god. And for a second, I believed it. I felt the warmth of the sun on my green skin, the weight of the medal, the taste of synthetic nectar in my glass. It was easy to forget the Moon. It was easy to forget Rahu.

The Archivist Council sat behind us, a row of figures in white robes who watched the crowd with the serene detachment of angels. They spoke of "The Age of No Want" and "The End of Pain." It was a beautiful song, and I wanted to sing along.

But then, as the ceremony ended and I was being led back to my quarters, I saw them.

In a trench at the edge of the plaza, a dozen Gorgons were hauling a massive, glowing city pylon. They weren't building for themselves. They were being driven by a Core authorization key—a silver device held by a soldier who watched them with the same boredom a man might watch a bulldozer. One of the Gorgons stumbled, its thin, metallic legs buckling under the weight. The soldier didn't even look down; he just tapped a button on his remote, and the creature’s whole body spasmed, a shower of orange sparks kicking off its hood.

The Gorgon didn't scream. It just got back up and kept pulling.

I looked at my silver medal. I looked at the clean, smiling faces of the refugees. Then I looked at the slave in the trench. 

The "Utopia" wasn't a gift. It was a trade. And I was the one who had just signed the contract.
