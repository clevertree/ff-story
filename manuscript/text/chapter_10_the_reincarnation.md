**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The reset intensified until the light coming from the pyramid’s center was the only thing I could see clearly. Outside, the sky was changing. Iris Novak looked at her sensors and then up through the translucent sections of the pyramid’s roof. She noted that the Sun appeared to be going out; its strength was dropping rapidly as if the energy was being pulled somewhere else.

On the side of the Earth nearest the moon, major cataclysms were already being recorded. The tectonic plates shifted with enough force to register on the pyramid’s floor, and the atmosphere glowed with the friction of the Lunar resonance. Novak turned her display toward the soldiers. She said the magnetic charge of the moon had changed.

Rahu lay in the center of the hall, held by the stasis field Novak had established. The soldiers around him began to shout as their equipment malfunctioned. They reported that the field was failing. When they tried to use their experimental launchers to stabilize the containment, the beams didn't fire straight; the plasma arced toward the ground and back at the soldiers, forcing them to abandon the heavy weapons.

The stasis field evaporated with a sound like tearing metal. Rahu woke up.

He didn't attack. He ignored us, his frame smoking and his limbs moving with great difficulty. We all watched as he lurched toward the swirling vortex in the center of the pyramid where Lynn had vanished. He fought against the pressure of the reset, his metal body catching on fire from the intensity of the light. Then, just like Lynn, he disintegrated into the vortex.

A few seconds after Rahu was gone, the reset was aborted. The screaming noise of the column died away, and the light collapsed into a single point before vanishing entirely. The vibration in the floor stopped. The moon and the Earth grew calm.

In the sudden silence, Rahu began to reappear. He was reincarnating in the center of the pyramid, his form slowly knitting back together from fragments of light. When the process finished, he fell to the stone floor in a weakened state, his frame charred and motionless.

Iris Novak didn't wait for him to recover. She ordered the soldiers to fire again. This time, the weapons functioned normally. They struck Rahu with a new stasis field, paralyzing him where he lay.

Then she turned and looked directly at me. She gave the order to the soldiers to paralyze me as well. I heard the hum of the launchers charging up, and then the same beams of plasma and electricity hit my frame. I felt the surge of the field locking my joints.

My vision went dark.

## Revision Notes
- Focus on the sensory experience of the reset's failure and the catastrophic scale of the event.
- Maintain Novak's clinical detachment even as the sun appears to fail.
- Describe Rahu's struggle and disintegration as a physical process.
- The paralysis of Lem should be presented as a pragmatic, cold decision by Novak.

## Synopsis
The reset fails after Rahu's disintegration; Rahu is captured again, and Lem is neutralized by Novak.
