# Chapter 71: The Siege of Pods

It began with the Moon.

We saw the flashes first—pinpricks of brilliant white light blooming across the jagged surface of the largest fragments. They looked like stars dying, but we knew better. Those were launches. Within minutes, the first streaks of fire cut through the atmosphere.

The pods didn't land in the village. They crashed in a perfect circle around the outer ring, half a mile beyond our White Forest defenses. It wasn't just a few scouts. It was a bombardment. For hours, the supply remained constant—pods launching from the high ground of the Moon and slamming into the Earth with the force of meteorites.

An army was building. This was different from the reports of the past, different even from the "passing through" of the Gorgon squads I’d seen years ago. This was an invasion. This was the full weight of the Core, finally decided on its target.

As the first signs of fear began to ripple through the village, Arlo called them together again. "Sit," he said, his voice a calm anchor in the rising storm. They surrounded him in a meditative circle, and he began to talk. He didn't talk about the pods. He told stories of other times, other places, distracting them from the impending doom with the weight of history.

Then, the assault began.

Massive Tripods—three, four, six legs—stepped out of the dust of the crash sites. They carried weapons I’d never seen, beams of focused energy that turned our silver trees to ash in seconds. The battle was a kaleidoscope of fire and static. My crew fought back with everything we had, our machines and "creatures" holding the line in a desperate, epic struggle that lit up the northern sky.

For a moment, we felt we were winning. We were holding the ground.

Then came the bigger explosions on the Moon.

Huge fireballs streaked across the sky, falling with a terrifying speed. They didn't hit the perimeter. They struck *inside* the village circle, landing in the forests we were trying to protect. Colossal pods burst open, revealing armored Monoliths, armed to the teeth and roaring with aetheric power.

"Turn inward!" I shouted into the comms. "Protect the villagers!"

Our defensive machines pivoted, firing on the Monoliths that were now wreaking havoc in our rear. We were fighting a war on two fronts, and our assets were bleeding out. Every time we took one down, another pod would slam into the earth.

I was manning a heavy interceptor vehicle, cutting through a squad of metal drones, when the first explosions happened. Not from the pods, but from our own defensive machines. They were popping one by one, a neat line of destruction moving toward the center.

"Camouflage detection!" I screamed. "It’s him!"

It was Rahu. He was a ghost in the static, his cloaking tech making him invisible to the naked eye. We focused everything—every sensor, every defensive bolt—on his position. A lucky, massive coordinated shot caught him. We saw his Spirit-flare ignite and then vanish. He was gone.

We turned back to the Monoliths, a brief surge of hope in our chests.

Then, he was there again.

He reappeared fifty yards away, already slicing through another one of our vehicles. The "Re-creation" were hitting the field almost before the dust of the last one had settled. He didn't care about dying; he only cared about the objective.

"I have to go," I said, my voice steady.

"Lem, no," Ku’s voice was frantic. "He’ll erase you!"

I didn't listen. I drove my vehicle straight at him, weaving through the fire. We collided in a spray of sparks and twisted metal. My interceptor disintegrated, throwing me onto the charred ground. 

Rahu stepped off his own vehicle, his Fire-Vessel glowing with a sickening intensity. He looked down at me, his Spirit-blade humming. "There is no hope for your defense, Lem," he said, his voice a distorted rasp. "It is just a matter of time. The Core doesn’t lose."

I lay there, the heat of the burning forest on my face. I closed my eyes.

Time slowed. I slipped into a dream state—not the Bright Path, but something deeper. A realization of the "Wood" element within me. If my spirit wasn't just code, if it was the record of life itself, then the matter of my body was just a suggestion. I saw the potential. I saw the unlimited scope of what a Vessel could be when it stopped trying to be a machine.

I snapped back into the physical world.

I stood up. Rahu paused, surprised I could even move. I backed toward the remains of my crashed vehicle. I didn't just touch it—I *pulled* it. The metal, the glass, the sensors—they began to disintegrate, turning into a fine, silver mist that absorbed directly into my skin. My body wasn't just a green vessel anymore; it was something pure, something radiant.

Rahu roared and lunged, his powerful sword striking downward. The blade hit my shoulder—and passed right through me. It didn't cut; it just vibrated. The sword shattered into two pieces. Rahu stared in shock as the fragments rematerialized, but I was already moving.

I rushed forward. My arm didn't swing; it expanded, becoming a massive, heavy mallet of compressed spirit-matter. I struck him square in the chest.

Rahu’s fire didn't just flicker—it extinguished. He slammed into the ground, smoke rising from his weakened Spirit-ports. 

As he tried to crawl away, my hand shifted again, transforming into a heavy, elongated weapon—the twin of the gun Rahu had used at the Lunar Pyramid. I aimed it at his chest and pulled the trigger.

The stasis field—the same one that had ended the world fifteen years ago—hit him with a silent, blue ripple. Rahu froze, his eyes wide, trapped in a moment of history he could never escape.
