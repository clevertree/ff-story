# Chapter 63: Cassia's Warning

I waited until the official emissary craft was a speck on the horizon. My mother, Elowen, was in that ship, probably already composing her "Failure of Diplomacy" report for Drexler. She had played the part of the respectful elder, but she hadn't given Arlo the truth. 

I, however, had stayed behind. I had slipped out of the flyer’s sensor-shadow while it was still hovering over the village square, using a small, low-impact hover-pod I had "borrowed" from the Archivist motor-pool. 

I found Arlo on the edge of the village, standing by the banks of the North-Haven stream. He was looking at the water, his face as still as the pool before him. 

"You’re Cassia," he said, not turning around. 

"I'm the one who didn't want to come," I said, stepping off the pod. "The one who thinks my mother is a fool for trying to bargain with a god."

Arlo finally turned, his eyes piercing me with a clarity that made my Hive-Link itch. "I am not a god, Cassia. I am a person who is being hunted by them."

"Then you need to run," I said, my voice sharp with a desperation I couldn't hide. "The offer my mother made... the 'Sovereign Analog Zone'... it was a lie, Arlo. Drexler signed the order for Plan B an hour after the flyer took off."

Arlo’s expression didn't change. "Plan B," he said, the words sounding hollow. "The 'Falling Suns.'"

"Worse," I said. "A Beacon-Pulse. They aren't going to send an army this time. They learned their lesson from Lem and Myrr. They’re going to saturate this entire valley with a high-frequency thermal signal. It will boil the water in your trees. It will stop the hearts of your people. In ten minutes, North-Haven will be a graveyard of white ash."

"Why are you telling me this?" Arlo asked. 

"Because I'm a moderate," I said, and the word felt like a confession. "And moderates are the first ones to be erased by people like Drexler. I don't want to live in a world where the only thing left is a glass city and a silent desert. I want... I want there to be a North."

I reached into the pocket of my linen robe and pulled out a small, metallic chip. It was an Archivist override-key—something I had spent months "preparing" in the Cradle Zero labs. 

"Take this," I said, pressing it into his hand. "It’s a bypass for the Beacon-Network. If you can get it to Lem—to the 'King of the Gorgons'—he might be able to use it to create a shield. It won't stop a Sky-Monolith, but it might buying you enough time to evacuate into the deep mountains."

Arlo looked at the chip, then at me. "If I take this, they will know you gave it to me."

"Let them know," I said. "I’m a Vane. They won't kill me. They’ll just put me in a prettier cage."

"You are a brave woman, Cassia Vane," Arlo said. 

"I'm a terrified one," I corrected him. "Now go. Tell your people to leave. Tell them that the 'Fallacy' is coming for them, and this time, it’s not using words."

I watched him walk away—a young man with the weight of a planet on his shoulders. He didn't run. He just walked, his steps measured and calm. 

I stayed by the stream for a long time, listening to the water and the wind. I knew that by the time I returned to Cradle Zero, the "moderates" would have lost their voice. The Archivists were done with diplomacy. They were done with pluralities. 

The Great Stalemate was over, and as I looked up at the sky, I saw the first of the Sky-Monoliths breaking orbit, their red lenses burning with the fire of a thousand suns.
