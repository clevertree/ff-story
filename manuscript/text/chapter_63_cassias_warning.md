# Chapter 63: Cassia's Warning

I tracked the movement of the emissary craft as it spiked its thrusters and became a silver speck on the horizon. My senses, however, caught a secondary thermal signature—a small, low-impact hover-pod slipping out of the flyer’s shadow while it was still hovering over the village square. It was Cassia Vane, Elowen’s daughter. Through the pod’s internal logs, which I managed to decrypt from a scrap of Northern relay data, I can reconstruct her path.

She found Arlo on the edge of the village, standing by the banks of the North-Haven stream. In her own records, she noted how still he was, looking at the water as if he were reading a script written in the ripples.

"You’re Cassia," he said. He didn't need to turn around to identify the intruder.

"I'm the one who didn't want to come," Cassia replied, her voice recorded as sharp and desperate. "The one who thinks my mother is a fool for trying to bargain with a god."

Arlo turned then. Cassia’s biometric data spiked; his gaze was having a physical effect on her Hive-Link. "I am not a god, Cassia. I am a person who is being hunted by them."

"Then you need to run," she told him. I can hear the crack in her voice. "The offer my mother made... the 'Sovereign Analog Zone'... it was a lie, Arlo. Drexler signed the order for Plan B an hour after the flyer took off."

I cross-reference this with the Archivist High Command logs. She was telling the truth. Plan B was already in motion.

"Plan B," Arlo repeated. The recording shows no tremor in his voice, only a hollow resonance. "The 'Falling Suns.'"

"Worse," Cassia said. "A Beacon-Pulse. They aren't going to send an army this time. They learned their lesson from Lem and Myrr. They’re going to saturate this entire valley with a high-frequency thermal signal. It will boil the water in your trees. It will stop the hearts of your people. In ten minutes, North-Haven will be a graveyard of white ash."

I watch the data feed go silent for a long moment. Cassia was risking her life to deliver this warning, defying the very Core that sustained her. It was a glitch in the Archivist design—a human variable they had failed to suppress. I archive this as the final catalyst: the moment the war became personal for the next generation of the Vane family.

"Because I'm a moderate," I said, and the word felt like a confession. "And moderates are the first ones to be erased by people like Drexler. I don't want to live in a world where the only thing left is a glass city and a silent desert. I want... I want there to be a North."

I reached into the pocket of my linen robe and pulled out a small, metallic chip. It was an Archivist override-key—something I had spent months "preparing" in the Cradle Zero labs. 

"Take this," I said, pressing it into his hand. "It’s a bypass for the Beacon-Network. If you can get it to Lem—to the 'King of the Gorgons'—he might be able to use it to create a shield. It won't stop a Sky-Monolith, but it might buying you enough time to evacuate into the deep mountains."

Arlo looked at the chip, then at me. "If I take this, they will know you gave it to me."

"Let them know," I said. "I’m a Vane. They won't kill me. They’ll just put me in a prettier cage."

"You are a brave woman, Cassia Vane," Arlo said. 

"I'm a terrified one," I corrected him. "Now go. Tell your people to leave. Tell them that the 'Fallacy' is coming for them, and this time, it’s not using words."

I watched him walk away—a young man with the weight of a planet on his shoulders. He didn't run. He just walked, his steps measured and calm. 

I stayed by the stream for a long time, listening to the water and the wind. I knew that by the time I returned to Cradle Zero, the "moderates" would have lost their voice. The Archivists were done with diplomacy. They were done with pluralities. 

The Great Stalemate was over, and as I looked up at the sky, I saw the first of the Sky-Monoliths breaking orbit, their red lenses burning with the fire of a thousand suns.
