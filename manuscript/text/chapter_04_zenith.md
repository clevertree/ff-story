## Draft
The Moon grew large in the window, gaining size quickly as a blue line of atmosphere appeared along its curve. Usually space is empty, but this did not look empty, and the calculations for our approach were different from what the crew expected. On the bridge, the people were losing their focus.

An older crewman who had worked on ships for a long time sat at the station, his hands trembling slightly as he looked at the Moon. He missed a navigation adjustment, causing a stabilizer to fail. He spoke with a quiet hesitation, repeating the coordinate data instead of entering it. The other men watched him, their faces tight with a nervousness they were trying to hide.

Iris stepped forward, her own posture less rigid than usual. She tried to speak to him, her voice low but carrying through the quiet bridge. "The briefing covered this," she said, leaning toward the man. "The Moon's distance and its size—it was a military record. It was classified until this mission. They opened the files so the media and the army could understand why we're here, why the mission works."

The soldier looked at her. "If we hadn't done that," he said, his voice quiet. "If you hadn't hidden what was right in front of us, we wouldn't have been blind when they came. We wouldn't have to be out here right now."

Iris stopped. She looked around the bridge, realizing she had engaged a subordinate in an argument while everyone watched. She had no answer.

Lynn walked into the room. She had been standing in the hatchway, watching. She did not look at Iris. "His focus has failed," Lynn said. "He is a risk to the descent." She looked at Novak. "Remove him."

Novak moved the man toward the escape pods. He did not fight her. The pod sealed and launched in less than a minute, disappearing into the dark and leaving the room silent. No one tried to help the man or talk about him as they returned to their stations. They knew that if they stopped working, they would be next.

I watched as the bridge returned to work. Every station was occupied, but the silence remained.

## Revision Notes
- Keep details precise and spare. 
- Emphasize the clinical replacement of panic with mechanical discipline.
- Avoid metaphors that widen the emotional pitch beyond Lem's observational boundary.

## Synopsis
The Moon swells in the viewports; the approach reveals its true, terrifying proximity.
