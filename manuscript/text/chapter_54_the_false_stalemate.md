# Chapter 68: The False Stalemate

The airlock hissed as I re-entered the White Forest ship, the residual heat from the Fire City still radiating from my skin. Myrr and the others were waiting, their faces tense with a mix of anxiety and desperate hope.

I told them everything. The Gorgon’s humanoid self-image, the hyper-efficient language of hissing consonants, and the final, cold rejection of the Core’s peace deal.

"They won't turn off the fires," I said, leaning against the navigation console. "They've accepted a stalemate, but they won't accept the peace plan. They don't trust the Core."

Myrr looked at me, her eyes weary. "Why? What did they say?"

"They said the same thing Arlo told us," I replied, the realization still cold in my chest. "They refuse the Core for the same reason the villages do. To unify with them isn't peace; it's consumption. They know that if they lower their shields, the Core won't build a garden. They'll build a factory. They’ll dismantle their minds just like they dismantle the wilderness."

I paused, looking at Jarek and Myrr. "And they pointed out something I should have seen. The Core couldn't free them even if they wanted to. Every Hive City, every 'paradise' the humans live in, is built on Gorgon labor. If the Core granted them freedom, the cities would collapse in a day. To make a peace deal work, the Core would have to enslave them even deeper into the walls themselves."

Myrr nodded slowly. "And the village? Did they say they'd stop the attacks?"

"No," I said quietly. "In fact, when I asked how we could save it, he told me to destroy every Gorgon that touches the soil."

The crew wasn't surprised. In the North, they knew that trust was something the Core had liquidated years ago. 

"We did our part," Myrr said, her voice hard. "Now let's see if Iris keeps hers."

We began our ascent, the ship’s engines roaring as we pushed through the obsidian clouds. Once we reached a safer altitude, Jarek—the other Jarek, our comms tech—initiated a long-wave transmission. We sent the signal directly to Cradle Zero, addressed to Iris Novak.

*The signal has been sent,* we messaged. *The Gorgons have accepted your truce, but not your peace deal. They won't turn the fires off. We have done our part. Release our comrade.*

I even attached a redacted transcription of the Gorgon’s thoughts—the parts that didn't reveal their internal self-image or the mention of the Sun. It was a token of transparency, a price paid for a life.

A short wait followed, the silence in the cockpit thick enough to choke on. Then, a voice cracked over the comm.

"Lem. This is Iris." She sounded tired, the weight of the Core's politics audible in her breathing. "I have received the transmission. I am sorry the deal was not accepted in full, but the Council has seen the data. I am releasing Jarek at the following coordinates outside the desert perimeter."

We followed the trail, reaching a small, disabled transport docked in the parched dunes a few miles from the city walls. We found Jarek inside—safe, though his eyes were wide with the shock of a week spent in an Archivist lab. 

He told us they had interrogated him for days. They wanted to know everything about me, about Rahu, about the "Witch" Maya and the original Lynn. He had told them everything he knew—which, thankfully, wasn't much. He hadn't known the location of our wilderness encampment, and he took a grim pride in telling them they would never find it.

"I told them they’d never penetrate our base even if they did," he whispered as we hauled him back onto our ship.

We prepared to leave, the hover-drives humming with the promise of a quiet return to the North. We had accomplished what we could. It was time to find a new place to rebuild, a base of our own.

But before we could bank the ship toward the horizon, Jarek—the comms tech—held up a hand. 

"Wait. I'm picking up a new broadcast from the city."

We all stared at the main screen. A news anchor, her face a mask of professional concern, was speaking.

"The investigation into the recent terrorist incursions has successfully concluded," she said. "We have identified the source of the hostilities that have plagued our Hive Cities."

We watched in shock. We had just brokered a stalemate. I had just spoken with Iris.

"Surveillance intel from the Strategic Sanction division confirms that the terrorists are originating from the Northern Village settlements," the anchor continued. "The leaders of these villages, particularly the one known as Arlo, have been identified as the leader of the Maya cult. They seek to preserve a cultish, secretive tradition at the expense of global peace."

The screen showed a high-resolution surveillance photo of Arlo’s village. The same village where I had spent years.

"They are twisting the story again," Jarek hissed. "They aren't tracing us to the White Forest. They're tracing us to Arlo."

I stared at the grainy image of the village square. It was the ultimate lie. The villagers had refused all technology, following an indigenous religion that had nothing to do with witchcraft or the "Witch" Maya. They knew the stories of Maya, of course, but they felt no connection to her. To them, she was just another ghost from the world that died.

The irony was bitter. Arlo and his people didn't practice witchcraft—they believed that *digital* technology was the true witchcraft. They taught that even in the ancient past, the world's software and hardware were built with "witch spells"—backdoors, remote access, and broken encryption that allowed for stolen assets, assumed identities, and false accusations. In their eyes, it was those invisible spells that had eventually caused the death of the world. Now, the Core was using those same invisible tools to frame them for the very "magic" they loathed.

I looked at the screen, the festive lights of Cradle Zero's paradise flickering in the background. The stalemate was a lie. Or worse—Iris had been used. She had kept us busy in the Fire Cities while the Core prepared the narrative for Plan B. 

The Core was no longer united. And we had just handed them the justification they needed to burn the North to the ground.
