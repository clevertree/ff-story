# Chapter 70: The Narrative Trap

The defenses were ready in a matter of hours. The White Forest crew worked with a desperate, focused energy, planting the silver-veined trees and positioning the defensive machines in a tight, overlapping web. When the last beacon was set and the last tripod was anchored, there was nothing left to do but wait.

The villagers watched us from the edges of their homes. They were grateful, I think—they saw the silver shields we had raised for them—but the distrust was still thick enough to touch. They asked my crew to stay on the outskirts. Only I was allowed to cross the invisible line into the heart of the village.

By the time I reached the square again, Arlo’s sermon was concluding. The air seemed to settle, the tension bleeding out of the crowd. They didn't look like people awaiting an execution; they looked content. They began to return to their routines—tending to the animals, preparing the evening meal—as if the world wasn't about to end. Arlo had convinced them that worrying was a waste of the spirit, a distraction from a reality they couldn't control.

"You can't just let them sit here," a voice said behind me.

I turned. It was Cassia. She looked almost unrecognizable. She had stripped away her Archivist robes and her sleek comm-links, replaced them with the heavy, hand-woven wool of the villagers. Her youthful naivety, that bright spark I’d seen back in the Hive Cities, had been shattered. In its place was a cynical, hollowed-out exhaustion.

"I met them, Lem," she whispered, her eyes fixed on the distant horizon. "I met Anton. I met the ones who decide which cities live and which ones are recycled. I thought they were just... misguided. But they aren't. They will stop at nothing to get the exact outcome they want here. They don't want to save humanity. They want to curate it."

She walked toward the center of the square, where Arlo was standing. 

"Arlo, please," Cassia pleaded, her voice cracking. "We have to evacuate them. At least the children. Take them into the deep woods. Your religion... your record... it needs to survive."

Arlo looked at her with a calm, almost pitying detachment. "You are still trying to move the pieces, Cassia. You are still thinking like a player on their board. You must learn to remove yourself from the equation. Detach. For your own benefit, not theirs."

I stepped forward. "Arlo, we have tripods on the perimeter. We’re tracking the orbital shifts. We need to coordinate—"

"I am happy you are here, Lem," Arlo interrupted, smiling gently. He wasn't listening to the strategy. He wasn't interested in the deployment map. He was just present.

The attack we expected didn't come that night. Or the next. We monitored the city transmissions, searching for a sign of the Core's movement. The villagers began to grow grumpy; they didn't like the silver trees and the humming machines cluttering their paths. They wanted the weapons removed, the world restored to its "natural" state.

But we knew why the Core was waiting. 

"They’re working us into the script," Ku said, staring at a flickering holographic broadcast.

It started on every screen in the Hive Cities. My face, and the faces of every member of the White Forest team, were broadcast in high-definition. We weren't "Vessels" anymore. We were "Terrorists." The media listed our stats, our designations, and a long list of crimes: sabotaging the power grid, causing "casualties" during an assault that had never happened. They were building a narrative of "Digital Witchcraft" and "Terrorist Insurgency."

The broadcast depicted our defense not as a shield for the villagers, but as a "Gorgon-handler containment zone." They told the citizens of the Hive that we were the ones bringing the Gorgons—that we were the source of the witchcraft. They showed images of the village and claimed the "terrorist cells" were fighting among themselves, that the human traitors were rebelling against their Gorgon masters.

"There may be no forgiveness for their crimes," the smooth, synthetic voice of the news anchor said. "And yet, our Utopian Society is just. If the traitors surrender themselves now, if they abandon their handlers, they will be given passage back to the light."

I felt a tremor of doubt ripple through the crew. For the first time, I saw men and women looking at the silver towers on the horizon and wondering if it was true. If they could really go home.

"It’s a lie," I said, my voice cutting through the silence. "They want the data back. They want the Vessels back. There is no home for us there. Not anymore."

But as I looked at the shimmering moon fragments above, I knew the Core wasn't finished with the script. They were just waiting for the curtain to rise.
