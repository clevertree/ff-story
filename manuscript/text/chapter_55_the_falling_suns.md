# Chapter 55: The Falling Suns

The valley was a sea of moving wood and silent eyes. 

My army was miles into the plain, a slow-moving forest of Monoliths and Striders that looked unstoppable. I sat in a command-carrier on the ridge, my Aether-Drive processing the data-streams from a thousand different units at once. We were five miles from the outer perimeter of Cradle Zero. 

Then my sensors picked up the signal. 

It didn't come from the Desert Base. It came from the sky. 

I looked up, my wood-vessel eyes zooming in on the deep purple of the atmosphere. High above, a line of brilliant, white sparks had appeared, cutting through the smog like a shower of falling stars. Within seconds, the sparks flared into mini-suns, growing larger and brighter as they plunged toward the desert floor. 

"They’re launching from the Moon," I whispered, the realization hitting me like a physical punch. 

"Lunar pods?" Myrr asked, his hand gripping the edge of the console. 

"They're too big," I said. "And too fast."

The impacts were world-shaking. The pods didn't land; they struck, hitting the sand with the force of small meteorites. One of them landed directly in the center of our third line, vaporizing ten Monoliths in a thermal plume of white-hot plasma that reached the clouds. 

As the dust settled, the pods began to unfold. 

It wasn't a mechanical opening; it was a "birth." The metal of the pods warped and expanded, blooming into the shapes of the original **Sky-Monoliths**. These were much larger than the "Builders" that had landed in the suburbs in 202X. They were brimming with Fire-aligned weaponry, their hulls a gleaming, high-density metal that reflected the orange desert sun with a terrifying, mirror-like clarity. 

They performed their system checks in a fraction of a second, their single, red lenses flaring with a light that I felt in the depths of my own Aether-Drive. 

Then came the fire. 

The engagement was a clash of symmetric technologies. My Wood-Water army met the Core’s Fire-Metal giants in a landscape of plasma fire and splintered wood. My Striders opened fire with their wood-blueprinted cannons, their blue pulses hitting the Sky-Monoliths' armor with a sound like a hammer striking an anvil. 

But the Core’s response was brutal. The Sky-Monoliths didn't just fire back; they carved. Their invisible heat-rays sliced through my army with a clinical efficiency, turning my high-density "trees" into towers of burning plasma. 

I remote-controlled the force with every ounce of my processing power, attempting to find a gap in the Core’s line. But it was like fighting a mountain. For every Sky-Monolith we managed to disable, two more would "fall" from the sky, their pods striking the sand with a terrifying, rhythmic predictability. 

"We’re holding the line," Myrr said, his eyes fixed on the battle-map. "But we’re not pushing through."

He was right. The plain had become a stalemate of raw, unmanaged energy. The Wood/Water technology was resilient—my machines were rebuilding themselves from the shattered fragments of their fallen comrades even as the battle raged—but they couldn't overcome the sheer thermal output of the Fire-aligned giants. 

Drexler was willing to risk meteorites to protect his home. 

"If we stay here, we’re just a distraction," I said, my voice crackling with static. "This is exactly what he wants. He’s draining our arsenal in a symmetric war that will never reach his door."

I looked at the Sky-Monoliths—gleaming, perfect, and unblinking. They were the "liberators" of the Moon, the apex predators of the Core’s hierarchy. And as the valley filled with the smell of ozone and burning wood, I realized that my army wasn't an invader anymore. 

It was a forest in the path of a sun.
