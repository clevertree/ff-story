## Draft
Months after the first city fell, the monoliths finally reached the suburbs. The morning was characterized by the same sequence of ordinary household sounds, but the news bulletins had reached a terminal frequency. The sky was no longer ordinary; the atmosphere hummed with the residual charge of recent plasma strikes.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I did not panic. I observed. The neighborhood children were playing a game they called "Tripod," mimicking the heavy, loping gait of the machines they saw on the news. They seemed detached, entertaining deep-state whistleblower theories about mysterious figures like Rahu to cope with the fear. I recorded their laughter as a discordant note against the sirens.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths on the horizon when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing. I did not move.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position. She approached me with a gait that suggested a high degree of technical authority. Her eyes lacked the shared panic of the neighborhood; her posture was perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds before speaking. "Lem," she said. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn't remember where I'd heard it.

I watched her, wondering what she would do next.

When she saw that I wouldn't comply, she struck me once. My world went dark as I passed out.

I was in the Aether-space for the first time. It wasn't a room, and it wasn't a dream. I knew where I was, even if I couldn't name it then. Lynn was there.

She told me I was not human. She explained that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she required my cooperation. I believed her. There was no reason not to.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. I woke up on the floor of my living room. I couldn't move my arms or legs, but I stood up anyway. I walked out the front door, though I wasn't the one making the choice. It felt like something was at the base of my brain, pulling at my muscles like I was a puppet. I was just a passenger in my own body.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

We arrived at a military base an hour later, where a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.

## Synopsis
News of lunar plasma discharges reaches a crescendo as the Monoliths move into Lem's city. Lynn's sudden arrival shifts the global perspective. Lem is forcefully recruited into a mission that reveals the existence of aether-space and his own non-human nature, marking the end of his ordinary life.

## Outline
- Monoliths become visible on the horizon; evacuations begin.
- Military arrives at Lem's house; he watches, detached.
- Lynn appears, exercises authority, and claims prior ties to Lem.
- She attempts to activate his Aether-Drive; Lem resists and is struck unconscious.
- Lem is pulled into an Aether-space in which Lynn explains his nature.
- Lem is remote-controlled as a "passenger" in his own body and boards the spacecraft.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's simple, person-next-door voice.
- Use a grounded, direct tone—brief declarative sentences, no robot-speak or jargon.
- Emphasize the details of the "passenger" effect—the horror of being an observer in one's own body.
- No domestic sentimentalism; focus on the observation of the environment.
