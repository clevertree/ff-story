# Chapter 30: The White Forest Briefing

The transition was a violent surge of cold electricity. One moment I was a cloud of wood-splinters in a northern clearing, and the next, I was a solid weight falling onto the cold floor of a retrieval capsule. The hiss of depressurizing gas filled the room, sounding like a thousand distant whispers.

I gasped, my new lungs burning with the dry, recycled air of the desert base. The sensation of the remote detonation was still a raw, phantom ache in my consciousness—a ghost of the signal that had just ended my previous life. 

I climbed out of the capsule, my wood-vessel body feeling heavy and unfamiliar, as if the Core had built me slightly denser this time to prevent another "hesitation." The lab was silent, clinical, and devoid of any mention of Mission 3. In the eyes of the Archivists, the North was a closed file, the "anomaly" successfully erased.

Cassia Vane was waiting for me. She didn't look like a scientist today. She was wearing tactical gear—slick, black polycarbonate plates over a mesh suit. She looked like she was going into battle.

"The North was a mess, Lem," she said, her voice low. There was a flicker of something in her eyes—guilt, perhaps, or a warning she couldn't speak. "Novak is furious about the 'wild' tech sightings. She thinks there’s a network we’ve missed."

"There is," I said, wiping the blue fluid from my eyes. "They were planting things, Cassia. Not just machines. Memories."

She paused, her hand hovering over a data-pad. "That’s why you’re going back in. But this time, you’re not a 'face' for the humans. You’re the commander."

She tapped the pad, and a map of the **White Forest**—the deepest, most inaccessible part of the Arctic zone—projected into the air. "We’ve detected a massive, analog signal coming from the center of this sector. It’s a dead zone for our builders. We can't even see it from orbit. There’s something there that's... erasing us."

"And you want me to find it?"

"I want you to lead the infiltration. You’ve seen how they think, Lem. You’ve touched the roots." she looked at me, and for a second, I saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "Novak wanted to send Rahu. I told her he’d just burn it all down. We need whatever is at the center of that forest. If it's a way to mask signals, we need it for the next phase of the Hive."

She handed me a tactical interface—a wrist-slung projector that hummed with a sharp, green light. "You have tactical control over the Support Units. All of them. Use them however you need to get to the center."

I looked at the map. The White Forest was a blank space, a circle of pure white where no data existed. 

"And if Arlo is there?" I asked.

Cassia didn't look at me. She just turned toward the door. "Then he’s part of the anomaly, Lem. And anomalies don't get to have names."

I looked at the green interface on my wrist. It felt like a cuff. I was being given the power to destroy the only people who still remembered what a "human" was. 

"I won't burn it," I whispered.

But as I walked toward the hangar, my Aether-Drive pulsed with a new directive, one that didn't come from Novak or Cassia. 

*Flee. The White Forest is not a place. It is a mirror.*
