# Chapter 1: The Alien Moon Base

## Draft
These are my memories. I’m starting from the first thing I can remember and taking it through the five missions I was part of, up to the moment I send this transmission. I’ve tried to stick to the facts and keep my own opinions out of it. I’ve also included everything we recovered from the Before Time and the Core Technocracy, including the history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—what the Archive Transcripts call the Base Alpha activation. I want people to know the truth so these mistakes aren’t repeated.

I remember my childhood as a series of routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of the orphanage. I didn’t have a family, so my days were all about timetables. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a beginning.

The shift began slowly, with amateur radio leaks. They spoke of an "Alien Moon Base" on the far side, hidden from Earth’s view. At first, it was just something for people on late-night forums to obsess over, parsing grainy telescope footage. But over the years, it became a global phenomenon that split the world. Half the people I knew thought it was some elaborate hoax or a deep-state plot to raise taxes. The other half just drew their curtains and waited for a signal that never seemed to come.

Life stayed pretty normal for a long time, but the mood changed. Radios were left on constantly, tuned to emergency frequencies just in case. Neighbors stopped talking about the weather and started watching the sky with a specific, quiet dread.

The first city fell three years after the leaks started. It was a major coastal hub, wiped out in a single afternoon by stadium-sized machines that looked like thin, elongated apes. The footage was everywhere—monoliths with arms so long they reached the ground, moving with a terrifying, heavy grace.

National borders dissolved within forty-eight hours. Every military in the world unified immediately; generals who had been enemies since the last century were suddenly sharing satellite feeds and data. We were preparing for a war against an invader we didn't understand.

Panic hit the highest levels of command when the "aliens" revealed their strategy. The ultimatum was broadcast on every channel: humanity could allow the monoliths to dismantle the power grids and accept a new technocratic order, or face total atmospheric destruction. There was no middle ground, and no defense against the plasma that could turn a capital city into a lake of glass in seconds.

In the months that followed, the moon began to fire back. Plasma discharges—silent, blinding flashes in the upper atmosphere—would be followed by the news that another city had been destroyed. My neighborhood became a practice in waiting. We followed the news like it was the only thing that mattered, watching the front line crawl across the map toward us. The news had stopped being neutral.

## Synopsis
The discovery of the Alien Moon Base through amateur signal leaks transforms from a fringe curiosity into a global phenomenon. Over several years, society fractures between believers and skeptics until the first monolith attack on a major city triggers a world-wide military unification and a desperate, months-long defense against lunar plasma discharges.
