# Chapter 1: The Alien Moon Base

## Draft
The contents of this broadcast represent a full record of my memory, starting from the first moment I can remember, covering the five missions I was part of, and ending with the transmission of this packet. I have kept my own opinions out of the record; I want to provide a factual account. Also included is a complete record of everything recovered from the Before Time and Core Technocracy, including an accurate record of human history leading up to the Moon Cataclysm—which the Archive Transcripts refer to as the Base Alpha activation—so that these mistakes can be avoided in the future.

I recall a childhood defined by repeatable routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of institutional care. I was an orphan; my days were governed by timetables rather than family memory. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a before.

The shift began not with a bang, but with a series of amateur radio leaks. They spoke of an "Alien Moon Base" on the far side, hidden from Earth’s view. At first, it was a fringe obsession, a topic for late-night forums and subscribers who parsed every pixel of grainy telescope footage. Over the years, it became a global phenomenon that split the world. Half the people I knew dismissed it as a elaborate psyop or a deep-state hoax designed to unify global taxes. The other half drew their curtains and waited for a signal that never seemed to come.

Life remained superficially ordinary for a long time, but the tenor of the day changed. Radios were left on constantly, tuned to emergency frequencies just in case. Neighbors stopped talking about the weather and started watching the sky with a specific, quiet dread.

The first city fell three years after the leaks began. It was a major coastal hub, wiped out in a single afternoon by stadium-sized machines that loped like thin, elongated apes. The footage was everywhere—monoliths with forearms that reached the ground, moving with a terrifying, heavy grace. 

National sovereignty dissolved within forty-eight hours. The global military unification was immediate; generals who had been enemies since the last century were suddenly sharing satellite feeds and coordinate data. We were preparing for a war against an invader we didn't understand.

In the months that followed, the moon began to fire back. Plasma discharges—silent, blinding flashes in the upper atmosphere—would be followed by the news that another city had been turned to glass. My neighborhood became a practice in waiting. We followed the news as if it were a liturgy, watching the front line crawl across the map toward us. The news had ceased to be neutral.

## Synopsis
The discovery of the Alien Moon Base through amateur signal leaks transforms from a fringe curiosity into a global phenomenon. Over several years, society fractures between believers and skeptics until the first monolith attack on a major city triggers a world-wide military unification and a desperate, months-long defense against lunar plasma discharges.
