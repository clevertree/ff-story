# Chapter 8: The Shattered Approach

General Tor’s voice didn’t come through the speakers; it seemed to come from the very metal of the ship. It was a deep, resonant rumble that made the deckplates under my boots vibrate. It wasn't the voice of a man—it was the voice of a statue, heavy and unmoving, yet somehow deeply comforting.

"You are the vanguard," the voice said, the sound so clear it felt like he was standing right behind us. "The truth has been hidden for a thousand years, but today, we pull back the curtain. Stay steady. Stay focused. For Earth."

I watched the soldiers. They didn't just stand straighter; they seemed to lock into place like parts of a rifle. The dread that had been eating them alive for days was gone, replaced by a simple, grim purpose. Tor hadn't just given them a speech; he’d given them a reason to die. It was a terrifying thing to watch—how easily a man’s mind could be reset by a frequency of absolute certainty.

For three days, the Moon hadn't been a rock anymore. It was an engine. Huge, pale-blue spirals of light—plasma, the scientists called it—were erupting from the poles, arching thousands of miles into the black. They looked like glowing bridges, silent and beautiful and wrong. They were stitching the sky together, and as we watched them through the thick, leaded glass of the observation deck, nobody said a word.

Then, the world ended.

It started with a low-frequency hum that I felt in my teeth before I heard it. Then, a heat bloom. Not the warm sun, but a searing, white-hot glow coming from deep inside the lunar craters. The electronics on the bridge didn't just beep; they screamed. A frantic, high-pitched electronic wailing that sounded like birds trapped in a cage.

The lunar surface didn't just crack. It tore.

I stood at the viewport, my hands pressed against the glass, watching as a piece of the Mare Imbrium—a plain larger than some countries—simply lifted away from the sphere. It didn't fall. It drifted upward, spinning slowly, surrounded by rings of white dust that looked like frozen smoke. The Moon wasn't breaking; it was peeling.

"The field is too high!" a technician yelled, his voice cracking with a sound of pure, helpless terror. "Gravity shouldn't... the rock shouldn't move like that! Physics doesn't work this way!"

He was right. The books we’d read in school, the maps we’d studied, the very laws of the universe we’d been told were absolute—they were all burning up in the glare. The Moon wasn't a satellite. It was a shell. And whatever was inside it was waking up.

"Scatter!" the order came from the *Hermes*, Tor’s flagship. I could see it ahead of us, a silver needle against the white chaos. "All vessels, fire maneuvering thrusters! Break formation!"

The *Caucasian Eagle* groaned, the sound of the chemical rockets igniting a deep, bone-shaking roar. We were fast, but the debris field was an impossible maze. The first hit wasn't a sound. It was a shockwave that slammed me into the bulkhead, knocking the wind out of me. A shard of moon-rock the size of a tank had sheared through the sensor array, sending a spray of orange sparks across the viewport.

Then came the second hit.

It was the sound of a giant's hand crushing a tin can. The ship’s frame, the best human engineering could build, simply gave up. The bridge tilted forty-five degrees. The gravity failed, and for a terrifying second, I was floating in a cabin filled with loose screws and screaming men. Then the gravity slammed back on, pinning us to the floor at a sickening angle.

The alarms weren't distinct anymore. They were just one long, continuous scream of metal on metal.

We were spinning. Through the viewport, the Moon was a white blur, expanding until it was the only thing I could see. I felt a sudden, freezing tug on my skin—a hull breach. The air was being sucked out, whistling through a crack somewhere behind the console.

The *Caucasian Eagle* was a dead thing now. A falling lead weight, pulled by a gravity that shouldn't exist. We were alone. The *Hermes* was gone, swallowed by the cloud of white dust. The last thing I felt before the light went out was the Aether-Drive behind my eyes, suddenly heavy, pulling at me like a tether as we plummeted toward the bone-white desert below.
