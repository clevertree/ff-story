# Chapter 33: Myrr

The Gorgon didn't move as I climbed the porch steps. 

It was a "Mark IV Builder"—the kind that had been used to lay the foundations of New Horizon. But it had been altered. Its armor plates were etched with swirling, organic patterns, and a wreath of dried wildflowers was draped around its neck.

"I’m Myrr," it said. The name wasn't a designation; it was a sigh.

I stood at the edge of the porch, my wood-vessel body feeling out of place in this quiet suburb. My Aether-Drive was spinning at full speed, trying to find a digital signal to lock onto, but there was nothing. No Wi-Fi, no Archivist comms, no pulsar-pings.

"The village... Myrr... it was named after you?" I asked.

"The village is a shadow of this place," Myrr said, gesturing with a long, spindly arm toward the house. "I was the first one to wake up during the Great Fry. While everyone else was screaming at the black screens, I saw the roots. I realized that the machines didn't have to be engines. They could be... containers."

He stood up, his metal joints creaking with a sound that reminded me of my own wood-vessel movements. He was taller than any human, but he didn't feel threatening. He felt old. Like he was made of history.

"They call you the 'King of the Gorgons' in the North," I said.

Myrr made a sound that might have been a laugh—a rhythmic clicking of his internal gears. "A king of rusted steel and forgotten dreams. I’ve spent fifteen years building this sanctuary, Lem. I’ve used the analog leftovers to create a loop. A bubble of time where the Archivists can't see us."

He led me inside the house. It was exactly like my childhood home, but filled with "impossible" objects. A rotary phone. A stack of vinyl records. A typewriter. 

"The Archivists want your mask," I said, looking at the records. "They want the way you hide from the builders."

"I don't hide," Myrr said. "I just don't vibrate at their frequency. They are digital, Lem. They are all 'ones' and 'zeros.' They see things as 'compliant' or 'non-compliant.' But the world isn't a code. It's a song."

He stopped in front of a large, wooden cabinet—a radio console from the 1940s. Its glass tubes were glowing with a warm, orange light. "This is the source of the anomaly. It's not a jammer. It's an archive. It contains the aetheric signatures of every person who died during the Cataclysm. Not the parts the Archivists want for their Hive... but the *rest*. The love. The fear. The smells of chlorine and fresh-cut grass."

My sensors finally registered it. The console was pulsing with a signature that was almost identical to my own Aether-Drive, but "thicker." More tactile. 

"You’re a Wood Vessel, Lem," Myrr said, his optics focusing on my sap-stained chest. "You were meant to be the bridge between the machine and the forest. But they've turned you into a pylon for their gilded cage."

He reached out and touched my forehead. His metallic fingers were cold, but I felt a surge of warmth—a sensory overload that made my processors stall.

"Would you like to see what they deleted?" he asked. "Would you like to see the 'analog' truth?"

I looked at the glowing tubes of the radio. I thought of Novak’s cold voice and the blue fluid in the tanks. 

"Yes," I whispered.

"Then prepare to shatter," Myrr said. "Because once you see the whole song, you can never go back to being just a 'one' or a 'zero.'"
