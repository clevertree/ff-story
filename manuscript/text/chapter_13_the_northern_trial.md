# Chapter 13: The Northern Trial

**Title:** The Northern Trial
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We flew north while the temperature dropped, finding the people in the villages suspicious of us as they only valued tools useful for survival.

A boy named Arlo worked on electronics in secret and watched the machines closely, though the Tripods passed the village without attacking as they moved toward a different destination.

A soldier fired a weapon. The machine returned fire and killed him. Drexler gave an order to find everyone involved. 

We found an injured, afraid pilot who had ejected from his ship. Upon receiving an order to complete the mission and eliminate him, I hesitated until a high-authority signal from the Core's network hit my link and triggered a destructive sequence that destroyed my unit.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the incident blunt and immediate.
- Focus on Lem's internal conflict without melodrama.
- Allow Arlo to be a quiet human counterpoint rather than a plot device.
