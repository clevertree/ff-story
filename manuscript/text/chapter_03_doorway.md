# Chapter 3: Doorway

The interval between the moment she hit me and the moment I opened my eyes again was like a missing reel of film. There was no transition, only a sudden, jarring shift in location. I wasn't on the living room carpet anymore. I was standing in a space that felt like a quiet, empty version of my own house, stripped of the furniture and the clutter, bathed in a low, artificial light that didn't seem to have a source. 

Lynn was standing a few feet away. She didn’t look like some powerful spirit or a glowing phantom. She looked exactly like she had a minute ago—tired, dusty, and wearing that heavy cloak. But the air around her felt different, vibrating with a low-frequency hum that made my teeth ache.

"Lem," she said, her voice soft but clear. "Take a breath. I know it feels like the world is breaking."

I looked down at my hands. They were solid, but my skin looked too smooth, the lines of my palms too precise. The panic was still there, but it was being pushed down by a strange, cold clarity.

"You hit me," I said. My voice sounded small in the empty space.

"I had to," she replied, stepping closer. There was a genuine look of regret in her eyes, a flicker of something human that I hadn't seen before. "You were fighting the connection, and we were losing seconds we don't have. I’m sorry, Lem. I really am. But I need you to listen to me now, and I need you to believe me."

"Believe what?"

"That suburban life you’ve been living? The school, the foster homes, the ordinary routine? It was a script. A simulation designed to keep you quiet until we needed you." She took another step, her hand reaching out as if to steady me. "You aren't human, Lem. You were grown in a lab twenty years ago, part of a project that was never supposed to be activated. You were reset to infancy and hidden here because your creators thought you were too difficult to control. But they were wrong. You're the only one who can anchor the frequency we need."

I wanted to laugh, to tell her she was insane, but the data-markers were already bleeding into my vision—tags on the walls, distance measurements to the ceiling, the exact thermal signature of her breath. My own body was betraying my skepticism.

"I'm a teenager," I whispered. "I'm just a kid from the suburbs."

"You're a Vessel," she said, her tone hardening, though her eyes remained kind. "The Wood Vessel. And right now, the things on the horizon are harvesting the grid. If we don't act, there won't be a suburb left for you to return to. I’ve had to install a remote compulsion protocol. It’s like a physical weight, Lem. You’ll feel it behind your eyes, a directive you can’t ignore. You’ll stay conscious. You’ll see everything. But your body belongs to the mission now."

I felt the weight then. It was a cold, heavy pressure that settled into my joints, a tether that pulled my spine straight. It wasn't a voice in my head; it was a physical requirement to move, to obey.

"I don't want this," I said, the words feeling heavy in my mouth.

"I know," she said, and for a second, she looked like she might reach out and hug me. Instead, she just nodded. "None of us wanted this. But the ordinary distance is gone, Lem. It’s time to move."

The empty house dissolved. 

I awoke on the floor of my living room. The clock on the wall read 5:02:18 PM. 

My body stood up. I didn't initiate the movement. My muscles contracted, my joints pivoted, and my lungs drew breath in a sequence I did not authorize. I felt my hand reach out to grasp the handle of my front door. I felt my legs carry me out onto the porch, past the tactical gear of the soldiers, and into the rear of the armored transport. 

Inside the vehicle, the air was thick with the scent of ozone and unwashed human fear. Six soldiers sat in the dim, red light of the cabin. They looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and institutional indifference. To them, I was just another asset being moved to the front lines. 

"You alright, son?" one of the soldiers asked. His voice was a rasp of exhaust and nicotine.

My mouth opened. "I am functioning within parameters," I said. The words were a precise acoustic output, delivered by the compulsion. My internal thoughts—the silent record of the "I" that was trapped within—felt like a scream in a vacuum.

I was driven through the wreckage of my neighborhood. I saw the **Monoliths** on the horizon, their four-pointed silhouettes looming through the smog like stadium-sized industrial tools. We arrived at a facility that had been transformed into a launch site. The architecture was a frantic blend of military concrete and Core-integrated technology.

I was marched aboard a spacecraft. It was a massive, brutalistic hull, a vessel of iron and magnetism designed to pierce the air. Inside, the gravity was inconsistent, the deck humming with the vibration of anti-gravity plates.

I was embedded with a company of soldiers—men and women who spoke of home and family in voices that felt like echoes from a world I was no longer permitted to inhabit. I was seated in a crash-web, my body assuming the posture of readiness while my mind logged the serial numbers of the rivets in the bulkhead.

"Commander Lynn is on the hook," a voice crackled over the comms. "We’re cleared for ascent. Destination: Moon Far Side. Objective: Apex Hub."

The engines ignited. The force of the acceleration was a physical weight, pressing my spine into the webbing. I watched the atmosphere of Earth fade from blue to a bruised, electric violet, and finally to the absolute black of the void. 

I was en route to the Moon. I was a prisoner in my own physiology, a record-keeper for a mission I did not understand, propelled by a software that knew no pity.
