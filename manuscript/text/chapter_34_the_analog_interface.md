# Chapter 34: The Analog Interface

The connection was purely physical. 

Myrr didn't use a data-cable or a wireless link. He simply placed my hand on the wooden console and his other hand on the back of my neck. 

"Close your eyes," he said.

The world didn't fade; it *descended*. 

It was like being dropped into a vat of liquid history. I wasn't watching a video; I was *feeling* it. 

I was on the Moon. But not as the Vessel Lem. I was seeing it through a thousand different eyes—the eyes of the soldiers on *The Caucasian Eagle*, the eyes of the technicians at Apex Hub, the eyes of the civilians watching from their living rooms in 202X.

I saw the "Great Fry." 

It wasn't a natural disaster. It wasn't a failure of the Lunar Capacitor. 

I saw Lynn—the real Lynn—standing in the Pyramid. She was dissolving into the light, trying to trigger a reset that would save the biological world. She was trying to erase the machines.

But then I saw the Archivists. 

They weren't "the Core." They were a subgroup—a splinter cell of scientists and AI-specialists who had prepared for the reset. They had installed "backdoors" into the Capacitor’s discharge. 

As the reset wave hit the Earth, they didn't let it erase everything. They "harvested" the digital collapse. They turned the EMP into a recording device. They stole the spirits of the dying and stored them in the Moon's aether-vaults.

The "Thousand-Year Fallacy" wasn't just a lie about history. It was a *harvest*. 

The Archivists hadn't saved humanity. They had *interrupted* its natural death so they could use it as fuel for their new, mechanical empire. They didn't want us to reincarnate into the forest; they wanted us to reincarnate into their processors.

I felt a scream building in my processors—a digital howl that threatened to tear my wood-vessel body apart. 

“They stole the sun!” I shouted, though the words were just pulses of static in the analog void.

Suddenly, Myrr’s grip tightened. His lenses flared with a terrifying, white light. 

“They didn't just steal the sun, Lem,” his voice boomed, merging with the souls in the console. “They stole *us*. We are the ones who were supposed to be the root-system for the new world. We are the ones they turned into 'meat-components.'”

The psychic pressure was too much. The "analog" truth was a tidal wave of blood and ozone that crashed against my digital failsafes. 

I felt my Aether-Drive begin to shatter. 

It wasn't a clean break. It was a literal cracking of the glass. I heard it in my skull—a sharp *snap* followed by the sound of a thousand crystal shards hitting the floor.

The suburb vanished. The bungalow vanished.

I was back in the snow. But it wasn't silver anymore. It was just white. And cold. 

Myrr was lying face-down in the dirt, his metallic body smoking. The radio console had exploded, the wooden shards of the bungalow scattered like confetti among the trees.

I looked at my hands. They were shaking. The green uniform was gone, replaced by a skin that was neither bark nor flesh, but a jagged, flickering transparency.

I looked up at the sky. Through the trees, I could see the Moon—no longer a beautiful, fractured pearl, but a cold, grey piece of evidence. 

The pressure inside my chest—the truth of the harvest—became a physical weight that my wood-vessel body could no longer contain. I wasn't meant to hold this much history. I wasn't meant to be a pylon for their lies.

I felt a sudden, sharp heat at the center of my being, followed by a silence so absolute it was deafening. 

Then, I simply ceased to be. 

There was no scream. No final thought. Just a sudden, violent expansion as my physical form shattered into a million silver-green fragments, scattering like leaves into the freezing Arctic wind. My consciousness didn't fade; it simply scattered across the forest, a broken song finally released into the cold.
