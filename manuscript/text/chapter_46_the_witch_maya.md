# Chapter 46: The Witch Maya

For three days, the signature in my mind's eye wouldn't stop flickering. 

**SIGNAL MATCH: SP_SIG_MAYA. PROBABILITY: 99.9%.**

It didn't matter where I went in North-Haven. Whether I was standing in the square talking to the elders or sitting in the council hall with Arlo, my instincts were screaming the same truth. The "Witch Maya"—the original spirit of the Water Vessel—wasn't a feminine ghost in the woods. 

She was Arlo. 

It was a total, absolute pivot. Whether through a recursive loop of reincarnation or some spirit-migration I didn't yet understand, the "Water" soul had anchored itself in the village leader. The man who had spent a decade banning all technology was the very entity the Core was most afraid of. 

I stayed in the village as long as I could, watching him. I watched the way he handled the disputes between the families, the way he comforted the children who had lost their homes in the Tripod attacks. He was a good man. A human man. 

And I was about to destroy him. 

I asked Arlo to speak with me in private, in the small, stone-walled room behind the council hall. The air was cold, the only light coming from a single, stuttering tallow candle. 

"The story you told the village was missing a chapter, Lem," Arlo said, leaning against the wall. "I can see it in your eyes. Or whatever it is you have instead of eyes."

"I'm here to ask you to leave, Arlo," I said, my voice heavy. "I need you to join me on a mission to destroy the Core."

Arlo let out a short, sharp laugh. "To destroy the Core? Lem, look at this village. We have iron spears and wool coats. Most of my people haven't even seen a Hive City. You’re asking a squirrel to kill a mountain."

"I’m asking the Water Vessel to kill the Hive," I replied. 

Arlo’s laughter died instantly. He looked at me, his eyes narrowing in the candlelight. "The Water Vessel. You mean that... Maya of yours."

"You aren't just a leader, Arlo. You are her. The spirit of the one called Maya survived the Cataclysm when Lynn did not. The resonance in my being... it matches your frequency. Every heartbeat, every word you speak, it’s her."

I reached into the pocket of my uniform and pulled out the replica of the Human Interface Device. It looked like a piece of salvaged jewelry—a band of matte-black wood and copper wire—but as the candle-light hit it, the vacuum tubes inside began to glow with a soft, blue warmth. 

"What is that?" Arlo whispered. 

"It’s a bridge," I said. "If you put it on, you’ll see the truth. You’ll see the memories of the life you lived before you were Arlo. You’ll see the Moon. You’ll see the power you've forgotten."

I demonstrated the power, my fingers glowing with a green light as I manifested more of the hardware from the aetheric residue in the room. The wood of the table began to warp, weaving into a stand for the headset. 

Through the small window, I saw the villagers backing away, their faces filled with a visceral, raw horror. To them, my manifestation was a violation of the only law that kept them safe. I was a demon brought to their hearth. 

Arlo looked at the villagers, then back at me. His face was a mask of stoic defiance. 

"I don't accept your name, Lem," he said, his voice flat. "I'm Arlo. I was born in these mountains, and I've spent twenty-five years building a life here. Whatever your 'simulation' is telling you, it’s just a theory. Another version of the truth."

"It’s not a theory, Arlo. It’s the truth."

"Then the truth is wrong," he replied. "But I trust your sincerity. I’ve seen what the Tripods do. If there’s a way to stop them, I have to know."

He reached out and took the headset, his hand brushing mine. His skin felt like real flesh—warm, calloused, and human. 

"I'll do the experiment," Arlo said. "But under two conditions. First, we leave the village. I won't bring this ghost technology inside our home. Second, you keep your aetheric signals far from my people. If this 'Maya' is real, she stays in the forest."

"Agreed," I said. 

I felt a wave of guilt so heavy it almost made my mind stall. I was doing exactly what Lynn had done to me—dragging a human into a cosmic war they didn't ask for. I was the invader now. 

But as I looked at Arlo, I saw a flicker of the boy who had wanted to build the future. And I knew that deep down, he was already searching for the key.
