# Chapter 18: The Long Exile

**Title:** The Long Exile
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
With no orders, I recorded local weather patterns, watching the snow accumulate and melt on a single branch while observing fire patterns on the horizon and recording the coordinates of smoke lines in my log.

Remaining in the area to avoid detection, I monitored the expansion of the Fire Cities and noted the locations of new smoke columns. My records included a list of non-functional machinery and a log of which villages remained occupied.

I stayed in one location to continue my observations and kept the data I had gathered.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain quiet endurance rather than dramatic exile rhetoric.
- Use sparse details (tracks, smoke) to show the spread of the Fire Cities.
- Keep Lem's tone pragmatic and observational.

## Synopsis
Solitude and observing Rahu's influence from the shadow of the forest.
