# Chapter 40: The Exile

The North was dying in a pillar of black smoke. 

I stood on the ridge, the cold wind whipping at my new green skin, and watched the White Forest burn. The dwellers were gone, Myrr was gone, and the "Analog Sanctuary" was now just a memory being erased by the fire. The silence of the mountain was deafening, weighted by the absence of the "Key" I was supposedly carrying. 

I had no destination. I had no mission. I was a ghost who had forgotten how to haunt. 

But I couldn't leave yet. Not until I saw the face of the fire. 

I began a wide, stealthy arc around the perimeter of the forest. I moved through the deep snow of the high ridges, using the shadows of the granite cliffs to maintain my distance. From this height, the scale of the destruction was even more horrific. The invisible heat-rays had carved a perfect, glass-bottomed corridor through the center of the woods, a road of molten silica that shimmered in the dying light. 

Then I saw the source. 

On the windward side of the forest, a massive clearing had been carved out as if by a giant’s knife. In the center of the clearing, a line of silver-white machines shimmered in the heat-haze. They weren't moving; they were stationary platforms, twice the size of a Gorgon, with heavy, rotating hoods that tracked the sky. 

The invisible heat-rays. 

Overseeing them was a figure I’d seen a thousand times in my dreams. He was silver, polished, and perfectly still. Rahu. 

He didn't have a weapon in his hand. He didn't need one. He was connected to the platforms by a web of pulsing cables, his gauntlet glowing with a faint, angry heat as he coordinated the attack. Around him, a legion of Metal Vessels—the shared-consciousness units the Core had built after the Fry—were methodically dismantling the arsenal. They moved with a terrifying, clinical efficiency, their movements perfectly synchronized, like a single organism with a hundred limbs.

I recognized the weapons. They were the same high-output platforms Drexler had shown me in the Mission 2 briefings—the "Utopian Shield." They hadn't been built to protect anything. They had been built to demonstrate that nothing was beyond the Core's reach. 

The attack on the White Forest wasn't a tactical necessity. Myrr and his people were a rounding error in the Core’s grand plan. No, this was a statement. This was Drexler proving that the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" could be enforced with the stroke of a key. 

I watched Rahu for a long time. He looked like the perfected version of what I was supposed to be—efficient, unquestioning, and lethal. He was beautiful in his own, terrible way. He was a piece of the Hive that had forgotten how to be a person. 

I turned my back on the fire. 

I didn't need to see any more. The alliance with Myrr was dead, the forest was ash, and the girl who was supposedly "Maya" was a ghost I wasn't even sure I wanted to find. 

I began to walk. 

I headed North, toward the highest ridges where the air was too thin for the Archivists’ atmospheric scrubbers. I walked in the most opposite direction I could find—away from Cradle Zero, away from New Horizon, away from the Moon. 

The lone figure of a green-skinned boy, disappearing into the grey horizon of the unknown wilderness. 

The "Awakening" was over. My exile had begun.
