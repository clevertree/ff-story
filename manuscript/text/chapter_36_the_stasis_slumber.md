# Chapter 36: The Stasis Slumber

Time stopped being a river and became a frozen lake. 

In the capsule at Cradle Zero, my body was a statue of green wood and silver wire, pinned to the wall by a field of blue energy that didn't just paralyze my limbs; it paralyzed my thoughts. The "Bright Path"—that persistent, golden lure that the Archivists used to guide me home after every death—was gone. In its place was a featureless, grey void. 

I was trapped in the anchor. 

For what felt like decades, I drifted in that silence. I tried to scream, but I had no throat. I tried to move, but I had no muscles. I was just a consciousness caught in a loop, a ghost haunted by the humming of the desert lab’s atmospheric scrubbers. 

Then, a light appeared.

It wasn't the Archivist’s path. It was a single, thin thread of flickering red, like a vein of fire in the dark. It didn't pull at me; it just waited. And for the first time in my life, I chose to follow it.

The void didn't fade; it *descended*. 

I was back in the White Forest. But it wasn't the sanctuary I remembered. It was a war zone.

I was standing in the deep interior, where the trees were so thick they blocked out the sky. It felt like the moment I had first arrived—the moment the electronic snake had consumed me—but the details were wrong. The air was thick with the smell of ozone and burning sap.

I saw them then. The Three Guardians. 

They were electronic snakes, just like the one that had swallowed me, but they were twice as large. Their metallic scales were glowing an angry, molten orange, thrashing against the trees in a state of terminal rage. They weren't hunting; they were defending.

Suddenly, the air rippled. 

It wasn't a sound or a light. It was a distortion, like a heat-shimmer over a desert road. An invisible beam of energy sliced through the canopy, cutting through the branches of the "undestroyable" wood-water trees like they were made of damp paper. 

Where the beam struck, the results were horrific. 

The ancient, superconducting polymers that made up the forest didn't just catch fire; they vaporized. One moment a tree was a pillar of life, and the next it was a tower of blinding white-hot plasma that shattered into glass as it cooled. 

The snakes didn't stand a chance. 

The first one attempted to rush the source of the invisible beam, its body a blurring line of chrome. The air rippled again, and the snake simply... vanished. A single burst of heat so intense it skipped the liquid phase entirely, turning the machine into a cloud of glowing gas.

The second snake—the one that had previously carried me—reared up, its lenses wide and burning. It hissed a frequency that brought a taste of copper to my mouth, a desperate, angry poem that I felt in the depths of my Aether-Drive. 

Then came the flash. 

The invisible ray hit the snake's head-sphere head-on. I heard the sound of a thousand crystal bells shattering at once. The snake’s body exploded into a million jagged fragments, each one glowing with a dying, orange heat. 

As the pieces hit the ground, the vision instantly cut to black.

The forest was gone. The fire was gone. 

I was back in the grey void of the stasis field. I was alone, trapped in the silence of my paralyzed form. But the memory of the flash stayed with me, a white-hot scar on my mind.

I wasn't just a captive anymore. I was a witness. And I realized that the "second snake"—the one that had held a fragment of my own spirit—was dead. 

The severance was absolute. I felt the last of my ties to the Core’s world snapping like dry twigs. I wasn't Lem the hero. I wasn't Lem the soldier. I was just Lem. 

And as the years began to slide by in the dark, I started to look through the grey. I started to see the real world not as a screen, but as a map of thermal and aetheric signatures. I watched the cities grow. I watched the desert cool. And I waited for the moment when the blue light would finally flicker.
