# Chapter 6: Alone on the Moon

**Title:** Alone on the Moon
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The crash caused multiple injuries as the ship's interior grew loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe, alone in the wreckage; there were no other crew members in sight.

Before I could look around, a machine removed me from the wreckage. Iris Novak was there, looking over a handheld display—she had already initiated the extraction. She didn't look at me at first. I heard a report coming through her headset. Someone was telling her the final numbers on the evacuation of the ship I had just been on. They said sixty percent of the crew had made it to the escape pods.

It turned out Iris and her team were among those who had escaped. I hadn't seen them leave; I had been left behind in the chaos.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain sensory sparsity; avoid abstract or emotional speculation.
- Limit Lem's observations to verifiable facts: instrument readings, visible actions, and what people said.
- Lem is the only survivor who didn't escape on an escape pod; he is alone in the wreckage when rescued.
- Novak rescues Lem before he can look around or confirm the presence of other crew.
- Avoid Lem describing himself as 'functional'; use observational phrasing (e.g., "Novak noticed me" or "Novak assessed my state") instead.
- Document the plasma event with sensory details and pilot comms as the primary sources of evidence.
- Ensure Lem's choice is concise and presented as a pragmatic action rather than an internalized melodrama.
- Emphasize small physical details that reveal machine and human fragility, not assumed kinship or feelings.

Once Novak finally noticed me, she spoke in short, factual sentences. A message arrived from Lynn stating that my internal drive was functioning and I was ready for the mission, though I could still feel the vibration of the impact in my frame.

While the other survivors left the area, I sat in a small hover vehicle and chose not to follow them. I took the vehicle and joined the strike teams moving forward.

Built with precise lines and angles, lunar structures loomed as large machine Striders moved across the surface. I heard high-frequency signals from the human pilots on the open frequencies. The Striders moved with a frantic, uncoordinated gait. When one Strider was destroyed, the radio channel went silent.

Plasma began to lift from distant outposts as slow, swelling balls of ionized energy while my heat sensors picked up intense discharges. At first the fleet treated them as distant fire, but when several of the spheres suddenly accelerated and arced toward the metal frames of our vehicles, the pilots realized they were being targeted. The forward units were destroyed as the fleet tried to draw the fire toward the mountains, but the plasma ran along the canyon walls and kept pace until the formation broke apart.

## Revision Notes
- Clarify that plasma balls take time to rise and are not immediately recognized as active threats.
- Pilots detect targeting only when the plasma accelerates toward vehicles; add sensory details showing a delay between initial sightings and target lock.
- Ensure adjacent chapters that describe plasma behavior (Chapter 6, Chapter 7) reference the same mechanics for consistency.

A human pilot in the bike fleet peeled off and moved toward a cliff where a light was flashing. He sent a telemetry report. It said: 'Confirmed: Rahu.' Right after that, I saw him toggle his communication switch to the off position. He didn't say anything as the light hit his machine. He didn't yell. He just disappeared into the flash. I don't know why he turned it off, but I noted the silence.

## Synopsis
Lem experiences the crash and slips into a disorienting Aether-Drive fugue.
