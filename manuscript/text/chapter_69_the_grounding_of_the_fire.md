# Chapter 85: The Grounding of the Fire

The battle in the central chamber of the Lunar Pyramid was a study in elemental extremes. Rahu moved like a solar flare—fast, unpredictable, and capable of melting anything he touched. Lem responded with the adaptability of the forest. Every time Rahu’s fire strikes tore through Lem’s form, Lem’s spirit would simply "re-root" in a nearby wood-water pod, rebuilding his physical presence in seconds.

But Lem was losing. Rahu was no longer falling for the simple tricks of Mission 1. He was more advanced, his battle subroutines polished by the Core’s latest data. He moved with a speed that defied Lem’s physical limits, striking from angles that even Lem’s multi-spectrum sensors couldn't anticipate.

Lem looked around the sealed chamber for options. The room was a killing floor. He needed leverage.

Suddenly, one of the sealed doors began to shake. A deep, rhythmic thud echoed through the stone. After three massive strikes, the lock shattered, and the door burst inward.

General Tor stepped into the hall.

Rahu and Lem both paused, their elemental signatures flickering. Rahu knew that if the General joined the fight, his advantage might vanish—especially since Tor had just let Lem in. 

"The General is here to finish the job," Rahu hissed, his fire-aura intensifying. "Lem is trying to initiate the reset. He's working for the Maya cult."

Tor didn't move. He looked at the flaming Rahu, then at the pulsating wooden forms of Lem. 

"I may be naive," Tor said, his voice surprisingly deep in the enclosed space. "But I am not stupid. There is no reason in the world that Lem would want to reset—nor would Dr. Vane, for that matter. And if she allowed him into this pyramid, it could only be to stop the Core."

Tor stepped forward, his massive iron frame casting a long shadow across the floor. "I think we both know who has ordered you to do what you are doing, Rahu. Just as we both know that you can't resist the orders."

Tor raised his pulse-cannon. "But I can. Because I’ve been given new orders by Dr. Vane. The Architect of Order is under new management."

The ensuing battle was epic. Tor’s terrestrial strength combined with Lem’s wood-water resilience provided a formidable defense against Rahu’s speed. They fought as a unified front, their movements synchronized by a shared aetheric link. But Rahu was a titan. He was still too fast, his thermal strikes chipping away at Tor’s heavy armor.

In a final, desperate gambit, Lem dissolved his physical form into a stream of liquid wood and merged directly into Tor’s body. The General’s armor began to sprout silver-green vines that reinforced the gaps in his plating. Together, they launched a combined wood-earth strike—a physical blow that didn't just hit Rahu, it smothered him. The wood-sap acted as a cooling agent, and the earth-mass of the general provided the pressure to snuff out Rahu's internal flame.

Rahu fell to the ground, his fire out, his form gray and smoking.

As Lem and Tor separated back into their individual forms, a loud buzz filled the chamber. Massive cathodes—gigantic energy-rods hidden in the ceiling—began to lower. They glowed with an intense electrical charge and fired simultaneously.

Both Lem and the General were struck by the high-voltage arcs. They fell into a state of total paralysis, their internal circuits overloaded. 

Rahu, however, didn't stay down. He stood up, absorbing the energy from the cathodes into his own body. Electricity began to arc from his skin; it seemed the Core was using the pyramid’s primary power to fuel their warrior. 

In a moment of purely instinctive survival, Lem allowed his body to spill into a flat pool of globular metal on the floor. He spread the pool until it touched the paralyzed General. As soon as their forms met, Tor also dissolved into the liquid mass. 

The electrical arcs, seeking the path of least resistance, struck the pool. But as a low-lying conductor on the ground, the electricity simply dispersed. 

The pool began to form a giant blister—a half-sphere that pulsed with energy. The ground shook as the blister forced its way into the rock floor of the pyramid—not into the metal framework, but deeper, into the ancient lunar stone itself. It was a root growing into the heart of the moon.

As soon as they reached the grounding rock, the combined node began to act as a massive anode. All the electricity being fired by the ceiling cathodes was pulled into the node and redirected—straight at Rahu. 

Rahu was struck with a massive, paralyzing shock of his own energy. He screamed as the voltage overloaded his ports. 

The cathode machinery in the ceiling groaned and then broke off entirely, crashing to the floor in a shower of sparks. The Core had realized their weapon was being turned against them; they had jettisoned the equipment to prevent Lem from drawing any more power.

The anode node separarted. Lem and Tor reformed as separate entities on the dusty floor. Tor noticed that his features had changed—silver wooden grain now rippled through his iron skin. 

But Rahu was already moving. He was no longer interested in losing to tricks. He was enraged. He dashed forward and, with a flat, deliberate strike, knocked Lem across the chamber. It was a blow of pure kinetic force that sent Lem slamming into the obsidian wall, hundreds of feet away.

With Lem separated, Rahu turned on Tor. He struck the general again and again—a blur of heat and steel. Tor took the blows, his iron resolve holding, but the wood-water elements within him were receding fast. 

"Your water is gone!" Rahu roared. "You're nothing but dry tinder!"

He hit Tor with a final, massive blow. The General’s body flared up like a match head—a brilliant, blinding flash of orange flame that consumed his energy instantly. 

Tor fell, unconscious and scorched. Lem, finally standing up and limping back toward the center, watched as Rahu prepared a final strike.

Rahu hit the General so hard that Tor’s body didn't just break; it disintegrated. The Architect of Order was gone.
