# Chapter 23: The Water Resonance

**Title:** The Water Resonance
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Arlo lived in a village. The air contained the scent of peat and drying fish. He operated machinery with high efficiency. He monitored the flow of the river frequently.

The village did not use electronic signals. There were no pings or beacons for the Core to detect. This was an intentional design to avoid surveillance.

Arlo demonstrated how natural materials could interfere with signals. He showed me that moss membranes can reduce signal strength. We performed a test by placing a wet membrane over a local repeater. The beacon signal dropped. The tablet showed a significant decrease in signal strength. He said that a machine's movement could be guided by water levels and natural patterns instead of electronic wires.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the lesson practical and sensory: water as a masking medium.
- Show Arlo as a technician with local knowledge, not a symbol.
- Maintain Lem's observational restraint.

## Synopsis
Identifying the lack of electronic signatures in the northern village; meeting Arlo.
