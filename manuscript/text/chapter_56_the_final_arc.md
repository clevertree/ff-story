# Chapter 56: The Final Arc

The massive Monoliths behind us were no longer an army; they were a distraction. They were the burning light that I had used to blind Drexler while I went for his throat. 

"Twenty-five percent," I said, my consciousness vibrating through the hull of the *Analog-One*. "Launch the remainder."

From the shadows of the dunes, a second fleet emerged—the survivors of the North-Haven mobilization, the smaller, faster machines that hadn't been committed to the main battle. There were no Monoliths here. Instead, there were hover-bikes, high-speed cargo-vessels, and two specialized boarding-craft that I had grown using the blueprints of the old 202X drop-ships. 

We weren't walking. We were screaming across the sand at three hundred miles per hour. 

"Altitude check?" Myrr's voice came over the internal comms-link. He was strapped into the pilot’s seat of the *Analog-One*, his face illuminated by the cyan glow of the wood-core console. 

"Six feet," I replied. "Stay in the troughs of the dunes. If we crest the ridges, their high-altitude satellites will pick us up."

The sensation was terrifying. The hover-jets of the fleet kicked up a continuous, blinding wall of sand that followed us like a ghost. I could feel the desert floor through the wood of the craft—the way the magnetic fields of the ancient sand-currents pushed against our hulls. 

Behind us, the horizon was a nightmare of orange fire and white-hot flashes. The "Battle of Trees" was at its peak, the Sky-Monoliths raining down more fire every second. But here, in the low desert, there was only the roar of the wind and the high-pitched whine of our Aether-Drives. 

"They won't drop pods on Cradle Zero," Myrr said, his eyes scanning the instruments. "The infrastructure is too delicate. Drexler has his archives there, his server-farms, his life-support systems. He'd be destroying the very thing he’s trying to protect."

"That’s our only chance," I said. "We go into the heart of the machinery. We make ourselves impossible to target without destroying the base itself."

We were ten miles from the perimeter. Five. Two. 

The sand-dusted towers of Cradle Zero began to loom out of the haze—a labyrinth of white, Synodic-grown spires and metal conduits that stretched for miles in every direction. It looked like a city of ghosts, silent and unresponsive. 

"Contact!" one of the Crew shouted. 

A battery of perimeter-defense turrets flickered into life on the closest spire. Red beams of light shot across the sand, cutting through our formation like knives. One of our hover-bikes disintegrated in a puff of smoke, its pilot thrown into the sand. 

"Don't stop!" I ordered. "Maximize speed! Aim for the main intake conduits!"

I pushed the *Analog-One* into a vertical bank, the G-forces pressing Myrr into his seat. We were weaving between the towers now, the metal-and-synergized hulls of the Core’s base flashing past our view-ports in a blur of white and gray. 

The perimeter was breached. We were inside the "cradle" of the Machine. 

But as we cleared the first ring of towers, I didn't see an army of Metal Vessels waiting for us. I didn't see an infrastructure in panic. 

I saw a massive, silent plaza, and at its center, a single, glowing entrance that led down into the earth. 

"It's wide open," Myrr whispered. 

"It's an invitation," I replied. "And we’re going in."
