# Chapter 38: Analog Lem

I stood in the center of the ruins, but I was not the same entity that had died here. 

For the first time in fifteen years, I had reconstituted without a tank, without a server, and without the permission of Dr. Novak. I looked at my hands—they were five-fingered, but the skin was a deep, matte-green that looked more like polished oak than metal. There was no artificial flicker in my vision, no mission clock counting down the seconds, no Archivist heartbeat in the back of my skull. 

I was **Analog Lem**. 

I was built from the deep, organic-machine substrate of the White Forest itself. I could feel the trees around me—not as objects, but as anchors. The forest wasn't just a place; it was a physical extension of my own Aether-Drive. I was no longer a ghost in their machine; I was the machine.

But the machine was burning.

A massive explosion rocked the clearing, the shockwave nearly knocking me off my feet. I looked toward the east. The fire I’d seen in my dream was no longer a distant column; it was a wall of white-hot light that was eating its way through the "undestroyable" wood-water canopy. 

Then came the plasma.

It didn't look like a laser beam. It was "clumsy"—a thick, arcing cord of blue-white fire that jumped and twisted through the air like a living thing. It didn't move in a straight line; it searched for the nearest conductive surface, arcing from tree to tree in a series of random, terrifying leaps. 

Everything it touched didn't just catch fire; it erupted. The superconducting polymers of the pines reached their thermal limit and vaporized instantly, turning the forest floor into a landscape of liquid glass and glowing gas. 

I started to run. 

I didn't have a plan. I didn't have a destination. I just ran, my wood-vessel limbs moving with a speed and grace I’d never felt in the Core’s heavy suits. I dodged the arcing plasma as it cut through the trees above me, the heat so intense it felt like it was trying to peel the wood from my bones. 

The forest was empty. No animals, no electronic snakes, no villagers. It was a silence punctuated only by the roar of the fire and the scream of the plasma arcs. It felt like Myrr and his people had already given up, leaving the sanctuary to be erased.

I reached a section of the forest where the trees were thicker, the canopy a solid ceiling of dark green. In the middle of a small clearing, I saw it. 

A carrier platform. 

It was a piece of the inhabitants' unique technology—a wide, flat disk made of matte-black composite, half-buried in the frozen earth. It had clearly crashed, its guidance-fins twisted and its underside scorched by a direct hit from a plasma arc. It was dead. 

I approached the craft, my hands trembling. I wasn't looking for a weapon; I was looking for a way out. I needed to find Myrr. I needed to know what "Plan B" really was. 

Just as I reached the edge of the disk, I felt it. 

The sudden, cold weight of multiple targeting lasers locking onto my chest.

I froze.

From the shadows of the unburned trees, a dozen figures emerged. They were wearing the same masked, copper-threaded uniforms as Myrr’s guards, but they didn't have his steady, patient eyes. They held their rifles—strange, blocky things made of wood and vacuum tubes—with a terrifying, immediate hostility.

Myrr wasn't with them.

"Halt, Vessel," a voice said, amplified by an analog speaker that cracked with static. 

I raised my hands, my palms open. "I'm not with the Core. I’m Lem. I was here with Myrr."

"Myrr is dead," the voice replied, cold and final. "And you are the thing that killed him. This time, we don't need an interface to see your record. We have the data of the fire."

One of the guards moved forward, his rifle-barrel pressing against my forehead. The wood of my skin felt the heat of the tube-charge. I looked into his mask, and I saw the end of the alliance. 

They weren't looking for a hero. They were looking for a scapegoat.
