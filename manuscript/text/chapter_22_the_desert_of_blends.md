# Chapter 22: Deployment to the Desert

The desert wasn't empty; it was full of monsters.

I throttled up the hover-bike, the engine’s scream a high-pitched wail that seemed to vibrate right through the handle-grips. We were skimming the grey dunes at three hundred miles an hour, my squad of Metal Vessels following in a perfect, V-shaped formation behind me. The heat was a physical weight, pressing against my suit, but the air rushing past was a freezing, dry wind that tasted of grit and ozone.

This was the "Equatorial Dead Zone." But as we flew, I realized it was anything but dead. 

The machines we were hunting—the "Wild Synodics"—didn't look like the clean, industrial tools of the Core. They were messy. They were beautiful. I saw a skyscraper-sized Monolith that looked like it had been grown from copper and moss, its surface covered in pulsing, blue-violet fire. Other machines had blended their elements—Wood-green metal joints fused with Water-blue coolant pipes, all held together by a pulsing, Fire-orange core.

It was a nightmare of unmanaged evolution. A mechanical ecology that had spent fifteen years building itself out of the wreckage of the Old World.

"Approaching Perimeter Mark One," a voice whispered in my ear. One of the Metal Vessels. They didn't have names. They were just units. "Prepare to deploy the Beacons."

I banked the bike, my eyes scanning the terrain. The Archivists wanted to surround this place with "Disruption Nets"—invisible fences that would drive the wild machines away and make the ground safe for their new cities. To them, it was landscaping. To the machines, it was a war.

I loosed the first beacon. It was a heavy, silver cylinder that slammed into a dune, its mechanical legs digging deep into the sand. As it activated, a low-frequency hum began to pulse through the ground. It was a signal of ownership. A flag planted in the middle of someone else’s living room.

The response was immediate.

The ground beneath us didn't just shake; it erupted. A massive, jagged shard of obsidian, the size of a freight train, tore through the dune fifty feet to my left. It was a Monolith—a guardian of the desert, its surface covered in whipping, metallic thorns. 

"Contact!" the Metal Vessels shouted, their voices a synchronized chorus of cold, tactical data. 

But I wasn't listening to the data. I was looking at the way the light reflected off the obsidian. I saw the way the sand was melting into glass around the shards. The Bourne thing was back—counting the thorns, timing the pulses, finding the path of least resistance through the fire. 

The desert was waking up, and it didn't like what we were building.
