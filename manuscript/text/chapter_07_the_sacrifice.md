# Chapter 6: The Sacrifice

**Title:** The Sacrifice
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Rahu stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position, he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, sending an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. On the radio, pilots gave disorganized orders.

Trying to avoid the plasma, the bike fleet moved into the canyons while ground forces remained trapped on the open plain. We were completely exposed, with no cover against the mysterious spheres arcing down from the mountain peak. As the plasma targeted us from above, the situation became a kill zone where strike meant total destruction. It was a moment of absolute desperation.

The ship *Hermes* flew through the debris field and cleared a corridor, drawing the reaction of the plasma spheres. Some hit the ground to cause electrical discharges in the gullies while others struck the *Hermes* as it fired its batteries. In the resulting collision, Rahu's core and the *Hermes* were both destroyed, leaving only heat, smoke, and a sudden quiet.

Though I couldn't see her, Iris Novak's steady voice came over the general comms, telling everyone to calm down. She claimed Tor had simplified the battlefield by clearing the path and explained that the sacrifice was necessary to save the mission. Taking command, she ordered us all forward toward the objective, though the ground under our route was unstable and shifted as we drove over it.

We entered the pyramid. The air was stable inside. The noise of the battle outside died away, leaving us in a heavy silence. Ground teams moved ahead, sliding seal plates into the jambs and locking the massive doors behind them — the seals were being deployed, not found. Novak looked at the closed doors ahead of us. We were inside, but the mission was far from over.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the action compressed and immediate.
- Emphasize Rahu's tactical advantage from the mountain peak, highlighting the relentless nature of the plasma array.
- Highlight the total exposure of the ground forces; the lack of cover creates the desperate tactical necessity for Tor's sacrifice. 
- Emphasize Lem's observational distance when describing Tor's sacrifice and later altered state.
- Avoid adding speculative metaphysics; show only what Lem can observe.
- Clarify: ground forces deploy seals on doors inside the pyramid; seals are an active defense deployed by our teams rather than pre-existing.

## Synopsis
Rahu manifests as a profound threat; human forces are pinned down by flame.
