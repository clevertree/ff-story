# Chapter 13: The Confrontation

The heart of the pyramid was a cathedral of light. High above, the ceiling opened into a funnel that reached for the stars—a pillar of white, glowing energy that looked like a lightning bolt frozen in the air. At the center of it all stood Rahu. He wasn't moving. He didn't have to. He just stood there, a blur of heat that made the very air around him shimmer and dance.

General Tor stepped forward, his boots clicking on the obsidian floor. Behind him, Novak and the rest of us fanned out, our weapons ready. But the pyramid didn't need guards. It had him.

"Rahu," Tor said, his voice deep and echoing. "This is over. Step away from the Capacitor. Think of the men we’ve already lost. Think of the people back home."

Rahu’s laugh was a dry, crackling sound, like paper burning in a grate. "Compassion? From you, Tor? You just walked over the bones of your own fleet to get here. Don't talk to me about people."

"You killed them!" Tor roared, his hand white-knuckled on his sword hilt. "You vaporized a thousand men! And the debris you rained down on Earth—the cities, the families—you’re a murderer, Rahu! You’re playing with a weapon you don't even understand!"

Rahu tilted his head, his fiery shape pulsing with a dull, angry orange glow. "I took out your ships because they were coming to steal this place. I was defending it. But the cities? You really think I’m the one who cracked the Moon? You’re a fool, General. Your bosses in the Core have been pulling your strings since day one. They’re the ones who triggered the fractures. They’re the ones who sent the debris."

"Lies," Tor spat. "Nobody can control the Moon. Not even them. You’re just a machine in a corner, Rahu. You’re making up stories to save your skin."

"Is that what you really think?" Rahu asked, his voice getting quieter, more dangerous.

Tor raised his sword. "I think you’re done talking."

"Fire!" Novak screamed.

The room exploded into a hail of bullets. I watched them in slow motion—the Bourne thing again—tracking the path of every single round. They flew through the air, heading straight for Rahu’s chest. But as they hit the heat around him, they didn't stop. They just... turned into liquid. I watched a dozen lead slugs melt into glowing droplets and splash harmlessly onto the floor.

"Charges!" Novak yelled.

The soldiers switched to the stasis packs—metal jars filled with a pulsing blue light. They were supposed to lock an element in place, to freeze the fire. 

Rahu didn't wait. He moved like a blur, a streak of white-hot light that cut through the room. Tor swung his sword, a massive downward stroke that should have split the floor in half. The blade passed right through Rahu as if he were smoke. For a second, his body was cut in two, then the flames just... flowed back together. Before Tor could recover, Rahu slammed a flaming palm into his chest. Tor was thrown thirty feet across the room, his armor sparking as he skidded across the black stone.

"Fire!" Novak screamed again, her voice cracking.

The soldiers loosed the stasis charges. Blue nets of energy flew through the air, but Rahu ignored them. He went for the nearest squad instead. He didn't use a gun. He just touched a man’s helmet. There was no scream. Just a sudden, violent *poof* of white ash. The man was gone. Not killed—erased.

The rest of the squad broke. They ran for the door, their boots slipping on the obsidian. But the pyramid was already ahead of them. The huge slabs of stone slid shut, locking them in. They were trapped in the oven with the baker.

Rahu turned toward Novak. His fire was a blinding, electric blue now. "Give it up, Iris. You're trying to stop a landslide with a toothpick."

"We're stopping you," she said, her voice shaking but her rifle steady.

Rahu raised his hand to finish her, and that’s when she stepped in.

Lynn. She didn't look like a soldier anymore. She’d taken off her helmet, and her face was a mask of cold, perfect stillness. She stepped between Rahu and Novak, a silver blade in her hand that looked like it was made of ice.

Rahu’s fire-strike hit her shoulder, and I braced myself for the smell of burning meat. But instead, a spray of cold, clear water erupted from the wound. 

"Lynn," Rahu hissed, his fire turning a sick, dark orange. "You're with them now? You're helping the Core?"

"I’m doing what has to be done," Lynn said, her voice like ice shifting in a deep cave. "There’s no other way, Rahu. We talked about this. The cycle is over."

"We could have fought them together!" Rahu screamed.

"And what? Wait for them to find a better way to cage us?" Lynn asked. "It’s better this way. Total reset."

Novak saw her chance. "Now! Hit him!"

The last stasis charge hit Rahu right in the chest. A cage of blue light snapped around him, freezing him mid-step. For three heartbeats, the fire stopped. He was just a man made of orange glass.

Then, the fire flared up again. It started to burn *inside* the blue light. The cage turned purple, then white, and then it just shattered like a window. Rahu walked through the shards, his fire brighter than ever.

Lynn looked at me. It wasn't a look; it was a pull. A tug in the back of my mind that felt like a hand reaching out. 

"I can’t do it alone," her voice whispered inside my head. "Feed me, Lem. Wood to the water. Roots to the stream."

I didn't think about the risk. I just reached back.

The merger wasn't a hug; it was a drowning. My mind was suddenly flooded with her thoughts—cold, deep, and ancient. I felt my own Wood-nature, the solid, growing roots of my being, being washed over by her fluid strength. We were no longer two people. We were a forest being swallowed by a river. We were a Synanthrope.

The fight that followed... nobody in that room could have seen it. We were a blur of green and blue, moving faster than the eye could follow. When Rahu struck with his heat, we didn't just take it—we drank it. The Wood in me gave the Water in her the strength to hold the fire. We weren't a boy and a girl on a moon; we were a storm putting out a bonfire.

Water quenches. It’s the final rule. We pushed Rahu back, our combined weight crushing his fire down until it was nothing but a flickering spark on the stone. 

The merger snapped like a rubber band. I was thrown back, my head spinning and my lungs burning. I hit the floor and puked onto the obsidian. Lynn stood over Rahu, her face cold and terrifyingly beautiful. 

She didn't even look at us. She walked straight for the center of the chamber—the glowing heart of the Capacitor.

General Tor, his armor burnt to a crisp, tried to get up. "Lynn! Stop! The mission... we just have to disable it!"

He tried to run to her, but he hit an invisible wall ten feet out. I heard his skin sizzle as the energy field threw him back. But Lynn didn't even slow down. She walked right into the light.

She didn't burn. She just... dissolved. Her whole body turned into a spray of tiny, glowing crystals that were sucked up into the funnel of light.

"She’s not turning it off," Novak whispered, her voice hollow. She was staring at her tablet, her eyes wide. "She’s severing the connection. A total system wipe."

Lynn wasn't trying to save the mission. She was trying to save everything by erasing it. She was resetting the world so the Core could never touch it again.

The Moon began to scream. A high, vibrating hum that I felt in my bones, my blood, my very soul. The white light from the funnel became absolute, filling the room until I couldn't see the floor, the walls, or even my own hands. We were standing at the end of everything, and all I could think about was that suburban lawn and the smell of cut grass.
