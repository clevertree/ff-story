# Chapter 16: The Return

The transition wasn't a dream this time. It was a jolt, like the sudden snap of a bone. One moment I was floating in that green, sunlit living room with Lynn, hearing her final, whispering warning. The next, I was lying face-down in sand that felt like hot glass.

I choked on a breath of air that tasted of dry earth and old metal. I tried to push myself up, but my hands—my fingers were wrong. They were long, spindly things made of a dull green metal that didn't feel like skin. I looked down and saw three-legged joints and a heavy, mechanical hood. I wasn't Lem anymore. I was a Gorgon.

I stood up, my new legs clicking and whirring as they found purchase on the scorched ground. The scale of the world had changed. The sky above was no longer blue; it was a bruised purple, choked by a thick, grey smog that never seemed to move. Ahead of me, a massive pillar of fire roared into the heavens, a fountain of orange light that cast long, dancing shadows across the desert.

Cradle Zero.

I wasn't alone. Thousands of others like me—other Gorgons—were moving through the ruins of what used to be a forest. We weren't talking. We were just building. Moving heavy slabs of rock, welding metal together with invisible heat rays, acting out a program that didn't need words. I felt the pull of it, too—a low-frequency hum in the back of my mind that told me to pick up a piece of scrap and carry it to the wall.

Then, a sound cut through the roar of the fire.

It was a high-pitched scream of engines. I looked up and saw a line of silver shapes cutting through the smog. Hover-bikes. They moved with a speed that made the local machines look like they were standing still. At the front of the pack was a bike that glowed with a faint, angry heat.

Rahu.

He didn't look like he’d been blown to pieces on the Moon. He was whole, his armor polished to a mirror shine, his posture as rigid as a statue. He led the squad straight into the heart of the Fire City, the silver bikes weaving through the thermal plumes like they were choreographed. 

I watched him from the shadows of a half-collapsed wall. He didn't see me. Why would he? I was just another piece of the hive, another silent builder in a sea of chrome. But as I watched him establish a command perimeter, I felt a sudden, sharp ache in the place where my heart used to be. 

Fifteen years. That’s what the mission clock in the corner of my vision said. I’d been gone for fifteen years, and the world I’d come back to was a graveyard.

But as I looked at the flickering holographic display on a nearby comms-tower, the words didn't match my count. 

**"CELEBRATING ONE THOUSAND YEARS OF ARCHIVIST JUSTICE,"** the text scrolled in bright, stable letters. **"A MILLENNIUM SINCE THE ROOTS OF THE OLD WORLD WERE PURIFIED."**

I stared at the numbers. My Aether-Drive, cracked but still functioning, gave a discordant ping. *Error: Timeline mismatch. Discovered: 15.02 years since Mission 0 termination.*

They were lying. They had erased fifteen years of history and replaced it with an ocean of time. They hadn't just built a city; they had built a tomb for the TRUTH.
