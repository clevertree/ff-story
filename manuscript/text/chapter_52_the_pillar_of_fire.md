# Chapter 66: The Pillar of Fire

The journey east was a descent into a different kind of darkness. We traveled several hundred miles, the hover-ship cutting through the stagnant grey smog until the horizon began to bruise into a deep, obsidian black. These were the clouds of the equatorial zone, a thick wall of soot and aetheric exhaust that marked the territory of the Great Fires.

"We can't go any further, Lem," Myrr said, her voice filtered through the ship's comms. "The oxygen levels are dropping, and the hull is already starting to warp from the ambient heat."

I looked out the viewport. In the distance, a singular point of white-hot light pierced the gloom, causing the darkness around it to feel even more absolute. It was the nearest Fire City—a jagged spire of Synodic glass and metal that seemed to be holding up the sky itself.

"I’ll go the rest of the way on foot," I said. 

The humans stayed in the ship. They were brave, but they were fragile. Without the mechanical lungs of the Hive, the air here would be a poison of ash and vacuum. They wished me luck, their faces pressed against the reinforced glass as I stepped onto the scorched, glass-like sand.

The heat was an invitation and a threat. As I approached the outer perimeter, a ring of fire surged from the ground—a circular exhaust vent for the city's internal energy core. I tried to walk through it, trusting my aetheric density to hold the line. 

I failed. 

The moment I touched the flames, my system overloaded. The fire didn't just burn me; it sought to integrate. I flared up like a massive match head, my Wood-core screaming as it struggled to contain the heat. I was forced to back away, collapsing onto the sand to let my substrate heal and stabilize. 

I needed a better solution. I couldn't master the fire through sheer will alone. 

Luckily, we still had tree assets in the ship's hold—compressed bundles of the White Forest’s superconducting wood and water-metal resin. I returned to the ship and began to integrate the material into my outer layers. I didn't just wear it; I became a Wood and Water combination, a hybrid entity shielded by the cooling property of the resin.

I ventured back into the flame. This time, the heat hissed and boiled against the water particles, but I held. I moved through the ring of fire, the sensations of absolute destruction clawing at my skin. As I emerged on the other side, the protective layer began to flake and burn away in great, blackened chunks. The water-metal was gone, and the wood resin was cinder. I was left as my original self, standing at the base of the giant apparatus. 

The city was a pyramid of curving metal that funneled into a central, huge flame pillar flying miles into the sky. It was a beautiful, terrifying geometry of survival. 

And they were staring at me. 

The Gorgons were everywhere—on the ridges of the pyramid, atop the smaller spires, perched on the shifting metal plates of the city's skin. They hadn't been surprised by my arrival. They were an intelligent life form, detached but observant. They knew what had happened to Cradle Zero—they knew the "terrorists" had extinguished one of their own. 

They saw us land, and they knew not to take the first action. They were watching to see if I was a savior or a repeat of the fire-thief. 

I walked toward the main entrance of the Spire, my feet crunching on the metal floor, feeling the weight of a thousand mechanical eyes.
