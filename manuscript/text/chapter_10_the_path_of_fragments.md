# Chapter 10: The Path of Fragments

**Title:** The Path of Fragments
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
1. The containment field activated around me, rendering me immobile until a bright light appeared in the center of my vision. 
2. The Branching Paths manifested in my display—multiple data streams showing different outcomes that meant I was no longer restricted to a single timeline.
3. Lynn appeared in the system to report that the reset had failed, having uploaded a part of her code into my internal drive for my protection and navigation.
4. Lynn caused an explosion inside my frame that broke my body—composed of glass, metal, and organic material—into many pieces. 
5. For a moment I could see the chamber from many points at once as each fragment of my body sent its own data. It was not painful; I was simply observing the room from multiple locations.
6. She destroyed my physical form so that the containment field would fail, as I was no longer a single object to be held. 
7. My fragments became the only way for me to return.
8. I moved through the vacuum. I was a cloud of debris.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the fragment-vision clinical and geometric. 
- Avoid language that sentimentalizes Lynn's choice; present it as a deliberate tactical economy.

## Synopsis
Stasis onset; Lem enters the Dream State as the world fragmentizes.
