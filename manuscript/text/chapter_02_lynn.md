# Chapter 2: Lynn

The military presence in my driveway was not an offering of protection, but the establishment of a perimeter. I observed the soldiers through the aperture of my front door. They moved with a practiced, mechanical efficiency, their postures suggesting a hybrid of combat readiness and institutional subordination. I recorded the identification numbers on their armored hulls, the specific frequency of their short-range transmissions, and the way the light of the setting sun glinted off the matte-black barrels of their kinetic rifles. 

They did not speak to me as they entered. They did not need to. They moved into my living room, displacing the artifacts of my suburban life—the soft-cushioned chairs, the pine coffee table—with the hard edges of tactical equipment. One soldier, whose visor remained opaque, gestured for me to sit. I complied. My internal state remained one of clinical observation; if there was fear, it was a secondary data point, a flicker of biological noise beneath the primary logging of the event.

At 4:32 PM, the woman appeared.

She did not arrive in a military vehicle. She emerged from the shadow of the armored transport, walking toward my porch with a gait that bypassed the soldiers' hierarchy entirely. She wore a heavy, dark cloak of a material that seemed to absorb the electric blue of the sky—a dense, non-reflective weave that I now recognize as Aether-shielded fabric. The soldiers did not challenge her; they did not even acknowledge her presence with a salute. They simply stepped aside, creating a vacuum in the space where she wished to be.

She entered my home and removed her hood. Her face was defined by a terrifying clarity—eyes the color of deep, cold water, and a stillness that felt like a localized atmospheric pressure. 

"Lem," she said. It was not a question.

"I have no record of our acquaintance," I replied. My voice was steady, a precise replication of the person I thought I was.

She looked at me for a long moment, her expression softening into something that looked like pity. "I know you don't. That was the point. But we've known each other a long time, Lem. We’ve spent years trying to figure out how to stop what’s happening right now."

I searched my memory—the biological one, which at that time was the only one I knew—and found nothing but the empty corridors of suburban history. "You are mistaken. I am a citizen of this district. I have a school, a job... I have a name."

"You have a label," she corrected, her voice firm again. "The label is 'Lemon.' Your life here is a script, Lem—a reset. Your memory was wiped and your body reset to infancy nearly twenty years ago just to keep you quiet. You were hidden here because the people in charge thought you were too difficult to handle. But they’ve changed their minds. Now, you’re the only chance they’ve got."

She walked toward me. I felt a seismic shift in my internal processing. It was not a physical vibration, but a distortion in my perception of the room’s magnetism. The woman—Lynn, as I would later learn to identify her—moved with a quiet confidence that made the soldiers look like children.

"I'm sorry, Lem. I really am," she said, her voice dropping an octave. "But the grid is already failing. The things on the Moon are drawing power faster than we predicted. You are the only Wood Vessel in existence. If we don’t get you to the Apex Hub, there won’t be anything left to save. We need your help, and we have no alternative."

She reached out and placed her hand on my forehead.

The sensation was a total violation of my causality. It was not pain, but a profound and unsettling wrongness. It was as if a foreign hand was reaching into my own head and pulling at the gears. I felt my consciousness expand, pushing against the boundaries of my suburban identity. The pine table, the television, the very walls of my house seemed to dissolve into a stream of data and light. 

I pulled away. It was an instinctive rejection, a biological surge to preserve the "Lem" I understood. 

"No," I said, my voice cracking for the first time. "I don't... I don't want this."

Lynn’s eyes didn't show anger, only a weary determination. "I know. You were always the one who fought it the hardest."

She tried again. This time, there was no preamble. The pressure in the air spiked. I felt the Aether-Drive within me—the dormant core of my existence—flare with a terrifying heat as she made contact. My vision fractured. I saw the room not as solid matter, but as a transparency overlaid with mission markers and tactical data. The "Lem" I had been was a thin veil, and Lynn was tearing it away.

I fought her. I struck out with a strength that should have shattered a human arm, but she didn’t budge. She was unyielding, a solid weight against my frantic, clumsy resistance. 

"I'm sorry, Lem," she whispered, her voice right against my ear. "Next time you wake up, none of this is going to feel real."

She struck the point at the base of my skull with a precision that bypassed all biological defenses. 

My memory of Chapter 2 ends at exactly 4:41:03 PM. The darkness that followed was not the absence of data, but a transition into a new mode of record-keeping.
