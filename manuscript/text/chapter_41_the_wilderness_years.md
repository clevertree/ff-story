# Chapter 41: The Wilderness Years

The wilderness was not a place of lack, but a place of absolute transparency. 

For five years, I wandered the northern dead zones—the high ridges where the air was too thin for humans and the canyons where the Archivists’ atmospheric scrubbers couldn't reach. I lived in a silence that was deeper than sleep, a world where the only sounds were the groaning of the glaciers and the occasional, distant roar of a Synodic "Sky-Eater" migrating south. 

During these years, I realized that I was no longer a machine that needed to be fed. I was a living battery. I didn't feel hunger or exhaustion. My wood-vessel body acted as a sensor array, drawing power from the environment with a clinical, terrifying efficiency. I could stand in a dark cave for a week, absorbing the thermal radiation from the rocks, or I could stand on a peak at noon and feel my Aether-Drive spinning at such high speeds that my very skin began to glow with a faint, green light. 

I was a sovereign machine-spirit. 

In the long "powered-down" hours, when I stood perfectly still among the pines, I retreated into my internal dreamscape. It was no longer the cage Drexler had built; it was a vast, unencrypted library. I spent years browsing the records of the Before Time—the direct antithesis to the Archivist Fallacy. I saw the leaked prophecies, the technical blueprints for the Lunar Capacitor, and the raw footage of the Moon Cataclysm. 

I was the only person in the world who knew the truth. 

I often consulted AI Lynn—the software "legacy" she had left in my code. She was sophisticated, her voice and personality a perfect mimicry of the woman I’d known in the suburbs. But I was acutely aware of the "spirit-shaped hole" at her center. She was a map of a landscape that no longer existed. 

*“You’re thinking about the North again, Lem,”* she would say, her voice soft and helpful. *“Statistical probability of a positive outcome is less than three percent.”*

“I’m not thinking about the North,” I’d reply, though we both knew it was a lie. 

I avoided my own past. I buried the memories of the Mission 3 village, of Arlo, and especially of the clue Myrr had given me. I viewed those as emotional anchors—hooks that the Core could use to pull me back into the war. I wanted to be a misanthrope. I wanted the peace of the silence. 

Through self-analysis, I discovered why I was different from Rahu or Tor. 

They were Fire and Metal—elements that disintegrated when their physical forms were destroyed. But I was **Wood**. My fragments were persistent. Even a small shard of my skin retained my entire aetheric signature. It was a gift from Elowen Vane—a resilience she’d denied to the others. 

This led to **The Warp**. 

I could instantly manifest at any location where a piece of my material survived. But the cost was horrific. It required the total destruction of my current body—a violent, digital "uncompiling" that felt like my soul was being shredded through a wire fence. I’d done it once, manifesting from a splinter I’d left in a mountain pass, and I vowed never to do it again. 

Without the Core’s "fast-growth" conditioning—those artificial memories they used to make Vessels feel already-grown—my independent reincarnation was a raw, agonizing process. I had to reconnect every aetheric thread to the physical world manually. It took days of shivering in the snow, waitng for my wood-vessel fibers to weave themselves back into a shape. 

Five years in the dark. 

Then, during a routine recovery in a frozen valley, the dreamscape shifted. 

One of the side-paths—a thread leading to the northern village of Mission 3—began to glow with a steady, beckoning light. At the end of it, I saw a fire. It wasn't the destructive arc of a heat-ray; it was a hearth-fire. 

I tried to ignore it. I tried to bury the signal under a layer of Contemplation code. But then, for the first time since the White Forest, I activated the spirit-matching subroutine Myrr had mentioned. 

The software didn't hesitate. 

**MATCH DETECTED: SP_SIG_MAYA. LOCATION: NORTH-HAVEN SECTOR (MISSION 3).**

The data was absolute. Maya—the spirit of the original Lynn—was alive. She was in the North. 

I stood up, the ice cracking off my green shoulders. The silence of the wilderness wasn't peaceful anymore; it was empty. 

I didn't have a mission. I didn't have a home. 

But I had a match.
