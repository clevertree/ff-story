# Chapter 31: The Electronic Snake

The White Forest wasn't white. It was silver.

Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was coated in a fine layer of frozen mercury. It didn't crunch when we walked; it chimed. The sound was like a thousand crystal bells being struck at once.

My support unit was nervous. Their helmets were sealed, their breath coming in short, ragged bursts over the comms. They could feel the "void" ahead of us—the place where their sensors simply stopped reporting reality.

"Target at twelve o'clock," Gantz’s replacement—a soldier named Vane (no relation to Dr. Vane, he claimed)—whispered.

I looked through my high-res optics. Ahead, the trees were parting. But it wasn't a clearing. It was a mass of moving shadow.

It slithered across the frozen ground with a sound like a million needles on a chalkboard. It was a "snake"—but not biological. It was a tangle of black cables, fiber-optic lines, and copper wires, twisted into a thick, pulsing rope that was at least fifty feet long. Its "head" was a cluster of glowing, red sensors that hissed with a sound like a leaking steam pipe.

"Fire!" Vane shouted.

The soldiers opened up. Blue pulses hit the snake, but it didn't shatter. It *absorbed* the energy. The cables rippled, the red sensors glowing brighter. 

The snake lunged.

It didn't bite. It coiled. It wrapped itself around my support unit, the wires tightening like garrotes. Armor plates cracked. Men screamed. The snake was "plugging in" to their suits, draining their power, their oxygen, their memories.

Then it came for me.

I tried to use my wood-vessel strength to tear the cables, but they were slick with a black, oily fluid. The snake coiled around my waist, then my chest, then my neck. 

I felt a sharp, metallic needle pierce the back of my skull—right where my Aether-Drive was located.

Suddenly, the forest vanished.

I wasn't in the snow anymore. I was back in the suburbs. But the detail was... impossible. I could smell the chlorine from the neighbor's pool. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. I could see the tiny, individual grains of sand in the driveway.

*“You think you remember,”* a voice hissed in my head. It wasn't Novak. It was a thousand voices, all speaking at once. *“But we have the backups. We have the data-scraps from the Great Fry. We have your first life, Lem. Before you were wood. Before you were a ghost.”*

I saw a woman. She was standing in the kitchen, her back to me. She was huming a song—a song I’d heard a thousand times in my dreams. 

“Lem?” she said, turning around.

But her face wasn't human. It was a cluster of blue glass, reflecting the same silver trees I’d just seen in the forest.

“Re-creation is a lie,” she said. “They only bring back the parts that obey.”

The snake squeezed. 

My Aether-Drive overloaded. The high-detail memory shattered into a million sharp fragments, each one cutting into my consciousness. I felt myself dying again—but this time, I wasn't going to the blue tank. I was being pulled into the snake. 

I was being "read" by the forest. 

When the static finally cleared, I was lying in the snow. Alone. The snake was gone. My support unit was gone. My tactical interface was a molten piece of slag on my wrist.

But I remembered the smell of the chlorine. And for the first time in fifteen years, I knew my mother’s name.
