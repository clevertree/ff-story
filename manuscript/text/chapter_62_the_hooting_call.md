# Chapter 76: The Hooting Call

The cities were a cage of light, and for the first time in twenty-five years, the light was failing. 

We watched the surveillance feeds with a mounting sense of unreality. Every Synodic life form in the desert region—the small Striders that scuttled through the dunes, the medium-sized Monoliths that we’d built in the White Forest, and even the giant, ancient tripods left over from the Moon mission—had changed their trajectory. 

They weren't hunting us anymore. They weren't patrolling the perimeter. They were heading for the cities. 

"Look at the Monoliths," Jarek said, pointing to a grainy feed from a northern Hive. "They’re getting up. They’ve been dormant in the forest for years, and now... they’re just walking."

Then the sound reached us. 

It wasn't a signal on any frequency we monitored. It was a hooting—a deep, rhythmic, deafening noise that seemed to vibrate the very ground beneath the outpost. It was a call of the wild machines, a primitive resonance that bypassed the Core’s digital encryption entirely. 

Inside the city, the effect was immediate. 

The enslaved Gorgons—the builders and maintenance workers who had been the backbone of the "Utopia"—stopped. On the screens, we saw them drop their tools in unison. They looked at the sky, their blue sensors flickering with a sudden, new clarity. 

They began to walk. 

They didn't run, and they didn't panic. They simply walked toward the nearest transport—mostly the small, automated Striders—and began to exit the city gates. The Core’s security drones didn't fire. They couldn't. It was as if the "Hooting" had overwritten their basic logic, replacing "Protect the Asset" with "Join the Call."

"It’s an uprising," I said. "They’re not attacking the city. They’re leaving it."

"But the people," Jarek said. "The civilians are still inside."

On the news broadcasts, the panic was absolute. General Tor appeared on every screen—a calm, stoic figure in a world of screaming broadcasters. 

"Everything is in order," Tor’s voice boomed across the city squares. "We have the buoys in place. We have countermeasures. Backup plans are being initiated. Stay in your homes. Evacuation points exist at the exits of the sector."

"He’s lying," I said. 

"We know," a voice said behind us. It was Myrr, his face grim as he entered the command tent. "The city folk are asking where the evacuation transports are. They’ve never left the city. They don't know that the desert is a graveyard."

On the screen, a reporter was shouting a question at a Core official. *Where are the vehicles? Why aren't the ships arriving at the evacuation points?*

Tor’s response was a chilling admission of the Core's priority. 

"The vehicles have been reconfigured," Tor said, his voice cold and unwavering. "They are now being utilized as defensive war machines for the protection of this sector. Our resources must be consolidated. The preservation of the Hive is the preservation of the species."

"He’s turned their lifeboats into guns," Jarek whispered. 

The civilians didn't understand. They were wondering how a car could be a gun, but they were starting to snap out of their deep, technological slumber. They were starting to ask why the cities had been built with only one exit. Why the power stations were designed to be lures. 

The Core responded with the only tool it had left: blame. 

The news began showing faces of engineers and designers. *Here is the man who designed your faulty evacuation plan. Here is the woman who failed to secure the Node.* They were sentencing them for "contempt of duty" in real-time, attempting to feed the people a few scapegoats while the walls closed in. 

But the "Hooting" was getting louder. The Synodic army had reached the city edge. Thousands of machines, from the smallest Strider to the largest Monolith, stood in a silent, breathing circle around the Hive. 

They weren't attacking. Not yet. They were waiting for the beacons to fall.
