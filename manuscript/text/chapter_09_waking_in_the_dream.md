# Chapter 9: Waking in the Dream

The crash didn't end with a bang; it ended with a shift. One moment I was being slammed against the vibrating metal of the bridge, and the next, the world had drifted away. I wasn't unconscious. I was... somewhere else. 

It was a dream, but more real than anything I'd ever felt. I was standing in a versions of my old living room back in the suburbs, only it was empty, the windows looking out onto a bone-white lunar sky. In my mind, I could see things I shouldn't have been able to—the heat of the fires burning in the lower decks, the way the ship's spine had snapped, the exact location of every survivor. It wasn't code. It was a feeling, like a map drawn in the back of my skull.

Then, a sudden, violent screech of metal tore me out of it.

A massive mechanical hand, blackened and burnt by the vacuum, ripped through the hull above me. It didn't grab me gently. It hauled me out with a rough, industrial efficiency that made my ribs groan. One second I was trapped in the wreckage; the next, I was being dropped onto the fine, grey dust of the Moon.

I looked up, gasping. A huge, boxy repair vehicle was hovering over me, its engines kicking up a choking cloud of regolith. It looked like a giant insect, covered in arms and cameras, its surface scarred by the same debris that had killed the *Caucasian Eagle*.

A hatch hissed open. Commander Novak climbed down, her suit dusty and scratched. Behind her came a few others, their faces pale behind their visors.

"Lem," she said, her voice sounding metallic and thin through the speakers. "You're still with us."

She didn't wait for me to answer. She told me that Lynn had seen the hit coming. She’d ordered a few people into the repair craft at the last second, skipping the lifeboats entirely. Of Lynn herself, there was no sign. When I asked where she was, Novak looked away, her eyes scanning the horizon.

"I have a message for you," Novak said, stepping closer. "From Lynn. Her ship... it took a bad hit. She lost the link. The thing she was using to move you? It's gone, Lem. You're on your own now."

The realization hit me harder than the crash. Suddenly, that heavy, invisible tether behind my eyes just... snapped. The physical weight was gone. I could move my arms, my legs, even my thoughts without that crushing pressure forcing me into line. 

I was free. 

But as I stood there in the grey dust, looking at the wreckage of our ship, the freedom felt like a lead weight in my chest. I wasn't a tool anymore; I was a boy standing in a graveyard on a dead moon, and for the first time in weeks, the next step was actually mine to take.

Novak watched me. For a second, I saw something in her eyes—a flicker of doubt, maybe even fear. They couldn't force me now. They were just people, and I was... whatever I was.

"We're moving to the提取点 (extraction point) to regroup," she said, her voice forced and steady. "The mission is still on, Lem. We need everyone. There’s a hover-bike prepped for you."

She and the others climbed back into their craft—a fast, darting thing that looked like a silver wasp. I was left standing next to a weaponized variant—a low, heavy-duty bike with fat tires and missile racks. 

As their craft lifted off, vanishing into the electric, blue-tinted haze of the sky, I was alone. The silence was absolute. I looked at the bike, then at the horizon where the Moon was still peeling itself apart. I didn't have to follow them. I could have just sat there and let the air run out.

Instead, I gripped the handle and kicked the engine to life.
