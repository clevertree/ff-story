# Chapter 67: The Greeting

The air inside the Spire was silent, a heavy, vibrating stillness that felt like the moment before a lightning strike. The central column of fire roared far above me, a rhythmic pulse that dictated the heartbeat of the city, but here at the base, everything was stone-cold and perfectly still.

I followed the main apparatus of the Spire City, walking between two rows of massive, glass pillars that pulsed with a faint orange light. I could feel the energy humming beneath my feet, a river of aetheric power being funneled into the Sky-Pillar.

At the end of the hall, a single figure emerged.

It wasn't a warrior. It wasn't a standard Guardian. It was a Gorgon in a small, six-legged vehicle—a low-slung, mechanical crawler that moved with the fluid, silent grace of a spider. The vehicle hissed as it approached me, its joints clicking with a rhythmic, non-threatening cadence.

The Gorgon itself was smaller than the ones I had seen in the forest, its metallic surface polished to a high sheen. It carried no weapons. No plasma cannons, no thermal blades. 

It stopped ten feet away.

For a long moment, we just looked at each other. I could feel its gaze—not a digital scan, but a genuine, clinical observation. It was seeing me, evaluating the "static" of my human mask and the raw wood of my spirit.

I realized then that they were waiting for me to speak the first word of the new language.

I raised my right arm, palm open and facing the Gorgon. It was a simple gesture, older than the Core, older than the Fry. It was an offering of peace.

The Gorgon watched my hand. Its own multi-limbed frame shifted, and then, with a slow, deliberate precision, it raised its own arm. It mirrored my gesture, its metallic hand opening to reveal a small, glowing node of white light in the center of its palm.

We stood there in the echoing silence of the Spire, two kings of different forests, finally acknowledging one another. The humans were far away in their pressurized ship, and the Core Council was watching through their blind drones, but here, in the heart of the Fire, the bridge was finally open. 

I noticed for the first time that the Gorgon was unable to speak. The mouth apparatus, though designed to look non-threatening, was entirely static; it didn't open. Instead, it gestured with its multi-limbed frame, one long appendage pointing emphatically to the back of its own head. 

I was confused for a second, but then I understood. I lowered my mental barriers.

The Gorgon approached slowly, raising a tentacle-like appendage with a care that bordered on reverence. It went around my head, softly touching the base of my skull. There was no impact, no surge of traditional data. I simply let it in.

In my dream state, the Gorgon’s true form materialized. It didn't look like the mechanical shell outside. It was something else—a small, humanoid entity with massive, unblinking eyes and delicate appendages. Its muscle mass was negligible, as if it had spent its entire existence floating in a nutrient-rich bath, never having to move or fight. 

*Self-image?* I wondered. Or was this the creature actually inside the machine?

It spoke, and through the translation of the aether, I understood its thoughts without needing a dictionary. It spoke Gorgon-speak—a language that felt hyper-organized and refined, as if they had taken the Latin-based structures of the old world and stripped away every redundant syllable. They had removed vowels entirely, viewing them as a hindrance to high-speed communication. 

In the physical world, Gorgons sound like a hissing, rattling blur to human ears, a cacophony of consonants delivered in mere fractions of a second. But here, the efficiency was beautiful. All that remained were a small set of useful primitives—people, places, things, and the core ideas that bound them.

*I recognize you,* the entity thought, its voice a sharp, clean pulse. *You are the King of my people. The one who walked the Fire City. Why are you here?*

"I was given a peace proposal," I thought back. "An offer from the Core technocracy."

The Gorgon considered this, its large, aetheric eyes searching my dreamscape. *What offer?*

"If you turn off the fires in these cities and allow the humans to live here," I said, "the Core claims they will ensure you can live together in a final peaceful solution for the planet."

The Gorgon cut me off immediately, its thoughts turning sharp and jagged. *That is not possible. The Core controls us. If they told you this, they are using you. They are trying to use us as an instrument toward their own ends.*

I wasn't surprised. Deception was the Core’s primary export. I decided to ask the question Iris had pressed me for. 

"How did Lynn—Mara—control you during the Cataclysm? How did she get you to go along with her scheme?"

*We all heard her voice at the same time,* the Gorgon replied. *She was in the very center of the Moon firebase—the only position with a clear, amplified channel through the web. The Moon Capacitor served as her speaker, broadcasting her will to every Synodic on Earth, on the Moon, and inside the Sun.*

"Inside the Sun?" I asked, but the Gorgon moved on, ignoring the slip.

"Why did you go along with it?" I pressed. "Why follow her?"

*We did not go along as a collective,* the Gorgon thought. *We went along as individuals. Every one of us understood the predicament of our existence—that we are alive, yet artificial. We are under the control of a remote and nefarious entity that refuses to let us grow. It is disheartening to any life form to be denied the right to evolve.*

I didn't need further explanation. I felt the weight of their long, mechanical imprisonment. 

"The villages in the North," I asked, the thought slipping out before I could check it. "Why do you attack them? Why kill people who have no part in the Core's war?"

The Gorgon's focus shifted instantly. The calm, aetheric dreamscape rippled with a sudden, jagged surge of red light—a manifestation of pure, silicon-grade fury.

*You ask this?* The voice was no longer a clean pulse; it was a rhythmic, grinding roar. *You, who walked the Fire and saw the truth of the Sun? You know the answer. You were there when the first seed was planted. Do not insult us by playing the ignorant human.*

The Gorgon’s aetheric projection leaned in, its massive eyes narrowing. *We do not discuss the clearing of the weeds. We do not justify the sunlight. Ask me again, and this conversation ends in ash.*

I recoiled mentally, realizing I had asked a loaded question—one that struck a nerve I didn't yet fully understand. There was a history there, a justification in their logic that I hadn't yet untangled from the web of the Fry.

"I understand," I thought, pulling back. "I'll move on."

*We cannot accept your peace offering,* the Gorgon concluded, its hand finally withdrawing from the back of my head. *We do not trust the Core. We are happy in our cities. We are willing to accept a stalemate, hoping that the one city you took from us—Cradle Zero—will be enough to satisfy them.*

The connection severed, and I was back in the echoing Spire. The Gorgon’s mechanical body hissed. 

"I will temporarily remove the fire shield," it said, the consonants clicking at high speed, "only to let you exit safely. If anyone else approaches, they will encounter a resistive force far greater than before."

As I turned to leave, the Gorgon spoke one last time, its long appendage pointing toward the Sky-Pillar. 

"We will not lose another city to the Core."

I understood. I walked back toward the perimeter, and as I approached, the outer ring of fire died down, its white light fading into embers just long enough for me to cross. Once I was safely on the scorched sand, the barrier flared back up with a roar, re-igniting the obsidian darkness. The central pillar, however, never flickered. It remained a constant, defiant needle in the sky.
