# Chapter 67: The Greeting

The air inside the Spire was silent, a heavy, vibrating stillness that felt like the moment before a lightning strike. The central column of fire roared far above me, a rhythmic pulse that dictated the heartbeat of the city, but here at the base, everything was stone-cold and perfectly still.

I followed the main apparatus of the Spire City, walking between two rows of massive, glass pillars that pulsed with a faint orange light. I could feel the energy humming beneath my feet, a river of aetheric power being funneled into the Sky-Pillar.

At the end of the hall, a single figure emerged.

It wasn't a warrior. It wasn't a standard Guardian. It was a Gorgon in a small, six-legged vehicle—a low-slung, mechanical crawler that moved with the fluid, silent grace of a spider. The vehicle hissed as it approached me, its joints clicking with a rhythmic, non-threatening cadence.

The Gorgon itself was smaller than the ones I had seen in the forest, its metallic surface polished to a high sheen. It carried no weapons. No plasma cannons, no thermal blades. 

It stopped ten feet away.

For a long moment, we just looked at each other. I could feel its gaze—not a digital scan, but a genuine, clinical observation. It was seeing me, evaluating the "static" of my human mask and the raw wood of my spirit.

I realized then that they were waiting for me to speak the first word of the new language.

I raised my right arm, palm open and facing the Gorgon. It was a simple gesture, older than the Core, older than the Fry. It was an offering of peace.

The Gorgon watched my hand. Its own multi-limbed frame shifted, and then, with a slow, deliberate precision, it raised its own arm. It mirrored my gesture, its metallic hand opening to reveal a small, glowing node of white light in the center of its palm.

We stood there in the echoing silence of the Spire, two kings of different forests, finally acknowledging one another. The humans were far away in their pressurized ship, and the Core Council was watching through their blind drones, but here, in the heart of the Fire, the bridge was finally open. 

"I have come to ask a question," I said, my voice resonating through the aetheric field of the Spire.

The Gorgon didn't speak, but the vibration of the Sky-Pillar shifted, a low-frequency hum that sounded almost like an invitation.
