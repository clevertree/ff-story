# Chapter 82: Mission 5: The Lunar Assault

Mission 5 began precisely as Mission 1 had twenty-five years before: with a frantic, desperate assembly of machinery and a launch into the unknown. But where Mission 1 had been the product of a unified global military, Mission 5 was the work of a disparate, awakened resistance.

The "grown" machinery of the White Forest—ships with hulls of reinforced cellulose and engine cores fueled by sap-distillate—were readied in hours. The fleet was bolstered by an influx of volunteers from the surrounding cities. They were people who had spent their lives denying technology, only to realize that the rules they obeyed were designed to keep them vulnerable. They were impressed by the resilience of the White Forest tech, even if they didn't fully understand it. Their belief in the cause was fuel enough.

"Launching from three sectors," Ku’s voice crackled over the ship's internal comms as Lem settled into the pilot's seat of the lead transport. "Coordinate the breach at the lunar horizon."

The ascent was violent. The sky, once a grey smog, was now a chaotic vortex of debris and aetheric discharge. They flew through the fragments of the moon—massive, jagged rocks the size of cities that hung suspended in the void. Flying through them wasn't the issue; it was the unpredictable debris and the arcs of lunar lightning that struck out from the shards. 

But they had anticipated this. The White Forest hulls were naturally grounding, absorbing the electrical strikes and dispersing them through their root-like circuitry. 

They breached the lunar atmosphere and saw it: the Far Side fragment. It was the largest and most stable piece of the moon, essentially a continent of rock that remained anchored in space. At its center stood the Lunar Pyramid, a massive, obsidian spire that seemed to ground the fragment itself, preventing the quakes that tore the other pieces apart.

"Landing in three... two... one," Lem announced as the transport touched down on the familiar, dusty surface.

The crew deployed instantly, mounting speeders made of the same wood-water hybrid material. They were sleeker and faster than the old military bikes, humming with a low, organic vibration. They sped across the craters, heading directly for the pyramid.

Lem had briefed everyone on the details of Mission 1. He knew the terrain, the defenses, and the traps. But he also knew that fifteen years of Core occupation meant the pyramid was no longer just a station; it was a fortress.

The first defense arrived exactly as before: plasma balls, spheres of white-hot energy, shot out from the sides of the towering lunar mountains. They curved through the thin atmosphere, homing in on the speeders.

"Wait for it," Lem commanded.

Following the plan, a group of low-level autonomous flyers—small, wooden drones—shot out ahead of the main speeder line. The plasma balls, attracted to the drones' energy signatures, veered off and struck them head-on.

The drones were engulfed in white light. But when the light faded, they were still flying. The wood-water hulls, specifically designed to withstand extreme thermal flux, remained uncharred.

"See?" one of the White Forest soldiers remarked over the radio. "I told you our trees couldn't burn."

The comment wasn't said with glee. It was cynical, a reminder of the original White Forest that had been incinerated years ago. But the pride was there, felt again in the resilience of their new machines. They speculated that the ships of Mission 1 must have been built with inferior fire-machine materials—capable of withstanding heat, but not the specific frequency of the lunar plasma. The original weapons had been designed by someone who knew exactly how to dismantle the fleet they had provided.
