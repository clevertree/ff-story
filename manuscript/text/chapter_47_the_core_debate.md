# Chapter 60: The Core Debate

Years after the fact, I managed to retrieve the surveillance logs from Cradle Zero. The Archivists had thought they’d purged the High Council’s internal records during the Great Blackout, but data of that magnitude—events that shifted the trajectory of the entire Northern Front—leaves a ghost in the aether. I can see the room now, rendered in the sharp, clinical lines of a recovered file: a chamber where the air was recirculated through seven layers of Synodic mesh, tuned to a precise humidity to protect the ancient server-stacks from the rot of time. It was a room that smelled of nothingness.

In the center of the recording, Dr. Elowen Vane appears as a figure of exhaustion. She adjusts her spectacles, the weight of twenty years under the Archivist thumb pressing down on her. Across the polished metal table sits Anton Drexler. He hasn't aged; the 'biological maintenance' protocols of the state have preserved him in his 202X form—sharp, clinical, and entirely void of the doubt that I can see vibrating in Elowen’s energy.

"The data is unequivocal," Novak says, her voice echoing in the hollow silence of the vault. I watch her tap a holographic display, projecting the Northern clusters. "The 'Arlo' signature is a match for the Maya-Spirit. Ninety-nine point nine percent convergence on the Water-Element frequency."

"And the village?" Drexler asks. His voice is a low, bored drone.

"Thriving," Novak replies. "They’re using non-digital thermal energy. They’ve built a decentralized communication network using wood-core relays. It's crude, but it’s invisible to our primary suppression grid. And they’re growing, Anton. People from the Hive Cities—mostly the Year 15 AT generation—are defecting. They’re walking into the desert and not coming back."

"A cultural contagion," Drexler says. I see his fingers drumming on the table, a rhythmic twitch that suggests he is already calculating the cost of a purge. "Induced by the presence of a rogue Vessel. We’ve seen this before. In 1971. In 202X. The Water spirit is inherently disruptive to the Metal structure."

"She’s a child of the new world," Elowen speaks up. Through the log, I can hear the tremor she’s trying to hide. "Arlo isn't Lynn. He has no memory of the Moon. He’s just a boy who wants to protect his home. If we treat him like a monster, we *make* him a monster."

Drexler turns his gaze to her. For a moment, even in the playback, the intensity of his focus is unsettling. "We aren't discussing morality, Elowen. We are discussing the stability of the Thousand-Year Fallacy. If the citizens realize that a 'god' is living in the North, the Archivists' claim to the liberation of the Moon becomes a lie. The Beacon-Network becomes a prison. We lose the narrative."

He leans forward, the hologram reflecting in his gray, unblinking eyes.

"We have three options," he continues. "Plan A: Capture. We send Rahu in to retrieve the boy. We place the spirit in cryo-stasis and let the village wither. Plan B: Consumption. We activate a Beacon-Pulse in the North. We kill the boy and 'eat' the aetheric signal before it can reincarnate. Plan C: Negotiation. We offer him a place in the Hive. We make him an Archivist."

"Negotiation with a Vessel is a fallacy in itself," Novak counters. "They don't think like we do. They are elemental forces. You don't negotiate with a flood."

"And you don't 'eat' a flood either," Elowen says. "If you kill him now, the splash-back from the Water-Element would be catastrophic. You’d trigger a localized reset that would wipe out everything within a hundred miles. Including our northern relay-stations."

The room goes silent. I recognize that silence. It is the fear of the unleashed unknown. They were afraid that the boy’s spirit—a force they could not control or contain—was more powerful than their entire technological apparatus.

"So we wait?" Drexler asks, his voice dripping with the sarcasm of a man who hates being checked. "We wait for him to grow up? To find Lem? To start the war?"

"We don't wait," Elowen says. "We send an emissary. A human one. Someone who doesn't look like a soldier or a god. Someone who can speak his language."

"A diplomatic gambit," Novak muses. "It would buy us time to finalize the Plan B Beacon-Pulse if he refuses."

Drexler looks at Elowen for a long moment. "And who would you suggest for this suicidal mission, Doctor?"

In the recording, Elowen looks at the holographic map—at the green clusters representing a world she had helped disassemble.

"I'll go," she says.

I close the file. The record is clear: this was the moment the stalemate broke, and the path to our final confrontation began. Elowen Vane, the woman who had helped design the cage, was stepping out to meet the one thing that could break it.
