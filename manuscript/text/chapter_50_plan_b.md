# Chapter 50: Plan B

Arlo's departure wasn't a farewell; it was a severance. 

He didn't ask for the "Key" or the headset. He didn't even ask for a map. He just stood up from the shell-casing bench, looked at Myrr, and then at me. His eyes were no longer the vibrant blue of the Water Vessel; they were the dark, weary brown of a man who had walked through the fire and chosen the ash. 

"Take me back to the tree-line," he said. 

The Crew hesitated, their rifles dipping. I could feel the tension in the room—the desperate, silent urge to tackle him, to tie him down, to force the "Maya" memories into his skull until he remembered his purpose. But Myrr held them back with a single, sharp look. 

"Let him go," Myrr said, his voice hollow. "A god who doesn't want to be one is just a very heavy man. We have no use for anchor-weights."

I walked Arlo back to the shore of the lake. The night was cold, the moon—that fractured, grey witness to our failure—hanging low over the granite peaks. We didn't talk. What was left to say? I’d shown him the end of the world, and he’d decided his village was still the center of it. 

When we reached the wooden gates of North-Haven, he paused. He looked at me, and for a fleeting second, his hand rested on my green shoulder. 

"I'm sorry, Lem," he whispered. "I truly am. But as long as I’m here, the village is safe. The second I become your 'Witch,' the invisible rays come for us all. I can't be both."

"Goodbye, Arlo," I said. 

He walked into the gateway, and the heavy wooden beam was lifted. The gates shut with a dull, final thud. I was alone in the dark. 

I returned to the camp to find the Crew in the middle of a civil war. 

"We're done!" one of the guards shouted, throwing his rifle onto the dirt. "Ten years! We spent ten years tracking a ghost, and the ghost just called us delusional! I’m going to the underground. I’m going to find my family."

"And then what?" Myrr barked, his face glowing in the blue stove-light. "You think the Archivists won't find the caves? You think Drexler will let a 'Free Man' live when he could have a 'Meat-Component'?"

The arguing went on for hours. Some wanted to retreat to the "New White Forest" they’d built in the deep wilderness. Others wanted to surrender to the Hive Cities. But slowly, the noise began to coalesce into a new, darker resolve. 

Myrr stood up and walked over to the table where the HID helmet sat. He looked at it for a long time, then picked it up and tossed it into the fire-pit. 

"We're done with legends," he said, the blue light of the tubes melting into the orange glow of the embers. "Plan A failed. The Water Vessel is dead. So we move to the only thing we have left."

"Plan B," I said, my Aether-Drive spinning up to a combat-frequency. 

"A direct assault on **Cradle Zero**," Myrr finished, his eyes meeting mine. "We strike the Desert Base. We Strike the Fire City. We take out the heart of the Hive before they can finish the expansion."

"It’s a suicide mission," a guard said. 

"Maybe," Myrr replied, his voice regaining its steel. "But I'd rather die on my feet in the glass desert than drown in a cave. Lem, can you manifest the armor? Can you give us the strength to breach their perimeter?"

I looked at the "Blooming" trees I’d created from the hovercraft. I looked at the infinite database in my mind—the stolen blueprints for every weapon and vehicle the Core had ever built. 

"I can give you everything," I said. 

The transition was immediate. The "Crew" stopped arguing and began to gear up. They sharpened their blades, checked the scopes on their scavenged rifles, and began the cold, technical process of preparing for war. 

I was no longer a seeker of truth. I was a weapon of mass manifestation. 

As the sun began to peek over the grey horizon, marking the start of Year 26 AT, I didn't see the beckoning fire of the dream. I only saw the target. 

We were going to the desert.
