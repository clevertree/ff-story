# Chapter 68: The False Stalemate

The airlock hissed as I re-entered the White Forest ship, the residual heat from the Fire City still radiating from my synthetic skin. Myrr and the others were waiting, their faces tense with a mix of anxiety and desperate hope.

I told them everything. The Gorgon’s humanoid self-image, the hyper-efficient language of hissing consonants, and the final, cold rejection of the Core’s peace deal.

"They won't turn off the fires," I said, leaning against the navigation console. "They don't trust the Core. But they’ve accepted a stalemate. They’ll stay in their cities, and as long as we don't put out another sun, they won't hunt us."

The crew wasn't surprised. In the North, they knew that trust was something the Core had liquidated years ago. 

"We did our part," Myrr said, her voice hard. "Now let's see if Iris keeps hers."

We began our ascent, the ship’s engines roaring as we pushed through the obsidian clouds. Once we reached a safer altitude, Jarek—the other Jarek, our comms tech—initiated a long-wave transmission. We sent the signal directly to Cradle Zero, addressed to Iris Novak.

*The signal has been sent,* we messaged. *The Gorgons have accepted your truce, but not your peace deal. They won't turn the fires off. We have done our part. Release our comrade.*

I even attached a redacted transcription of the Gorgon’s thoughts—the parts that didn't reveal their internal self-image or the mention of the Sun. It was a token of transparency, a price paid for a life.

A short wait followed, the silence in the cockpit thick enough to choke on. Then, a voice cracked over the comm.

"Lem. This is Iris." She sounded tired, the weight of the Core's politics audible in her breathing. "I have received the transmission. I am sorry the deal was not accepted in full, but the Council has seen the data. I am releasing Jarek at the following coordinates outside the desert perimeter."

We followed the trail, reaching a small, disabled transport docked in the parched dunes a few miles from the city walls. We found Jarek inside—safe, though his eyes were wide with the shock of a week spent in an Archivist lab. 

He told us they had interrogated him for days. They wanted to know everything about me, about Rahu, about the "Witch" Maya and the original Lynn. He had told them everything he knew—which, thankfully, wasn't much. He hadn't known the location of our wilderness encampment, and he took a grim pride in telling them they would never find it.

"I told them they’d never penetrate our base even if they did," he whispered as we hauled him back onto our ship.

We prepared to leave, the hover-drives humming with the promise of a quiet return to the North. We had accomplished what we could. It was time to find a new place to rebuild, a base of our own.

But before we could bank the ship toward the horizon, Jarek—the comms tech—held up a hand. 

"Wait. I'm picking up a new broadcast from the city."

We all stared at the main screen. A news anchor, her face a mask of professional concern, was speaking.

"The investigation into the recent terrorist incursions has successfully concluded," she said. "We have identified the source of the hostilities that have plagued our Hive Cities."

We watched in shock. We had just brokered a stalemate. I had just spoken with Iris.

"Surveillance intel from the Strategic Sanction division confirms that the terrorists are originating not from the wilderness, but from the Northern Village settlements," the anchor continued. "The leaders of these villages, particularly the one known as Arlo, have been identified as the puppet-masters of the 'Witch' superstition. They seek to preserve a cultish, secretive tradition at the expense of global peace."

The screen showed a high-resolution surveillance photo of Arlo’s village. The same village where I had spent years.

"They are twisting the story again," Jarek hissed. "They aren't tracing us to the White Forest. They're tracing us to Arlo."

I looked at the screen, the festive lights of Cradle Zero's paradise flickering in the background. The stalemate was a lie. Or worse—Iris had been used. She had kept us busy in the Fire Cities while the Core prepared the narrative for Plan B. 

The Core was no longer united. And we had just handed them the justification they needed to burn the North to the ground.
