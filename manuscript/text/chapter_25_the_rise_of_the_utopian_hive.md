# Chapter 25: The Rise of the Utopian Hive

They called the first city **New Horizon**. 

It grew out of the desert like a glass flower. In just three months, the Archivists had used the Synodic "Builders" to manifest a metropolis of shimmering towers and suspended gardens. From a distance, it looked like a paradise. The air was perfectly temperature-controlled, the water was so clear it was almost invisible, and every street was lined with trees that were always in bloom.

I stood on the balcony of my new apartment—a suite of rooms filled with sunlight and soft, synthetic fabrics. I was the "Hero of the Expansion." I had everything I’d ever wanted back in the suburbs.

But as I looked down at the street below, I saw the truth.

A group of "vetted" humans—the elites the Core had chosen to live here—were walking through a park, laughing and talking about the "dark days" before the Archivists arrived. They looked happy. They felt safe. But their every movement was being tracked by the silver cameras that followed them like hawks.

I decided to go for a walk. Not as a hero, but as a ghost. 

I used the maintenance tunnels, the long, dark corridors that ran like veins beneath the city’s skin. The air here was hot and smelled of ozone and raw, unmanaged energy. I followed a series of pulsing, blue conduits, my green boots silent on the metal floor.

I reached a junction where the city's power was being distributed. In the center of the room, a massive, cylindrical tank was humming with a high-pitched vibration. I looked inside. 

There was a Gorgon. 

It wasn't building. It wasn't moving. It was fused into the machinery, its metallic limbs stripped of their casing and wired directly into the city's processors. Its head—that polished, skeletal chrome head—was twitching in a rhythmic, agonizing pulse. It was being used as a "meat-component"—a biological-mechanical processor to handle the millions of data-points required to keep the "paradise" running.

There were hundreds of them. Fused into the walls, the elevators, the water filtration systems. The city wasn't *made* of Synodics; it was *powered* by them.

I reached out and touched the glass of the tank. The Gorgon’s whipping arms fluttered, a gesture of recognition that made my processors stall. I wasn't just looking at a slave. I was looking at what happened to a Vessel when it stopped being useful as a soldier.

"We saved them, Lem," Cassia had said. "We gave them a home."

I looked at the twitching machine in the wall. I’d helped build this place. I’d died five times to make sure these tanks were full. 

New Horizon wasn't a city. It was a gilded cage. And the only difference between the humans up in the sunlight and the Gorgons down in the dark was which side of the bars they were standing on.
