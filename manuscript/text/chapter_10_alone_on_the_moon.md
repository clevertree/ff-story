# Chapter 10: Alone on the Moon

The isolation was absolute. For the first time since Lynn had first forced her way into my mind in that suburban living room, I was truly alone with my own thoughts. Her phantom grip on my motor cortex had vanished with the wreckage of her ship, leaving me with a terrifying, unguided freedom. Yet, the mission didn't stop being real just because I could finally choose to walk away from it. The Moon was still shattering, and the base on the horizon was still the epicenter of the collapse.

I activated the hovercraft. The machine responded to my touch with a resonant hum that felt like an extension of my own nervous system—not because of a software link, but because my hands knew exactly how to find the limits of the throttle. I began to move across the lunar terrain, the grey dust rising in silent plumes behind me. My optics adjusted to the harsh, unfiltered sunlight and the long, sharp shadows of the craters.

Toward the horizon, the alien base revealed itself. It was a sprawling construction of non-human geometry, a complex of towers and power conduits that seemed to grow out of the lunar rock itself. At its center was a massive apparatus—a plasma cannon of staggering proportions, its barrel pointed at the distant, blue marble of Earth. The scale was an affront to human engineering; it was a mechanism built by entities that thought in centuries and spoke in elemental forces.

As I approached the perimeter, I encountered other pilots. They were survivors from the fleet, mounted on similar hover-bikes, organized into loose strike teams. We did not communicate via voice; we operated on a shared tactical network. To them, I was just another pilot in a flight suit. I watched them in my periphery, noting the slight tremor in a wingman’s hands and the way their movements were jerky with the kind of adrenaline that only humans feel. I wasn't just observing them for data; I was watching them because I was now one of them—a man choosing to fly into the teeth of a machine.

The base defended itself with a lethal precision. Plasma fire erupted from hidden secondary emplacements—distributed cannon arrays that fired iridescent bolts of energy. I watched the craft beside me vanish in a silent, blinding glare. There was no sound in the vacuum, only the sudden absence of a signal on my interface.

But it wasn't just cannons. Moving through the wreckage and the dust were others—thousands of them. They were spindly, three-legged machines we called Striders, their hoods twitching as they navigated the terrain. I saw the creatures inside them: skeletal, metallic heads with whipping arms that clutched at the controls. These were the Gorgons. 

They didn't look like an army. They appeared to be in a state of sheer panic, their Striders stumbling over the debris as they fled the very base we were attacking. It looked less like a defense and more like an indigenous population caught in a crossfire they didn't understand. 

They fired back, but their weapons were strange. I saw the flicker of emitters on their chassis, but no visible projectiles emerged—only a shimmering distortion in the air. Invisible heat rays. At close range, I watched a human bike melt into a puddle of slag within seconds, but from a distance, the beams seemed to dissipate, losing their focus in the vacuum.

I banked my craft, bringing my nose around to target one of the Striders. It was fragile; a single burst of my forward cannons sent it shattering into a thousand metallic shards. They were brittle, lacking the structural resilience of the Monoliths I'd seen on Earth. I dismissed them as mere mechanical automatons—disposable "Builders" caught in a war zone.

Then I saw one take a direct hit from a human missile. 

The Strider didn't just explode. It collapsed to the lunar dust, its hood twisting violently. I watched through my zoom optics as the creature inside writhed, its metallic arms beating against the ground in a motion that was unmistakably pain. It wasn't the rhythmic thrashing of a failing circuit; it was the raw, animalistic agony of a living thing being torn apart. It flared with a sudden, incandescent anger before finally shattering.

A few hundred meters away, another Strider went down, its legs buckling after a grazing hit from a plasma bolt. The pilot—a Gorgon—was thrown from the wreckage. It landed heavily but seemed to be largely intact, its metallic head glistening in the stark lunar glare. It was stranded. Without the mobility of its Strider, it could only manage a slow, rhythmic crawl, its many whipping arms digging into the grey dust as it tried to drag its weight away from the path of the approaching flight.

The lead bikes roared past it, their altitude too high to care about a grounded scavenger. I expected the rest of the fleet to do the same; the creature was no threat, a broken builder in a sea of war machines. But a bike just a dozen meters from my left flank banked suddenly. 

The pilot didn't hesitate. He loosed a single short-range missile.

The explosion was precise and devastating. The Gorgon vanished in a bloom of white heat and flying shrapnel. 

"Scrap for the heap," a voice crackled over the comms—a short, cynical snub that felt like a punch. There was no tactical reason for the kill, no mission objective met. It was an act of pure, cold revenge. I watched the pilot level out his bike and hit the thrusters, and for a moment, I didn't see a soldier. I saw a man who had lost something he could never get back, lashing out at the only thing close enough to blame.

I felt a cold knot tighten in my stomach. I had been taught they were machines. I had been told they were the enemy. But watching that one writhe, and then seeing the casual execution of its brother, I wondered for the first time if we weren't just slaughtering a species that had nowhere left to run.

I banked the hovercraft, my hyper-observant reflexes guiding me through the hailstorm of plasma. My teammates and I worked to identify the source of the fire. We launched coordinated missile strikes, the explosions blooming like white flowers against the dark basalt. It was my first experience of genuine combat, and I handled it with a clinical detachment that felt less like code and more like an old, buried part of my personality finally finding its purpose. 

"Target identified," the interface pulsed.

But the target was not a cannon. 

A massive heat signature emerged from behind the central tower—a signature that defied categorization by our military sensors. It broadcasted a wide-spectrum transmission, a voice that was not a sound but a resonance. I recognized it instantly, though I had no record of its frequency in my local memory.

It was Rahu, the Fire Vessel.

"You seek the center of a storm you did not name," the voice stated. It carried a fierce, incandescent heat that seemed to singe the very edges of my consciousness.

My mission interface underwent a catastrophic recalibration. The waypoints toward the base flickered and died. A new priority marker appeared, blood-red and pulsing, over the location of the Fire Vessel. The ambush was not against the base; it was against the mission itself. Rahu was standing between us and the mechanism of the world's end, and I realized with a sudden, sharp dread that I was flying toward the only other thing in the universe like me—and this time, nobody was forcing me to fight. I was choosing to.
