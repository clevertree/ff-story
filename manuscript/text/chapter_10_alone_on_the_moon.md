# Chapter 10: Alone on the Moon

The silence was the first thing that hit me. Not just the lack of sound in the vacuum, but the absolute, terrifying quiet inside my own head. For weeks, Lynn had been a heavy, invisible presence behind my eyes, a tether that moved my legs and steered my thoughts. Now, she was just... gone. It felt like someone had cut a cord I hadn’t even realized was keeping me upright. I was standing in the grey dust, and the only voice I could hear was my own.

I kicked the hover-bike into gear. The machine didn’t just start; it roared, a deep, mechanical growl that I felt in the bones of my hands. It didn't feel like an extension of my nervous system anymore. It felt like a beast I was trying to break, a heavy, metal weight that fought me as I throttled up. I began to skip across the lunar surface, the grey regolith rising in silent, ghostly plumes behind me.

Toward the horizon, the base revealed itself. It didn't look like anything humans had ever built. It wasn't made of steel or concrete; it looked like it had grown up out of the rock, a nightmare of sharp angles and glowing conduits. At its center was the thing we’d come for—a massive, needle-thin tower pointed straight at the blue marble of Earth. A plasma cannon so big it made the mountains around it look like pebbles.

I wasn't alone. As I skirted the edges of the craters, I saw other bikes—silver wasps darting through the long, black shadows. We weren't talking on the radios, just watching each other's signals on our visors. I could see the other pilots, their movements jerky and desperate. Some were crying; I could see the way their shoulders shook. I wasn't just observing them for data anymore. I was one of them. A terrified boy on a bike, flying into the teeth of a god.

The base didn't wait. Blue-white bolts of plasma began to stitch the sky together, silent and blinding. I watched the bike next to me simply... vanish. No explosion, no scream. Just a flash of light, and then an empty patch of black sky where a man had been a second before.

Then I saw the others.

They were everywhere, crawling through the wreckage and the dust like mechanical crabs. We called them Striders—three-legged things with twitching hoods and long, spindly arms. Inside them, I could see the pilots. Gorgons. They had skeletal, metallic heads that looked like polished chrome, and dozens of whipping tentacles that flew over the controls.

But they weren't attacking. They were running.

The Striders were stumbling over each other, tripping through the dust as they fled the base. It didn't look like an army; it looked like a village being burned to the ground. They were firing back, but their weapons didn't shoot bullets or lasers. They shot invisible heat. I watched a human bike suddenly pop and melt like a candle, the paint bubbling and the metal sagging into a puddle of slag in heartbeats. The smell of ozone and burnt plastic filled my helmet, Sharp and bitter.

I banked my bike, my fingers finding the trigger by instinct. I loosed a burst of my forward cannons, and the Strider ahead of me shattered. It didn't feel like killing a machine. It felt like breaking glass. The metal was thin and brittle, not like the heavy slabs of the Monoliths back on Earth.

Then I saw one take a direct hit from a missile.

The Strider didn't just explode. It crumpled, its legs buckling, and the pilot—the Gorgon—was thrown into the dust. I watched through my zoom, and my heart stopped. The creature was writhing. Its metallic arms were beating against the grey rock, a frantic, rhythmic movement of pure, unadulterated pain. It wasn't a circuit failing. It was the screaming agony of a living thing being torn apart.

A few hundred meters away, another Gorgon was trying to crawl away from its broken machine. It was slow, dragging its heavy, metallic head through the dust, its whipping arms digging for purchase. It wasn't a threat. It was a scavenger, a broken thing with nowhere to go.

The lead bikes roared past it, ignoring it. But then the pilot to my left—a kid no older than me, with a face white as a sheet—suddenly banked his bike.

He loosed a single, short-range rocket.

The explosion was a blinding white bloom. When the dust cleared, the Gorgon was gone. Just a black scorch mark on the grey rock.

"Scrap for the heap," a voice crackled over the comms. It was short and ugly, filled with a kind of hatred that made me feel sick. There was no reason for that kill. No mission goal. It was just an act of cold, petty revenge. For a second, I didn't see a hero. I saw a murderer.

I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. We’d been told they were monsters. We’d been told they were the enemy. But watching that one crawl, and then seeing the casual way he’d been executed... I wondered if we weren't just the ones who had brought the fire.

I banked the bike again, my reflexes guiding me through the hailstorm of plasma. My eyes were everywhere—counting the flashes, timing the reloads, finding the gaps in the fire. It was the Bourne thing again, that hyper-observance I couldn't shut off. I wasn't brave; I just knew exactly where the death was, and I moved around it.

"Target identified," my visor pulsed.

But it wasn't a cannon.

A massive signature emerged from behind the central tower—a heat bloom so bright it felt like the sun had just come down to Earth. And then came the voice. It wasn't a sound. It was a resonance that vibrated in my teeth and made the hair on my arms stand up.

It was Rahu.

"You seek the center of a storm you did not name," the voice said. It felt like a hot wind blowing through my mind, smelling of smoke and ancient metal.

My visor went crazy. The waypoints toward the tower died, replaced by a single, blood-red marker pulsing over the center of the heat. Rahu was standing between us and the end of the world. He wasn't defending the base; he was the base. And I realized, with a sudden, sharp dread, that I was flying toward the only other person in the universe who might actually understand why I was crying.
