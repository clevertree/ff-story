# Chapter 10: Alone on the Moon

The isolation was absolute. For the first time since Lynn had first forced her way into my mind in that suburban living room, I was truly alone with my own thoughts. Her phantom grip on my motor cortex had vanished with the wreckage of her ship, leaving me with a terrifying, unguided freedom. Yet, the mission didn't stop being real just because I could finally choose to walk away from it. The Moon was still shattering, and the base on the horizon was still the epicenter of the collapse.

I activated the hovercraft. The machine responded to my touch with a resonant hum that felt like an extension of my own nervous system—not because of a software link, but because my hands knew exactly how to find the limits of the throttle. I began to move across the lunar terrain, the grey dust rising in silent plumes behind me. My optics adjusted to the harsh, unfiltered sunlight and the long, sharp shadows of the craters.

Toward the horizon, the alien base revealed itself. It was a sprawling construction of non-human geometry, a complex of towers and power conduits that seemed to grow out of the lunar rock itself. At its center was a massive apparatus—a plasma cannon of staggering proportions, its barrel pointed at the distant, blue marble of Earth. The scale was an affront to human engineering; it was a mechanism built by entities that thought in centuries and spoke in elemental forces.

As I approached the perimeter, I encountered other pilots. They were survivors from the fleet, mounted on similar hover-bikes, organized into loose strike teams. We did not communicate via voice; we operated on a shared tactical network. To them, I was just another pilot in a flight suit. I watched them in my periphery, noting the slight tremor in a wingman’s hands and the way their movements were jerky with the kind of adrenaline that only humans feel. I wasn't just observing them for data; I was watching them because I was now one of them—a man choosing to fly into the teeth of a machine.

The base defended itself with a lethal precision. Plasma fire erupted from hidden secondary emplacements—distributed cannon arrays that fired iridescent bolts of energy. I watched the craft beside me vanish in a silent, blinding glare. There was no sound in the vacuum, only the sudden absence of a signal on my interface.

I banked the hovercraft, my hyper-observant reflexes guiding me through the hailstorm of plasma. My teammates and I worked to identify the source of the fire. We launched coordinated missile strikes, the explosions blooming like white flowers against the dark basalt. It was my first experience of genuine combat, and I handled it with a clinical detachment that felt less like code and more like an old, buried part of my personality finally finding its purpose. 

"Target identified," the interface pulsed.

But the target was not a cannon. 

A massive heat signature emerged from behind the central tower—a signature that defied categorization by our military sensors. It broadcasted a wide-spectrum transmission, a voice that was not a sound but a resonance. I recognized it instantly, though I had no record of its frequency in my local memory.

It was Rahu, the Fire Vessel.

"You seek the center of a storm you did not name," the voice stated. It carried a fierce, incandescent heat that seemed to singe the very edges of my consciousness.

My mission interface underwent a catastrophic recalibration. The waypoints toward the base flickered and died. A new priority marker appeared, blood-red and pulsing, over the location of the Fire Vessel. The ambush was not against the base; it was against the mission itself. Rahu was standing between us and the mechanism of the world's end, and I realized with a sudden, sharp dread that I was flying toward the only other thing in the universe like me—and this time, nobody was forcing me to fight. I was choosing to.
