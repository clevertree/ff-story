# Chapter 61: The Failing Cities

The lights of Radiant City—the third and largest of the Hive hubs—never dimmed. They were a constant, pulsating cyan that hummed at the edge of hearing, a frequency designed to soothe the nervous system and promote collective "harmony."

Jace sat on the edge of a glass-slab bench in the central plaza, his eyes fixed on the massive holographic screen that hovered over the administrative tower. The screen was currently broadcasting the "Decade of Dedication" memorial, showing images of the 202X "Liberators" standing on the edge of the Lunar Crater. 

"One thousand years of progress in twenty-five," the narrator’s voice boomed, rich with synthetic warmth. "The Archivists have secured the future. The Fire has been tamed. The Water has been brought to the desert."

It was a lie, and Jace knew it. Everyone he knew felt the same hollow sensation in their chest when they looked at the "perfect" white walls of their apartments. 

"They’re leaving again," a low voice whispered beside him. 

Jace didn't turn his head. It was Silas, a technician who worked in the aetheric-recycling plant. They weren't supposed to talk about the "Departures."

"Who?" Jace asked. 

"The Vane family. From Sector Four. Three adults, two children. They just walked past the perimeter-gates at sunrise. The Archivist guards let them go."

"Because if they stop them, it becomes a prison," Jace said. "If they let them go, it's just 'misguided migration.'"

"They're going to the North," Silas said, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and envy. "To the 'Spirit-Towns.' They say there's a boy there who can speak to the rain. They say he doesn't use a Hive-Link. He just... knows."

Jace looked at his own wrist, where the thin, silvery mesh of his Hive-Link was fused into his skin. Every morning, it greeted him with a summary of his productivity and a chemical "boost" to his serotonin levels. It told him what to eat, when to sleep, and who to trust. 

But it couldn't tell him why he felt like he was drowning in a sea of perfect, still water. 

The "Thousand-Year Fallacy" was a beautiful cage. The Archivists had rebuilt the world, but they had forgotten to put the soul back into it. The Hive Cities were systems of efficiency, but the northern villages—the "Stalemate Clusters"—were systems of life. 

"The Core is going to act," Silas continued, leaning closer. "I heard it in the plant. They’re moving the Sky-Monoliths. They’re calling it 'Project Alignment.' They want to bring the North into the grid."

"Project Alignment," Jace repeated, the words tasting like ash. "That’s what they called the Fry, isn't it?"

Jace looked up at the moon, which was just beginning to rise over the glass spires of the city. It looked like a broken pearl, beautiful and dead. For twenty years, they had been told that the Moon was their origin, their god, and their future. 

But as the rumors of the "Water Boy" in the North grew, the Moon felt farther away than ever. 

"If the boy dies," Jace said, his voice suddenly sharp, "the lights go out. I feel it, Silas. The link... it's connected to something. And if that something goes away, this whole city is just a graveyard of glass."

He stood up, his Hive-Link pulsing with a warning of "unauthorized stress." He ignored it. He walked toward the edge of the plaza, looking past the glowing towers to the dark, silent horizon of the North. 

He wasn't ready to walk into the desert yet. But for the first time in his life, he was ready to stop listening to the hum.
