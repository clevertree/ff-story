# Chapter 52: The Battle of Trees

The attack began in absolute silence. 

We didn't use engines or rotors. We didn't use pulsar-blasts. We just triggered the "severance" command, and five percent of our forest cache—roughly fifty units—detached from the matte-black trees and began to march across the desert. 

They were **Headless Striders**—small, automated tripods with oversized cannons mounted where the Gorgon pilot’s hood used to be. Beside them moved the **Wood-Grown Monoliths**, medium-sized bipedal walkers with long, powerful arms designed for structural dismantling. They didn't have souls or mission-HUDs; they were just high-density wood and sync-metal instructions. 

They moved in a wide, elegant arc toward the North-Eastern Node. I’d designed the trajectory to be as non-threatening as possible; we weren't targeting the Hive City itself. We were bypassing the glass towers and the suspended gardens entirely, heading for the shimmering monolith that sat behind them. 

But the Hive City didn't care about our geometry. 

We monitored the Archivists’ airwaves through a scavenged receiver, and the sound was a wall of panic. Frantic broadcasters were screaming about "unidentified mechanical aggressors," their voices cracking with a terror that I’d never heard in the "Age of No Want." 

"Evacuate to the bunkers!" a voice yelled over a grainy video feed of our machines marching across the dunes. "The **Terrorists** are approaching the sector! Do not engage! Do not look at the horizon!"

"Terrorists?" one of the guards asked, his voice flat. "Is that a new word for 'people who want their sun back'?"

"It’s a frame," Myrr replied, his eyes fixed on the scanner-data. "Drexler is turning us into a bogeyman. If he can make the civilians afraid of the trees, then he can justify anything he does to us."

But as we reached the five-mile mark, the confusion shifted from the city to the camp. 

There was zero military response. 

No Sentry Gorgons. No invisible heat-rays. No interceptors. The Desert Base was only ten miles away, but the Archivists were letting us walk right up to their front door without so much as a pulsar-ping. 

"Why aren't they defending?" Myrr asked, his voice dropping to a whisper. 

"Maybe they don't think fifty units are a threat," I said, though I didn't believe it. I could feel the Core watching us. I could feel the weight of their satellite eyes tracking every Headless Strider, every aetheric pulse. 

We reached the perimeter of the Node. It was a massive, shimmering monolith of silver-blue crystal, humming with a frequency so high it made my skin begin to glow. It felt like standing next to a mountain of raw, unmanaged energy. 

I’d originally planned to shoot it from a distance, to use the Striders' cannons to shatter the crystal casing. But seeing the empty desert and the panicking city, I changed the plan. 

"Plan B," I said, my voice echoing in the Crew's headsets. "Dismantle it by hand. We’re not going to be the ones who trigger the explosion."

The Wood-Grown Monoliths stepped forward. Their massive, wood-grain hands gripped the base of the Node, the sync-metal fingers digging into the silver crystal. They didn't move with the brutal speed of a machine; they moved with the patient, rhythmic logic of a root system. 

They weren't just destroying it; they were unmaking it. 

I watched through the cameras of the Striders as the first piece of the inner casing cracked. A burst of brilliant, cyan light erupted from the gap, illuminating the desert for miles. 

The silence of the Core remained absolute. 

But as the Node began to groan under the pressure, the sound of the Hive City’s sirens changed. It wasn't an evacuation alarm anymore. It was a scream of technical failure. 

We had reached the heart. And the Core was still watching.
