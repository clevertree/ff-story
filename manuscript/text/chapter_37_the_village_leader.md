# Chapter 45: The Village Leader

Descending from the forest heights was like walking backward through my own timeline. 

A mile from the village, I entered a clearing that the forest had tried—and failed—to reclaim. The pines here were charred husks, their needles long gone. In the center of the field, the three blackened skeletons of the Tripods I’d helped destroy in Mission 3 still stood, their long, spindly legs bent in a state of terminal agony. Their Synodic hulls remained eerily pristine, the silver-grey metal immune to the decade of winter snows that should have reduced them to orange dust.

This was the "fire" I’d seen in my stasis dream. 

I paused by the largest of the inert machines. This was where I had died as a Core soldier, where my wood-vessel body had exploded into a cloud of glowing splinters. I wondered if fragments of that previous version of myself were still buried beneath the soil, if the persistence of my "Wood" nature meant I was effectively haunted by my own past—not by rusted remains, but by shards that were likely still growing, spreading like a hidden fungus beneath the ash. 

I left the ash behind and reached the perimeter of North-Haven. 

The wooden gates were shut tight—a heavy, reinforced barricade of pine beams that hadn't been there a decade ago. I approached with my hands raised, showing my empty palms and my lack of technology. I was a green-skinned boy in a frayed uniform, standing in the cold shadows of the granite cliff. 

"Halt!" a voice shouted from the wall. 

A dozen bows were drawn, the iron-tipped arrows tracking my heart. The sentinels on the wall were older than the ones I remembered, their faces weathered and hard. They didn't see a hero. They saw the "Ghost Soldier"—the monster that had brought the fire to their woods a decade ago. 

A long, heavy silence followed. I stood perfectly still, my Aether-Drive idling at a frequency that I hoped felt non-threatening. 

Finally, the heavy wooden beam was lifted. The gates creaked open. 

Standing in the gateway was a man who seemed to be made of the same granite as the mountain. He was taller than I remembered, his frame lean and powerful. He was dressed in rugged, hand-woven wool and leather, devoid of any metal or tech. His face was lined with the weight of responsibility, and his eyes—once filled with an adolescent ambition—were now hard and unnervingly steady. 

Arlo. 

He didn't pull a weapon. He didn't even look surprised. He just stood there, his arms crossed over his chest, watching me with a mixture of recognition and profound caution. 

"You're late, Lem," he said. His voice was deeper now, a resonant sound that carried the authority of a leader. 

"I had some things to work through," I replied, stepping into the village square. 

The villagers gathered in the shadows of the longhouses, watching me with a fear that made my mind rattle. Arlo gestured for me to follow him into the largest hut—the council hall. 

Inside, the air smelled of peat smoke and dried herbs. Arlo sat in a heavy, wooden chair at the head of a long table and gestured for me to sit. It was clear that he wasn't just a survivor. He was the village leader—the protector of the "Patch of Five."

"You stayed," I said. 

"I realized that the 'Utopia' Drexler was building had a price I wasn't willing to pay," Arlo replied, his eyes fixed on the fire in the hearth. "While the other northern towns were falling over themselves to join the 'Hive Cities,' we stayed here. We banned the technology. We burned the manuals. We decided that being human was more important than being comfortable."

He told me about the last decade. How he’d guided these five villages to survive by becoming "invisible" to the Archivists. They’d sacrificed their dreams of science and progress to protect their history and their culture. 

"But the invisibility is wearing off," Arlo said, his voice dropping an octave. "Two of the other villages have been struck in the last month. Tripods. They don't just clear the forest anymore; they clear the people."

"Because of the beacons?" I asked. 

Arlo nodded. "We tore them down. Every single one in our territory. We refused to be part of their map. Now they’re punishing us for the defiance."

I looked at the man who had once been a tech-obsessed boy, who had wanted to build the future. He’d given up everything to preserve the past. He was the only person I’d met who understood the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" without having to be told. 

"I'm here to help, Arlo," I said. 

"I know," he replied, and for a fleeting second, I saw a flash of the boy I’d known. "But this isn't a mission for the Core. And this time, there are no more paths to follow."
