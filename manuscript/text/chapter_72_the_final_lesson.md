# Chapter 72: The Final Lesson

Winning a battle is not the same as winning a war.

I stood over Rahu’s frozen form, my breath coming in ragged, glowing gasps. Around me, the White Forest team was pressing the advantage. With the "New Rahu" neutralized, our machines were tearing into the remaining Core vehicles, driving the invasion back toward the perimeter. We were winning. We were actually doing it.

Then, the sky went white.

It wasn't a fireball or a pod. It was a pillar of pure, blinding energy that descended from the high atmosphere like the finger of a vengeful god. It struck the second village—the one to our East.

There was no explosion, only a sound like a intake of breath. The entire village, and every forest that surrounded it, erupted in a silent, towering inferno. When the light faded, there was nothing left but a crater of molten glass and a wall of fire that reached the clouds.

Everyone in the valley saw it. The horizon was a jagged line of orange and black. The victory we had just tasted turned to ash in our mouths.

"Lem! Do you hear me?" Ku’s voice crackled through the static. I wasn't wearing an earpiece, but my proximity to the aetheric line meant the shared comms pulsed directly into my awareness, a phantom whisper in the back of my skull. "The shields are useless against that. We have no way of repelling an orbital strike. If they fire again, the perimeter won't matter."

I didn't answer right away. I closed my eyes and let my spirit drift. I slipped back into that dream-state, the time-dilation of the Wood-Vessel allowing me to scan the high atmosphere. I looked for the source.

I found it. A massive satellite, or what was left of one, silhouetted against the broken edge of the Moon. It was a jagged, ugly thing of raw metal and overcharged capacitors. I mapped the energy output reading from the blast, calculating the thermal decay and the kinetic footprint. 

I snapped back to the physical world, my eyes snapping open as the orange glow of the burning village filled my vision.

"They won't fire a third time," I whispered, the words carrying through the link to Ku. "That was Plan C. That satellite was composed of the remainder of the Core's available high-energy arsenal. They just burned through their last meaningful reserve to make that shot."

"But it exposes them," Ku replied, her voice trembling. "Everyone saw that come from the Moon. They can't blame that on 'witchcraft' anymore. They’ve revealed their own hand."

I looked at the terrified faces of the villagers fleeing past me. "It doesn't matter. They’ll find a way to twist it. A 'rogue element' captured the station, or a 'system failure' triggered by our presence. By tomorrow, the Hive Cities will be told it was our fault they had to fire. They’ll cover it up completely, or rewrite the physics until the lie is more comfortable than the truth."

The calm that Arlo had spent hours building shattered in an instant. The villagers surged toward the exits of the village, their meditative states replaced by a raw, ancient panic. They screamed as they saw their neighbors vaporized in a single heartbeat. They realized finally that their doom wasn't a possibility—it was an appointment.

Only a small, collective core remained in the square. They were parents holding their children, a few elders who had no strength left to run, and Arlo. He didn't even look at the pillar of fire. He didn't interrupt his cadence.

But his tone had shifted.

He wasn't talking about the "Bright Strands" anymore. He was talking about the dark things—the massacres of the 20th century, the redacted genocides of the 21st, the times when children were used as shields and history was written in the blood of the innocent. He was contrasting their current moment with the long, agonizing record of human failure.

Cassia broke through the thinning crowd, her face streaked with tears and soot. She grabbed Arlo’s arm, shaking him.

"Arlo, please!" she screamed over the roar of the distant fire. "We have to evacuate! We can take them into the caves, into the deep woods! You’re the one who said the record has to survive! If you die here, it all dies with you!"

Arlo snapped out of his sermon for a single second. He looked at Cassia, his eyes reflecting the orange glow of the burning valley.

"What would that accomplish, Cassia?" he asked. His voice was quiet, but it carried through the chaos. "If we run to a cave, we are just waiting for a different fire. If we hide, we are just delaying the lesson."

"The children—"

"The children are learning the most important lesson of all," Arlo said, his gaze returning to the small group that remained. "They are learning that power doesn't care about the truth. I would rather they die knowing exactly how they were betrayed than live as slaves to a lie. It is better that the people learn all the lessons from this current mistake... even if they are about to die."

He let go of her hand and turned back to his audience. He began the next verse of the sermon, his voice rising to meet the sound of the approaching wind. 

Below his feet, the ground began to vibrate again. Another launch from the Moon. Another pillar of light preparing to fall.
