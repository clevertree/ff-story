# Chapter 72: The Final Lesson

Winning a battle is not the same as winning a war.

I stood over Rahu’s frozen form, my breath coming in ragged, glowing gasps. Around me, the White Forest team was pressing the advantage. With the "New Rahu" neutralized, our machines were tearing into the remaining Core vehicles, driving the invasion back toward the perimeter. We were winning. We were actually doing it.

Then, the sky went white.

It wasn't a fireball or a pod. It was a pillar of pure, blinding energy that descended from the high atmosphere like the finger of a vengeful god. It struck the second village—the one to our East.

There was no explosion, only a sound like a intake of breath. The entire village, and every forest that surrounded it, erupted in a silent, towering inferno. When the light faded, there was nothing left but a crater of molten glass and a wall of fire that reached the clouds.

Everyone in the valley saw it. The horizon was a jagged line of orange and black. The victory we had just tasted turned to ash in our mouths.

"Lem! Do you hear me?" Ku’s voice crackled through the static. I wasn't wearing an earpiece, but my proximity to the aetheric line meant the shared comms pulsed directly into my awareness, a phantom whisper in the back of my skull. "The shields are useless against that. We have no way of repelling an orbital strike. If they fire again, the perimeter won't matter."

I didn't answer right away. I closed my eyes and let my spirit drift. I slipped back into that dream-state, the time-dilation of the Wood-Vessel allowing me to scan the high atmosphere. I looked for the source.

I found it. A massive satellite, or what was left of one, silhouetted against the broken edge of the Moon. It was a jagged, ugly thing of raw metal and overcharged capacitors. I mapped the energy output reading from the blast, calculating the thermal decay and the kinetic footprint. 

I snapped back to the physical world, my eyes snapping open as the orange glow of the burning village filled my vision.

"Ku, listen to me," I said, the telemetry data still burning in my mind. "The satellite needs four to seven minutes to recharge its capacitors. We have a window."

"A window for what?" she asked.

"Evacuation," I said.

I watched as the villagers, driven by a primal survival instinct, began to scramble toward our White Forest ships. They didn't care about "digital witchcraft" anymore; they only saw the silver hulls as lifeboats. They crowded into the holds, the metal skin of the vessels groaning under the weight of the desperate. My crew didn't hesitate. The ships lifted off, their engines screaming as they fought the northern wind to carry the people outside the blast zone.

As the last transport cleared the tree line, the sky ignited again.

A second pillar of light struck the northern horizon. A second village—once a safe haven for three hundred souls—was erased from existence in a heartbeat. The shockwave rattled the glass in the square, the roar of the fire following seconds later.

I turned to Cassia. She was standing near Arlo, her face pale and illuminated by the fire.

"You need to get on the next transport," I said, my voice urgent. "Our village is next. The other two villages are still reeling from the last attacks; they aren't worth the Core's energy. We are the target."

Cassia looked at Arlo, then back at me. She didn't move toward the remaining ships. "No," she said, her voice steadying. "I'm staying."

"Cassia—"

"I've spent my whole life in the sky, Lem," she interrupted. "I'm tired of running from what we built. I’m staying with the sermon."

I looked at her, then at Arlo, then at the sky. I didn't move either. I stayed.

I sat on the ground, the vibration of the coming launch already humming through the dirt. We listened to Arlo’s voice—a lone, fragile melody against the sound of the world ending. He was talking about the end of the first age now, a story of stars falling into the sea. 

The sky began to pulse. A brilliant, blinding white started at the zenith, spreading outward until the stars themselves were drowned. For a moment, everything was light—pure, unedited light. 

And then, everything went dark.
