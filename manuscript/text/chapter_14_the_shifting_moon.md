# Chapter 14: The Shifting Moon

When Lynn dissolved into the light, the world didn't just go quiet; it seemed to hold its breath. The obsidian hall, once so solid and cold, began to hum with a frequency that made my teeth ache and my vision blur. Above us, the funnel of white light was so bright it felt like it was carving a hole right through the center of my brain.

Panic—real, ugly human panic—finally broke what was left of the soldiers. Two of them dropped their rifles and ran for the door we’d come through. They hammered on the black stone with their bare fists, screaming for the teams outside to let them out.

"Get back!" Novak’s voice boomed through the speakers. "Seal yourselves! Don't you dare move!"

"The whole Moon is coming down!" one of the guys shrieked. He was pointing up at a crack that was racing across the ceiling like a lightning bolt. "It’s unmaking itself! We’re going to die in here!"

"This pyramid is the only thing not moving!" Novak yelled back, her voice terrifyingly cold. "If you step outside, you're dead before you hit the ground. Now get back in line!"

The soldiers crawled back, their faces slick with sweat and their eyes wide with terror. They weren't wrong about the Moon. The vibrations through the floor weren't just thuds anymore; they were the groans of a world being torn apart. I could feel the rock shifting miles below us, a deep, grinding sound that felt like the end of days.

Then, beside me, the air started to ripple. Rahu was waking up.

The energy surge Lynn had started was feeding the room, and the blue cage we’d put Rahu in was starting to leak. White-blue fire was oozing through the bars like smoke.

Rahu opened his eyes. He didn't look at us. He didn't look at Tor. He just stared at the pillar of light where Lynn had been.

"Lynn?" his voice was a hollow rasp, a sound of dry wood being crushed.

There was no answer. Just the screaming hum of the machine.

"Lynn!" he roared. The fire flared with a sudden, desperate heat that made the stasis field shatter into a thousand glowing shards. He stood up, his body wavering like a reflection in a pool of water. He looked small, somehow. Desperate.

He saw what she’d done. He saw the "Great Fry" she’d started—the short-circuit that was going to sweep the planet clean. And he saw that she was gone. Not dead, but folded into the light.

"You won't have it," Rahu hissed, his fire turning a violent, blinding white. "None of you will have it!"

He didn't attack us. He didn't even look our way. In one final, suicidal leap, he threw himself into the center of the light.

The collision was like a bomb going off in my mind. As Rahu’s fire hit the pillar of light, the whole thing turned a sick, pulsating orange. The air in the room didn't just heat up; it disappeared. I watched Rahu’s body simply... fly apart. He didn't melt. He was erased, his whole being lighting up the column with a flare so bright I thought my eyes were going to melt.

Back on Earth, they’d see it for years—the "Second Sun" that bloomed in the sky for a few terrifying seconds, casting shadows in the middle of a New York night.

That was the trigger. The "Great Fry" wasn't a theory anymore. The electromagnetic pulse was screaming toward the planet, a wall of energy that would kill every computer, every phone, every wire in the world.

Then came the collapse.

The brilliance died. The humming in the floor stopped so suddenly it made my ears ring. The light in the funnel faded to a dull, dying orange. In the center of the room, a figure fell to the stone tiles. It wasn't a god anymore. It was just a man, his fire reduced to a faint, smoldering heat that barely warmed the air.

It was Rahu, but he was hollowed out. Lynn was nowhere to be seen.

"Container four! Now!" Novak’s voice was like a whip. She was already moving toward the fallen Vessel, her tablet glowing with new orders.

The soldiers, their shock finally wearing off, moved at her command. They brought out a heavy-duty stasis unit—a blue-tinted cage of energy that they slammed down over Rahu. They didn't just capture him; they boxed him, sealing him in a coffin of transparent force.

I watched them, feeling a strange sense of relief. The fire was out. The water was gone. I was still standing. I looked at Novak, waiting for her to tell me what was next. I thought maybe I’d finally earned a place in their world.

She didn't even look at me. She just pointed a finger.

"Unit W-01," she said to the team. "Containment protocol Gamma-Six. Now."

The betrayal hit me like a physical blow. I didn't even have time to move.

The soldiers turned their devices toward me. I felt a sudden, heavy pressure behind my eyes—a frequency shift that slammed into my Aether-Drive like a lead weight. My arms and legs, once so light and free, turned into stone. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. 

The dream of my "choice," the idea that I was a person standing on a moon, it all dissolved. I wasn't a hero. I wasn't even a soldier. I was a "Lemon." A piece of property being put back in its box.

As the light in my eyes began to flicker and die, the last thing I heard was the heavy, artificial silence of the pyramid. Outside, the Moon was still breaking. But in here, the quiet was absolute.
