# Chapter 11: Rahu

The moment Rahu showed himself, the war changed. He wasn't just another target; he was a living sun, a piece of the core brought up to the surface to burn us out. My visor didn't just warn me about the heat; it started to melt, the edges of the plastic curling as the thermal radiation hit us. The air in my suit became a searing, dry wind that tasted of copper and ash.

"Treacherous Prometheus!" the radios hissed, a dozen voices screaming the same name. To the soldiers, Rahu was a nightmare from a storybook—the ghost on the moon who had turned his back on humanity to set the world on fire. To me, he was something much worse. He was a brother. A version of me that had been allowed to burn white-hot while I was kept in the dark.

High above, the *Hermes*—Tor’s flagship—looked like a silver splinter against the black. I knew Tor was up there, his face as still as a statue as he watched the carnage. He was seeing his men fall like flies, his fleet being torn apart by a single man standing in a crater. 

Then, the *Hermes* began to fall.

It wasn't a crash. It was a dive. The massive ship, as big as a city block, suddenly dipped its nose and roared toward the surface. It was a move so violent it should have snapped the ship’s spine. It tore through the clouds of white lunar dust, a screaming wall of metal and fire that filled the sky.

It was an act of pure, beautiful madness.

The *Hermes* unleashed everything it had. Huge, blinding arcs of blue energy slammed into the ground where Rahu stood. Rahu fought back, his own fire rising up to meet the ship, a fountain of orange flames that licked at the hull. The air between them didn't just glow; it screamed. A high-pitched, harmonic wail of two gods trying to erase each other from the universe.

I watched the *Hermes* take hits that would have vaporized an entire city. The hull turned cherry-red, the metal bubbling and dripping into the vacuum. And still, it kept coming. Tor wasn't just commanding a ship; he was wielding a hammer. He was using the weight of ten thousand tons of steel to pin Rahu down, to give us a single, desperate second of a chance.

For the first time, I saw what Tor really was. He wasn't just a soldier. He was a sacrifice. He’d lived his whole life in service to a plan he didn’t understand, and now he was choosing to end it to save a mission that was already failing. He was choosing to die so we could take one more step.

The end was fast. A final, earth-shaking blast from the *Hermes* seemed to crack the very ground beneath them. A bloom of white light filled my visor, blinding me. When my eyes cleared, Rahu was gone. Either disintegrated or driven deep into the rock, leaving nothing but a glass-lined crater that glowed with a sick, green light.

But the *Hermes* was a ruin.

Its engines were dead, its bridge a twisted skeleton of jagged metal. It didn't fall gracefully; it tumbled, a flaming mountain of debris, toward the horizon. I heard Tor’s final transmission. It wasn't a speech. It wasn't a goodbye. Just a single, steady pulse—a mission signal that meant *I’m still here*. And then, silence.

The flagship hit the ground miles away, a silent explosion of dust and fire that I felt through the soles of my boots.

In the heavy, cold quiet that followed, Novak’s voice came over the comms. It was flat and hard, like a stone hitting ice. 

"The *Hermes* is down," she said. "The mission is still on. All units, move to the pyramid. Now."

I looked at the spot where the *Hermes* had vanished. Tor had given everything for a second of clarity. I turned my bike toward the center of the base, my heart a cold lump in my chest. I wanted to cry for him, but the mission wouldn't let me. I was a Vessel now, and Vessels didn't have time for ghosts.
