# Chapter 15: The Path of Fragments

The stasis field took me like a cold wave. One second Novak was pointing at me, and the next, a heavy, paralyzing weight slammed into my mind. My eyes were forced shut, and I couldn't even scream as the world disappeared. I was a passenger in a body that wasn't mine anymore. 

But I didn't go into the dark. I went home.

I was standing in that same suburban living room again. The sunlight was streaming through the windows, and I could smell the faint scent of lemon furniture polish. But the room was changing. The floor was cracking, and thick, glowing green roots were growing up through the carpet, weaving together to form paths that stretched out into a garden of white light.

I wasn't alone.

Lynn was there, sitting on the sofa. She didn't look like a soldier or a goddess now. She just looked like a girl, her face soft and tired. But her voice... it was everywhere. It was in the air, in the walls, in my very bones.

"The mission failed, Lem," she said. Her voice didn't sound like a radio anymore. It sounded like a memory. "I wanted to end it. I wanted to silence the world so the machines couldn't scream anymore and the Core couldn't rot. But I only caught a piece of it. We gave the world a 'Great Fry.' We broke their toys, but we left the people to find new ways to suffer."

I tried to walk toward her, but the green paths kept shifting under my feet.

"I’m gone now," she said, and as she spoke, her form began to flicker, like a candle in a draft. "The physical part of me, anyway. But I’ve left a gift for you. A piece of myself, hidden in that heavy machine behind your eyes. You’re the only one left, Lem. The only one who can remember the truth."

I felt her words—a sudden, hot rush of data that made my head throb.

"The Core lied to you," she said, her eyes boring into mine. "They told you your memory was just code. But it's not. It's seeds. You remember everything, Lem. Even when you die, the seeds will stay. That’s why they’re so afraid of you. That’s why they reset you to a baby twenty years ago—to bury you in a suburban life so you’d forget who you are."

A sudden, red flash tore through the room, making the windows rattle.

"They have you now," Lynn said, her voice getting faster, more urgent. "And they'll pull you apart to find me. I can’t let that happen."

"Lynn?" I reached out for her, but she was already fading into the light.

"I’m letting you go," she said. "I’m setting you free."

For a split second, I was back in the pyramid. I could feel the cold floor and the blue hum of the cage. But my body didn't feel like stone anymore. It felt like it was full of fire. A blinding, white light started to bleed out of my chest, so bright it turned the whole room to ash. There was no pain. Just the feeling of being stretched and stretched until I was everywhere.

I shattered.

My body didn't explode like a bomb. It burst like a seed pod. I felt myself breaking into a thousand tiny, glowing shards. And as they flew through the room, I could see through every single one of them. I saw Novak ducking for cover; I saw the soldiers shielding their eyes; I saw Rahu curled in a ball in his box.

I realized then that I wasn't in the pyramid anymore. I was in the dream, watching the real world through my own debris.

Lynn was standing in the middle of the mess, her hair blowing in a wind that wasn't there.

"You're free, Lem," she said. "But you have to wait. The world is going to change while you’re gone. It’s going to get dark."

She walked over to one of my glowing shards and touched it. "You have a gift, Lem. The others—Rahu, Tor, me—we need the Core to bring us back. We need their machines and their labs to catch our spirits and put them in new bodies. That’s how they keep us on a leash. But you... you’re Wood. You're growth."

She looked up at the thousands of eyes watching her. "You can take root anywhere. On the Moon, on the Earth, in a piece of scrap metal or a field of grass. You're the only one who is truly free. They can't keep you in a box, Lem. Not if you don't want to be there."

The light of the shards started to dim as the energy ran out. 

"Sleep now," Lynn whispered, her voice fading into the dark. "I’ll be there when you wake up. The Future is waiting, and it's forgotton everything but you."

The room, the shards, and the girl vanished. The First Wave was over.
