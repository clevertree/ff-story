# Chapter 86: The Final Transmission

Lem was alone in the massive chamber with Rahu. He stood in the center of the hall, his wood-water form flickering as he struggled to maintain cohesion. Rahu watched him approach, his own fire dimmed but still lethal.

"Don't make me destroy you too, Lem," Rahu said, his voice a low, crackling growl. 

Lem didn't answer. He just kept walking.

Rahu hesitated. He knew that the mission to reset the solar system was impossible as long as Lem was active; Lem’s aetheric signature was the only thing that could consistently disrupt the signal. But he also knew the risk of a complete system failure if two Vessels were destroyed in synchronized proximity.

"Finish him!" a voice boomed through the chamber. It was the Core, their orders echoing from the speakers in the ceiling. "Finish Lem, and we initiate the sequence!"

Rahu stood frozen. "I don't know what will happen if I destroy him," he argued back at the ceiling. "The variables—the Maya phenomenon—it could trigger a collapse before we reach the Sun."

"He's becoming sympathetic!" another voice screamed. "Destroy him! Now!"

Rahu refused again. In that moment of rebellion, his body jerked. His limbs moved with a jerky, unnatural precision. The Core had triggered a remote-control subroutine—a battle strategy they had kept on record for centuries. Rahu was being piloted like a drone, his own mind a passenger in his body.

"I’m sorry, Lem," Rahu whispered.

The Fire Vessel dashed forward. He unleashed a strike that was a perfect mirror of the one that had destroyed Tor—a concentrated burst of thermal and kinetic energy that struck Lem dead-center.

Lem flared up like a match head. But unlike Tor, his fire didn't go out. 

The flame sprouted and expanded, turning from orange to a brilliant, blinding white. It surged upward toward the top of the chamber, spinning in massive plasma circles that began to scour the obsidian walls. It was a gasoline tank in critical mass—a radioactive material that was no longer stable.

Lem could barely contain the energy. It was the "Maya Match"—the final, desperate resonance of the Wood Vessel being pushed past its limits.

He focused the raw power and directed it in a singular beam toward Rahu. In a few heartbeats of absolute, terrifying noise, the Fire Vessel was gone. He didn't disintegrate; he was erased.

The chamber fell silent. Lem’s fire slowly faded, leaving him standing in the center of the wreckage, his body reacting as if it were beginning to dissolve into shards.

The door to the inner sanctum burst open. Elowen Vane ran into the room, her face a mask of horror. "Stop, Lem! None of us have the choice to do this! You'll destroy the anchor!"

Lem looked at her, his eyes glowing with a soft, peaceful light. "Don't worry, Elowen. It’s not an end. It's an update."

He continued into the very center of the Lunar Capacitor—the nexus of all aetheric power in the solar system. As he reached the focal point, his body vanished. He didn't die; he exploded into billions of small blobs and shards of data and spirit that formed a giant, spinning vortex. 

The vortex lit up the entire interior of the pyramid, and a massive beam of white plasma shot out of the apex and into the void toward Earth.

From Lem’s perspective, inside the aetheric focus, the world changed. He could see the entire moon fragment, the entire Earth, and the entire solar system. He could feel every Synodic machine—every Gorgon in the Fire Cities, every Tripod in the forests, every tiny repair unit on the moons of Jupiter. He was connected to all of them.

He began to send a message. It was simple, short, and absolute.

Every piece of Synodic technology in the system received a complete, unencrypted record of everything that had happened since the Moon Cataclysm—the true history of Earth, the timeline of the Vessels, the secrets of the Core, and their plan for the reset.

But he didn't stop there. He included all of the secret codes Lynn had stolen—the override keys that could disable the Core’s remote compulsion. Every creature, every machine, now held a key within its own data-structure. They were free to choose their own path, free from the subroutines that had enslaved them for decades.

"I hope," Lem’s voice echoed through the aetheric net, "that a complete record of the past will prevent us from making the same mistakes in the future."

End of Transmission.
