# Chapter 73: The Aetheric Wake

The plasma shot didn't feel like death. 

In the Hive Cities, they taught us that the transition to the Bright Path was a tearing, a violent separation of the soul from the vessel. But as the white light consumed the square, as my body and Arlo’s and Cassia’s were reduced to ionized haze in less than a nanosecond, I felt only an easy, weightless slide. The roar of the fire and the scream of the wind vanished, replaced by a deep, resonant silence.

I wasn't on the Bright Path. I wasn't in the hallway of light that the Archivists used to snare us for Re-creation. 

I was in the clearing.

The dreamscape was familiar—the same shimmering, electronic sunlit patch where I had been destroyed by the snake in Mission 3. But it wasn't the same. Beyond the edges of the clearing, a loud, howling wind echoed in the distance, a sound I had never heard in the aether before. It was a rhythmic, mournful roar that seemed to be scouring the world outside my small circle of peace. 

I stood up, looking at the silver grass beneath my feet. I noticed that pieces of me—shards of the Wood-Vessel I had inhabited years ago—were still lying on the ground. They flickered with a faint green light. When the plasma had hit our village, my spirit hadn't drifted into the void; it had been pulled back to the nearest anchor. The physical remnants of my former lives were keeping me steady, acting as a spiritual lighthouse in the storm.

I felt... expanded. I closed my eyes and realized my sensations didn't stop at my own skin. I could feel every strand of Synodic technology still active in the North. I felt the silver trees shuttering in the wind, the heavy tripods still clashing in the valleys, the data-streams of our remaining fleet as they carried the villagers to safety. I was the hub of a massive, living network.

AI Lynn was no longer just a passive advisory voice. She was pulling from the absolute limit of her stolen archives, tapping into every beacon she could reach. She wasn't just using the Core’s encrypted line; she was listening to the lower-resonance vibrations of the land itself—the "analog trees" and ancient structures that acted as natural amplifiers for humanoid signatures. She was triangulating every soul that popped up on the aetheric line.

"Signal confirmed: Arlo (Water-Vessel Spirit)," AI Lynn said. Her voice was rhythmic, stripped of its usual diagnostic caution. "Re-manifesting. I am initiating the Inception Procedure."

I watched as the markers in my vision shifted. AI Lynn was sending out pulses—specific frequency signals programmed by the original Lynn and Elowen Vane. It was a failsafe, a way to guide a spirit after death before it could be lured into the "welcoming" embrace of the Core's Cradles. Most spirits, raw and untrained, would see the bright light of a restoration chamber and head straight for it, unaware they were walking into a cage. AI Lynn was providing the markers needed to navigate the storm.

"Subject is approaching the Cradle," the AI narrated. There was a clinical lack of concern in her tone. "Beginning counter-signal. Sending beacon markers... Subject is responding. Turning away from the primary trap."

The marker for Arlo's signature veered away from the blinding white light at the center of my internal map. 

"Beginning next phase of Inception," the voice continued. "Resonating with exact signature. 50% complete... 60% complete..."

She stopped abruptly. The rhythmic narration vanished, replaced by a sudden, jagged gasp.

"Lynn," AI Lynn said, but it wasn't the AI anymore. It was a conversation. "It’s been a long time."

Lynn did not seem to have time to talk. For a moment, she was an illusion, a flickering transparency in my clearing, but then the image snapped into sharp focus.

"I am no longer Arlo," she said, her voice echoing with a thousand overlapping frequencies. "I am no longer Lynn. I am Maya."

She didn't look at me. She turned away, her spirit-form merging with the massive data-stream the AI had been holding. She moved with a terrifying speed, searching through the history of the world since the Moon Cataclysm. She started at the beginning, refusing to move backward, insisting on seeing every detail of the Core's betrayal.

I watched as her form began to flicker with a dark, burning red light. She was seeing the Hive Cities. She was seeing the "Thousand-Year Fallacy." She was seeing the way they had used the Gorgons. And with every revelation, she grew angrier.

Finally, she stopped. She didn't need to see the rest of the story. She knew exactly where it ended.

"Arlo," she whispered. 

She was remembering his memories now—his life in the village, the faces of the people we had just lost, the specific heat of the plasma strike. The rage in her signature became so intense it began to scorch the edges of my clearing.

Abruptly, she left. She didn't say goodbye; she simply vanished from my dreamscape, her signal cutting a jagged line straight back toward the center of the world.

"Maya!" I shouted, but there was nobody there.

I looked around my empty mind. I had no body yet, no physical presence to use for a move, so I went deeper. I followed the aetheric path she had carved. I saw the warm, golden path to the Cradle—the one AI Lynn had warned her against—and I saw Maya's spirit heading directly for it. 

She wasn't being tricked. She was hunting. 

In a panic, I followed her into the light. If she was going back to the cage, I wasn't letting her go alone.
