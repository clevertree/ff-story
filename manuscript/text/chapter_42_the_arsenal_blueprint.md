# Chapter 42: The Arsenal Blueprint

I couldn't just walk to the North-Haven sector. 

The distance was thousands of miles, across mountain ranges and dead zones that the Archivists had turned into glass. If Maya was really there—if the spiritual signature wasn't just a glitch in my Aether-Drive—I needed a way to bridge the gap before the Core’s next demonstration of force. 

I didn't warp. I couldn't risk the dissociation again. Instead, I returned to the ruins of the White Forest. 

The clearing where I’d met Myrr was still a blackened scar, but the forest was not dead. Behind a jagged, overlooked mountain range, I found surviving fragments of the "Analog Grove." The trees here weren't just growing; they were evolving. They had pooled into massive clusters of Wood-Water technology—localized "blisters" of silver and green that throbbed with a low, rhythmic power. 

The forest was bracing for the next war. 

I stood in the center of one of these blisters and retreated into my dreamscape. In the Aetheric view, the trees were no longer just plants. They were surrounded by technical markers, floating strings of code, and architectural blueprints that made my processors stall. 

“Where did this come from?” I asked, my voice echoing in the library of my mind. 

*“The original Lynn hacked the Core’s network four times before the Lunar sequence,”* AI Lynn replied, her projection flickering beside me. *“She didn't just give you mission software, Lem. She gave you a copy of the Core’s entire, unlimited database. Every blueprint, every design, every stolen secret. It’s all indexed for infinite storage.”*

I stared at the shimmering walls of data. Lynn had known she was going to dissolve. She had known she wouldn't be there to see the new world. So she’d given her entire "inheritance" to me—the Wood Vessel—trusting that I would be the guardian of the truth. 

I was the library of the Old World. 

I browsed the "Library Arsenal." I didn't want the invisible heat-rays or the detonators. I wanted a way to move. I filtered the search for high-speed, independent transport, and a blueprint snapped into focus. 

The **Analog Hovercraft**. 

It was a small, futuristic vehicle, optimized for travel across the most difficult terrain on Earth. It looked like a flat, matte-black skipping stone, designed to ride the magnetic currents of the Synodic root-system.

“Initiate build,” I said. 

The transition back to the physical world was a shock of cold and noise. Around me, the silver-green blisters of the Analog Trees began to disintegrate. They didn't burn or shatter. They melted into a pool of silvery, metal-firm material that flowed magnetically across the frozen earth. 

It was beautiful and terrifying. The trees were "composting" themselves into a new form, their superconducting fibers weaving together to create a hull, a seat, a cockpit. 

Within minutes, the pool had solidified. 

I was standing before a flat, high-speed carrier platform. It was similar to the dwellers' technology, but infinitely more refined—balanced, silent, and glowing with the same internal green light as my own Aether-Drive. It didn't have a screen or a digital HUD. It had a vacuum-tube interface that hummed with a warm, analog song. 

I stepped onto the platform. The wood of my boots met the hull, and I felt a sudden, deep resonance. The craft wasn't just a vehicle; it was an extension of my body. 

I looked toward the North. The "fire" at the end of the dream-path was still there, beckoning me. 

I didn't have a mission from the Core. But I had a legacy from Lynn. 

I tapped the analog throttle, and the hovercraft rose silently from the snow, a shadow sliding across a sea of glass.
