# Chapter 74: The Witch's Mirror

The transition from aether to matter was a violent, crushing weight. 

I didn't arrive in the clearing. I materialized in the center of a giant, clinical capsule, my lungs suddenly filled with the dry, recycled air of the desert base. Before my eyes could even adjust to the harsh fluorescent glare, the chamber reacted. Giant metal clamps slammed shut around my wrists and ankles, pinning me against the cold inner wall of the incubation unit.

I saw the paralysis button on the main console flickering to life. Beyond the reinforced glass, a group of scientists stood in frozen silence. At the center was Anton Drexler. He wasn't smiling. He was staring at me with a look of profound, clinical suspicion.

"Check the signature," one of the technicians shouted. His voice was thin and panicked. "This isn't Maya! We were tracking the Water-Vessel signature! How is it... how is it Lem?"

Anton didn't answer immediately. He leaned forward, squinting through the glass at me. "We were just tracking Maya entering the Cradle," he said, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous rumble. "The beacons were lighting up like a Christmas tree. How is it that we saw *her* enter, but *you* came out?"

I didn't answer. I couldn't. The pressure of the clamps was already cutting into my newly-reformed hide, and the hum of the paralysis device was beginning to vibrate through the floor. I looked at Anton, my jaw set. I wanted him to know I wasn't his pawn anymore.

Anton misinterpreted my silence. He straightened up, his face hardening into a mask of indifference. "Fine. Stay there forever."

He turned on his heel and walked out of the room, gesturing for the rest of the staff to follow. "Initiate the deep-stasis protocol. I want this anomaly cauterized."

The paralysis device kicked into gear. A wave of white-hot static washed over my nervous system, threatening to pitch me back into the dark. But before the blackout could take hold, the world faulted. 

The hum of the machine changed. It didn't stop; it broke. The high-pitched whine stuttered into a series of jagged, mechanical coughs. The blue lights on the console turned a sickly, bruised violet. 

Outside the glass, the remaining staff panicked. They scrambled for their controls, but the boards were unresponsive. "It’s not taking the override!" a woman screamed. "The system is... it's turning itself off!"

The clamps around my wrists suddenly hissed and released. I fell forward, my knees hitting the floor of the capsule. I could hear the scientists arguing frantically behind the sealed windows, their voices muffled but clear enough. They were trying to contain a "spread."

I looked up and saw it.

The machine technology in this room—the very structure of the incubation chamber and the paralysis device—had been built by Synodic "Builders" under Core direction. For fifteen years, it had been perfectly obedient. But now, it was no longer listening to them. 

The machinery began to disintegrate. It didn't melt; it shattered into millions of shards and liquid globs of metal that hovered in the air. The heavy base of the capsule began to reform, chunks of metal gathering with a bitter, unstable sound. 

It gathered itself into a shape. A humanoid form began to emerge from the wreckage of the lab equipment. Its arms were clear and sharp, but its legs were a giant, expanding mold that seemed to root directly into the floor. It was a physical manifestation of pure, redirected intent.

Maya turned her head. Her eyes weren't the cold blue of Lynn's. They were a dark, burning red, reflecting the rage she had carried out of my dreamscape. 

She stared directly through the window at the scientists. 

"Evacuate!" Anton's voice boomed over the intercom, cracking with the first hint of genuine fear I had ever heard from him. "Incinrate the lab! Seal the sector and burn it! We'll rebuild."

The staff fled, their footsteps echoing down the corridor as the heavy blast doors began to slam shut.
