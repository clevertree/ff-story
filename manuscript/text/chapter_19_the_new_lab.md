# Chapter 19: The New Lab

I woke up on a screen. 

At first, I didn't know where I was. I was a collection of green lines and pulsing waves on a high-definition monitor. I could see the room through the camera mounted on the top of the terminal—a long, sterile lab filled with the smell of ozone and hospital-grade disinfectant. 

In the center of the room, two women were standing over a workbench. One of them was old—so old her skin looked like crumpled parchment. She was wearing a lab coat that seemed three sizes too big for her. Dr. Elowen Vane. The woman who had started all of this seventy years ago.

The other was younger, maybe in her twenties, with sharp, focused eyes and a face that was a softer version of the doctor’s. Cassia.

"The spikes are continuing," Cassia said, her voice quiet as she adjusted a slider on a control panel. "His data signature won't stabilize. It’s like he’s trying to dream within the buffer."

"He’s not dreaming, Cassia," Elowen replied, her voice a thin, dry rasp. "He’s remembering. No matter how many times we reset the hardware, the Wood frequency persists. It’s a biological imperative. It takes root."

She walked over to my monitor and peered at me. Her eyes were clouded with cataracts, but she looked like she could see right through the green lines and into the boy I used to be.

"Why don't we just wipe him again?" Cassia asked. She wasn't being cruel; she was being practical. To her, I was just a malfunctioning software package. "A total deep-zero."

"We can't," Elowen said, turning back to the workbench. "He’s the only record we have left of the lunar sequence. If we wipe him, we lose the blueprint for the reset. We have to... harmonize him."

For the next few days, that’s what they did. Cassia would sit at the terminal for hours, playing these low-frequency hums and strange, melodic songs through the speakers. She called them "harmonic filters." To her, she was curing me of a fever. To me, it felt like someone was trying to wash my brain with sandpaper.

But as I watched them, I realized something. They thought I was trapped in the monitor. They thought the firewall around my data was absolute. But the lab was full of other screens. The cameras, the diagnostic tools, even the lights—they were all connected. 

I was a ghost in the machine. And I was starting to realize that the machine was bigger than they knew.
