# Chapter 16: The Final Word

**Title:** The Final Word
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I watched the clearing through the Branching Paths data stream while the soldiers took Myrr away. I heard them moving. I attempted to locate Cassia, but I was intercepted.

When Anton Drexler spoke to me, he claimed that facts were only useful if they supported the current mission and that records of the past had to be deleted to make room for the future. He stated that erasing history was necessary for progress.

After giving me a message for Myrr, he activated an electrostatic stasis field around my unit and placed me in long-term stasis. The system log showed a high-energy lock and the exact time of the event.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the exchange clinical and succinct.
- Present Anton's fatalism as a pragmatic ideology rather than an abstract villainy.
- Emphasize Lem's choice to seek truth despite predictable consequences.

## Synopsis
Lem observes the aftermath of his detonation from the dream state.
