# Chapter 30: The White Forest Briefing

The transition was a violent surge of cold electricity. One moment I was a cloud of wood-splinters in a northern clearing, and the next, I was a solid weight falling onto the cold floor of a retrieval capsule. The hiss of depressurizing gas filled the room, sounding like a thousand distant whispers.

I gasped, my new lungs burning with the dry, recycled air of the desert base. The sensation of the remote detonation was still a raw, phantom ache in my consciousness—a ghost of the signal that had just ended my previous life. 

I climbed out of the capsule, my wood-vessel body feeling heavy and unfamiliar, as if the Core had built me slightly denser this time to prevent another "hesitation." The lab was silent, clinical, and devoid of any mention of Mission 3. In the eyes of the Archivists, the North was a closed file, the "anomaly" successfully erased.

Cassia Vane was waiting for me. She didn't look like a scientist today. She was wearing tactical gear—slick, black polycarbonate plates over a mesh suit. She looked like she was going into battle.

"The North was a mess, Lem," she said, her voice low. There was a flicker of something in her eyes—guilt, perhaps, or a warning she couldn't speak. "Novak is furious about the 'wild' tech sightings. She thinks there’s a network we’ve missed."

"There is," I said, wiping the blue fluid from my eyes. "They were planting things, Cassia. Not just machines. Memories."

She paused, her hand hovering over a data-pad. "That’s why you’re going back in. But this time, you’re not a 'face' for the humans. You’re the commander."

She tapped the pad, and a map of the **White Forest**—the deepest, most inaccessible part of the Arctic zone—projected into the air. "We’ve detected a massive, analog signal coming from the center of this sector. It’s a dead zone for our builders. We can't even see it from orbit. There’s something there that's... erasing us."

"And you want me to find it?"

"I want you to lead the infiltration. You’ve seen how they think, Lem. You’ve touched the roots." she looked at me, and for a second, I saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "Novak wanted to send Rahu. I told her he’d just burn it all down. We need whatever is at the center of that forest. If it's a way to mask signals, we need it for the next phase of the Hive."

She handed me a tactical interface—a wrist-slung projector that hummed with a sharp, green light. "You have tactical control over the Support Units. All of them. Use them however you need to get to the center."

I looked at the map. The White Forest was a blank space, a circle of pure white where no data existed. 

"And if Arlo is there?" I asked.

Cassia didn't look at me. She just turned toward the door. "Then he’s part of the anomaly, Lem. And anomalies don't get to have names."

I looked at the green interface on my wrist. It felt like a cuff. I was being given the power to destroy the only people who still remembered what a "human" was. 

"I won't burn it," I whispered.

But as I walked toward the hangar, my Aether-Drive pulsed with a new directive, one that didn't come from Novak or Cassia. 

*Flee. The White Forest is not a place. It is a mirror.*
# Chapter 31: The Electronic Snake

The White Forest wasn't white. It was silver.

Every tree, every bush, every blade of grass was coated in a fine layer of frozen mercury. It didn't crunch when we walked; it chimed. The sound was like a thousand crystal bells being struck at once.

My support unit was nervous. Their helmets were sealed, their breath coming in short, ragged bursts over the comms. They could feel the "void" ahead of us—the place where their sensors simply stopped reporting reality.

"Target at twelve o'clock," Gantz’s replacement—a soldier named Vane (no relation to Dr. Vane, he claimed)—whispered.

I looked through my high-res vision. Ahead, the trees were parting. But it wasn't a clearing. It was a mass of moving shadow.

It slithered across the frozen ground with a sound like a million needles on a chalkboard. It was a "snake"—but not biological. It was a tangle of black cables, fiber-optic lines, and copper wires, twisted into a thick, pulsing rope that was at least fifty feet long. Its "head" was a cluster of glowing, red optics that hissed with a sound like a leaking steam pipe.

"Fire!" Vane shouted.

The soldiers opened up. Blue pulses hit the snake, but it didn't shatter. It *absorbed* the energy. The cables rippled, the red sensors glowing brighter. 

The snake lunged.

It didn't bite. It coiled. It wrapped itself around my support unit, the wires tightening like garrotes. Armor plates cracked. Men screamed. The snake was "plugging in" to their suits, draining their power, their oxygen, their memories.

Then it came for me.

I tried to use my wood-vessel strength to tear the cables, but they were slick with a black, oily fluid. The snake coiled around my waist, then my chest, then my neck. 

I felt a sharp, metallic needle pierce the back of my skull—right where my Aether-Drive was located.

Suddenly, the forest vanished.

I wasn't in the snow anymore. I was back in the suburbs. But the detail was... impossible. I could smell the chlorine from the neighbor's pool. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. I could see the tiny, individual grains of sand in the driveway.

*“You think you remember,”* a voice hissed in my head. It wasn't Novak. It was a thousand voices, all speaking at once. *“But we have the backups. We have the memory-scraps from the Great Fry. We have your first life, Lem. Before you were wood. Before you were a ghost.”*

I saw a woman. She was standing in the kitchen, her back to me. She was huming a song—a song I’d heard a thousand times in my dreams. 

“Lem?” she said, turning around.

But her face wasn't human. It was a cluster of blue glass, reflecting the same silver trees I’d just seen in the forest.

“Re-creation is a lie,” she said. “They only bring back the parts that obey.”

The snake squeezed. 

My Aether-Drive overloaded. The high-detail memory shattered into a million sharp fragments, each one cutting into my consciousness. I felt myself dying again—but this time, I wasn't going to the blue tank. I was being pulled into the snake. 

I was being "read" by the forest. 

When the static finally cleared, I was lying in the snow. Alone. The snake was gone. My support unit was gone. My tactical interface was a molten piece of slag on my wrist.

But I remembered the smell of the chlorine. And for the first time in fifteen years, I knew my mother’s name.
# Chapter 32: The Grinding Path

The next three weeks were a blur of screaming metal and blue fluid.

I died four times. 

Each time, the Archivists would scrape my "spirit" from the Aether, patch up my wood-vessel body, and drop me back into the White Forest. They were obsessed. They didn't care about the support units anymore. They just wanted me to reach the center. 

"The snake was a gatekeeper," Novak told me during my third reconstitution. Her face was a digital projection, flickering in the blue vat. "It was checking your signature. Now that you’ve been 'tagged,' the forest will let you deeper. Keep moving."

But moving was like walking through a meat-grinder. 

The White Forest was alive with "analog" defenses. Old security drones from the pre-Fry era that had been modified with organic parts. They didn't use lasers; they used high-velocity shards of glass and clouds of corrosive gas.

I spent my days crawling through frozen maintenance ducts and scaling ice-covered cliffs. My green uniform was now a collection of rags, held together by duct tape and my own hardened sap. My hands were permanently stained with black machine-oil and red, human blood.

The "grind" began to eat at my mind. The high-detail memories the snake had triggered wouldn't go away. I’d be in the middle of a firefight, and suddenly I’d be smelling fresh-cut grass or hearing my father’s car pulling into the driveway.

The two worlds were merging. The "After Time" was becoming a transparency laid over the "Before Time."

"It’s just sensor-ghosts, Lem," Cassia said during a brief comms window. "The analog signals are interfering with your Aetheric balance. Don't let them in."

But I *wanted* them in. The ghost-suburbs were warmer than the silver forest.

I reached the center on the twenty-second day. 

The silver trees suddenly ended, as if they’d been cut by a giant’s blade. I stepped out into a clearing that shouldn't have existed. 

The air was warm—not synthetic-warm like New Horizon, but the heavy, humid heat of a summer afternoon. There was no snow. No ice. Just a field of tall, golden grass that swayed in a gentle breeze.

In the center of the clearing sat a building. It wasn't a glass tower or a stone hut. It was a bungalow. A red-brick house with white shutters and a porch swing. It was the house from my memories.

But standing on the porch was something that didn't belong in any suburb. 

It was a Gorgon. 

But it wasn't wired into a tank. It was sitting in a rocking chair, its chrome limbs resting on its knees. It was holding a book—an actual, paper book—and its skeletal head was tilted as if it was reading by the light of a sun that wasn't there.

I walked toward the porch, my boots crushing the golden grass. The sound wasn't a chime or a chime. It was just... grass.

The Gorgon looked up. Its lenses weren't glowing red or blue. They were clear, like window glass.

"You’re late, Lem," the machine said. Its voice wasn't digital static. It sounded like an old man who had spent too much time in the sun. "The tea is already cold."
