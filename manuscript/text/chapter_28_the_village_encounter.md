# Chapter 28: The Village Encounter

North-Haven wasn't a village; it was a scar. 

It was a cluster of stone huts and wooden longhouses built into the side of a granite cliff. Smoke curled from stone chimneys, smelling of peat and damp wool. There were no lights except for the orange glow of hearth-fires. It looked like a photograph from an era I was supposed to have forgotten.

As we entered the main square, the villagers came out to watch. They didn't look like the "unvetted" refugees in the South. They were solid, their skin leathery from the wind, their eyes hard and suspicious. They were holding hunting rifles and iron spears—tools that shouldn't have worked against my support unit’s armor, but they held them with a terrifying familiarity.

"Halt," a man stepped forward. He was tall, with a beard that was more grey than black. Arlo’s father. "The Archivists were told to stay at the tree-line."

"I’m here to discuss the beacon," I said, steping forward. I tried to make my voice soft, but it echoed off the stone walls like a gunshot. "The interference is disrupting the local ecosystem."

The man spat on the ground. "The 'interference' is our memory. We don't want your glass towers. We don't want your blue water that tastes of nothing."

Behind me, one of the support soldiers—a man named Gantz—shifted his weight. His rifle, a sleek, black pulsar, hummed as it tracked the man’s heart. "Step aside, old man. We’re here to clear the perimeter."

"Wait," I said, putting a hand on Gantz’s shoulder.

But it was too late. 

A young girl—no more than five—ran out from behind a woodpile, chasing a ball of tangled wire. Gantz, startled by the sudden movement, didn't think. He reacted.

There was a crack of blue light, the smell of burnt hair, and the ball of wire disintegrated in a shower of sparks. The girl screamed, falling back as the ground beneath her feet turned to glass.

The silence that followed was absolute. 

I looked at Gantz. His visor was dark, reflecting the horrified faces of the villagers. "Identify the threat," he muttered, his voice shaking.

"She’s a child," I said. My fingers were digging into his armor, my wood-vessel strength cracking the ceramic plates. 

The man—Arlo’s father—didn't move. He just looked at the patch of glass where his daughter’s toy had been. Then he looked at Arlo. 

Arlo was staring at me, his face pale. The "god" had just tried to kill his sister. 

"Get out," the man whispered. "Before the Tripods hear you."

I looked at Arlo, wanting to say something, to explain that I wasn't like Gantz. But as I opened my mouth, a sound tore through the air—a deep, metallic groan that seemed to come from the very mountain itself. It was the sound of a giant waking up.

The Tripods were singing. And they didn't sound like machines. They sounded like a funeral.
