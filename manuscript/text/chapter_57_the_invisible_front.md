# Chapter 57: The Invisible Front

The battle started as a triumph. 

We had expected a wall of metal, and instead, we found a scattering of Core vessels—mostly older-generation Striders and a few low-tier defensive ships. The Crew, fueled by years of resentment and the adrenaline of the "Analog Lem" rebirth, didn't hesitate. They tore into the Core’s formations with a ferocity that was almost beautiful. 

"They’re soft," Myrr shouted over the comms, his ship carving a path through a formation of Archivist scouts. "They’ve spent ten years hiding behind propaganda while we’ve been surviving in the ash. They don't know how to fight a war."

He was right. Our ships, grown from the dense, wood-aligned blueprints of the Infinite Database, were physically superior. Their armor absorbed the Core’s heat-rays and redistributed the energy into our own weapon-banks. In the first ten minutes of the engagement, the desert floor was littered with the smoldering remains of Archivist ships. 

We were pushing toward the first ring of towers, the massive energy barriers of Cradle Zero flickering under the sustained barrages of our automated Monoliths. 

Then the logic of the world changed. 

One of our primary flagships—the *Cypress-Three*, piloted by a veteran named Kael—was leading the second wave. I was monitoring its sensor-feed, watching it line up a shot on a defensive battery. 

The *Cypress-Three* didn't just explode. It vanished. 

There was no incoming projectile. No heat signature. No warning from the Aether-Drive. One second the ship was a gleaming, sixty-ton beast of wood and metal; the next, it was a expanding sphere of white-hot gas and shrapnel. 

"Kael!" Myrr’s voice was a ragged scream. "Report! What happened?"

Silence. 

Ten seconds later, the ship beside it, the *Willow-One*, suffered the same fate. This time, I saw it through my own high-resolution cameras. I saw the hull simply "pinch" inward at the center, as if an invisible giant had gripped it, before the internal power-core detonated. 

"We’re being targeted from the sky!" someone yelled. 

"No," I said, my Aether-Drive frantically scanning every frequency. "There’s nothing in the sky. There’s nothing on the ground. There’s nothing in the *Aether*."

The Crew’s communication net dissolved into a cacophony of panic. Ships began to break formation, their pilots firing blindly at the dust and the dunes. They were looking for an enemy they could see, a target they could lock onto. 

But the "Phantom" didn't need to be seen. 

Every thirty seconds, another of our vessels was erased. It was a clinical, rhythmic dismantling. My automated Monoliths, stripped of their human tactical oversight as the pilots retreated into the shadows of the dunes, became stationary targets. They stood there, dumbly firing at the base's shields, while the invisible hand tore them apart one by one. 

Above us, the *Iron Pillar* hung like a silver judgment. I could feel General Tor on that bridge—a man who saw this carnage as a necessary step toward a world without war. He was detached, his mind erased of everything but the mission, yet he was the most dangerous human I had ever encountered. He moved the invisible pieces of the battlefield with the precision of a master architect.

"I got him!" Myrr’s voice suddenly cut through the static. "Sector four-nine! Thermal spike! I’m dumping the pulsar core!"

I watched the sensor feed. Myrr’s ship unleashed a torrent of white-hot energy into a patch of empty sand. For a split second, the distortion cleared. I saw a black, fire-veined Gorgon body collapse, its hull melting into slag. 

"Target neutralized," someone cheered. 

But the cheer died in their throats. 

Five seconds later, a identical distortion appeared behind the *Willow-Two*. Another ship vanished. Another heat signature, identical to the first, blossomed on the scanners. 

"How?" Myrr whispered. "I killed him. I saw him melt."

"He’s not just a machine," I said, the horror of the realization settling into my code. "They’re recycling the spirit. Tor has a reincarnation loop. If the body falls, they just pull the soul back and put it in a new one. He’s undefeatable."

"Withdraw!" Myrr’s voice was cold now, the confidence replaced by a hollow realization of defeat. "All units, break engagement! Retreat to the North-Haven perimeter! Now!"

I watched the remnants of my fleet turn and flee across the sand. The Core’s defensive ships didn't even pursue us. They simply sat back, watching as we scurried away into the desert haze. 

I looked back at the towers of Cradle Zero, shimmering in the heat. There was no smoke there. No sign of damage. The "invitation" had been a trap, and we had walked into it with the arrogance of survivors who thought they had finally become the hunters. 

As the *Analog-One* crested the final ridge before the long flight north, I ran the sensor logs one last time. I slowed the footage of the *Cypress-Three*'s destruction down to a thousandth of a second. 

In that single frame of data, I saw it. 

A distortion in the air. A shimmer of heat that wasn't from the sun. And for the briefest of moments, a signature that I hadn't felt since the Moon—a signature of pure, unbridled Fire that was too precise to be a machine. 

Rahu was there. And he was invisible.
