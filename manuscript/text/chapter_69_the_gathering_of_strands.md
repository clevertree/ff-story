# Chapter 69: The Gathering of Strands

Ku and I stood over the map of the northern territories, the glowing aetheric lines of the forest border flickering in the dim light of the command center. The stalemate couldn’t last. The Core would eventually push through, and when they did, they wouldn’t come with words. 

"We have to move," I said, tracing a circle around the five primary villages. "The White Forest is our only shield. If we can sprout the pillars in a perimeter, we can create a zone they can’t bridge."

Ku, her Water-Spirit calm but focused, nodded. "The assets are ready to move. But we’re low on the primary seeds. The nursery at the base isn’t enough for a circle of this scale."

"Send the reconnaissance crew back to the original forest," I ordered. "The grounds of the first destruction. Life always finds a way to crawl back out of the ash. There will be new sprouts there, hardened by the fire. We collect every one of them and bring them north."

We wasted no time. As the heavy transport vessels—the ghosts of the old fleet—began their slow journey toward the northern peaks, I took a small crew and headed for Arlo’s village. 

We landed on the outskirts, deep in the heavy mist where the metal of our ships wouldn't offend the eye. I didn't want to arrive as a conqueror or even a soldier. I knew the weight of "digital witchcraft" in this place; I knew they saw the aetheric glow of our vessels as a curse. If we were to save them, we had to do it on their terms.

I entered the village on foot, my boots crunching on the familiar frost-covered earth. The villagers greeted me with a silent, wary respect. They knew my Spirit; they knew I had tried to protect them before. They guided me toward the center of the village, their eyes dark with a knowledge I couldn't quite grasp.

"Arlo?" I asked a woman near the well.

She simply pointed.

At the heart of the settlement, a massive crowd had gathered. They weren't preparing for war. They weren't sharpening spears or building barricades. They were sitting in a great, concentric circle, their heads bowed in meditation or tilted back to listen. In the center stood Arlo.

He looked different. The tech-obsessed boy I had met years ago was gone, replaced by a man whose presence seemed to ripple through the air itself. He wasn't shouting; his voice was a steady, rhythmic cadence that carried even in the cold wind.

As I approached, the crowd parted for me. There was no fear, no hostility—only an eerie, calm acceptance. I wondered what had changed in the time I’d been away. The threat was looming on the horizon, yet they seemed focused on something far older.

I stopped and listened. Arlo wasn't talking about the Core. He wasn't talking about the vessels or the aetheric buoys. He was talking about the Strands.

"Our sources are not in the ink that can be washed away," Arlo said, his eyes scanning the faces of his people. "They are not in the lights that can be turned off, or the code that can be rewritten by a master in a high tower. In the world they tried to build, every book was a trap. Every digital copy was a mask. They co-opted the creator, they co-opted science, art, music... even the tools themselves. They taught us that the tools were incorruptible, so we would never think to look for the corruption in our own hands."

He paused, his gaze landing on me for a fleeting second before moving on. 

"But the independent strands of human legend cannot be controlled," he continued. "They spread like the roots of the forest, moving beneath the surface, splitting and fanning out where no single authority can find them. If you can find just one of those strands today, you aren't looking at a redacted history. You are looking at a raw copy of the original story."

He spoke then of the mountain men and women—those who had chosen the harshness of the wilderness over the safety of the glass cities long before the Great Fry. 

"The media called them ghosts. They called them savages. They gave them many names, but never their tree names," Arlo’s voice grew solemn. "They spoke of them as if they were a different species entirely. And because we were told they weren't like us, we stopped believing their stories existed. But they were the keepers of the record."

He looked up at the grey sky, at the fragments of the moon that still hung there like a broken promise.

"The original religion of this world was never meant to control," Arlo said. "It was never meant to be a tool for a king or a council. It was always just a record of the past—the true past, the one that doesn't change just because someone wants to forget it."

I stood there, a Vessel of the Core, listening to a boy explain why everything I was made of was a lie. And for the first time, I didn't feel like I needed to defend the tech. I just wanted to hear the rest of the story.

I had nothing else to do but wait. My crew had already moved out, taking every scrap of asset we had—the three primary machine assets, the salvaged weaponry, the aetheric scavenge from the old lab. They were using 100% of it, forging barricades and weaving defensive creatures out of the White Forest tech. They were building a fortress out of ghosts and silver glass. 

I watched them silhouette against the darkening tree line: Ku guiding the Water-streams, the Metal Vessels working with a rhythmic, alien precision. They were preparing for an epic stand, and I was just a witness. I hoped it would be enough.
