# Chapter 20: The Long Exile

**Title:** The Long Exile
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
With no orders, I watched the local weather, seeing the snow accumulate and melt on a single branch. I watched the fire patterns on the horizon and tracked where the smoke came from.

Remaining in the area to avoid detection, I monitored the expansion of the Fire Cities and saw where new smoke columns appeared. I kept track of broken machinery and which villages were still occupied.

I stayed in one location and watched everything around me.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain quiet endurance rather than dramatic exile rhetoric.
- Use sparse details (tracks, smoke) to show the spread of the Fire Cities.
- Keep Lem's tone pragmatic and observational.

## Synopsis
Solitude and observing Rahu's influence from the shadow of the forest.
