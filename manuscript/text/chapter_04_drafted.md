# Chapter 4: Drafted

The line at the launch facility was longer than I could have imagined. I stood there, part of a crowd of three hundred and forty-two soldiers, my feet moving only when the person in front of me moved. It didn't feel like I was making a choice to stay. It felt like a heavy, invisible hand was pushing me forward, a quiet requirement to keep my place in the queue. 

The air was thick with the smell of diesel and that sharp, metallic tang you get when a machine is running too hot. Above us, the sky was a deep, starless black, hidden behind the smoke from the fires burning on the horizon. 

I reached the checkpoint at 8:12 PM. The guard looked tired. His eyes were bloodshot, and he kept rubbing his temple. He took my authorization tablet, his brow furrowing as he scrolled through whatever was on the screen. He looked up at me, then back at the tablet.

"Something's wrong here," he said, his voice scratchy. "Subject 4022—Lem? You look like you're barely out of high school, kid. This says you missed the briefing sequence. No mission orientation, no psych eval... I can’t clear a civilian teenager for boarding. Not with everything going on."

"Step out of line, 4022," he ordered, pointing to a patch of dark concrete.

Before I could even move a muscle, a woman stepped out from behind one of the armored trucks. It was Lynn. She didn’t say a word to the guard. She just walked up and slid a small, silver drive into the reader on his desk.

The screen didn't just flash; it hummed, a deep blue light filling the small booth.

"Override confirmed," the machine chirped.

The guard’s attitude skipped past confusion and went straight to a weird kind of fear. He didn’t look at the screen again. He just stepped back, lowering his rifle.

Lynn didn't even acknowledge him. She turned to me, her eyes catching the harsh glare of the floodlights. "You’re going with the 14th Strike Company," she said. Her voice was quiet, nearly lost in the thrum of the hangar. "Listen to the officers. Do what they tell you. Just... keep your eyes open, Lem. What you see on this trip is more important than almost anything else right now."

"Where exactly are we going?" I asked. My mouth seemed to find the words on its own, a quick break in the compulsion.

"To the Moon, Lem," she said. She reached into her cloak and pulled out a small, silver pin, turning it over in her fingers. "I’ll be watching the readouts. If anything goes wrong, I'll know. Don't try to wander off. You won't be able to anyway."

She turned and disappeared into the shadows of the hangar before I could say anything else. I felt a sudden, sharp loneliness as she vanished.

I was marched into the cargo bank of a massive ship—the *Caucasian Eagle*. The thing was terrifyingly large, a cathedral of iron and wires that seemed to hum with its own heartbeat. I walked through the narrow corridors, my boots clanging on the metal floor with a sound that felt way too loud.

The ship was packed. I sat in a cramped seat surrounded by men who looked just as exhausted as the guard at the gate. They spoke in whispers, their voices jagged with nerves.

"Someone said the Far Side is glowing," a soldier next to me muttered. "Like the whole base is on fire."

"It's not a fire," another replied, gripping his pack so hard his knuckles were white. "It's the Moon itself. They say it's unmaking itself."

"I called my wife before they cut the phones," a third man said, his voice trembling. "Told her we were going to be heroes. I think I was lying."

I sat there and listened to every word. I noticed the way their hands shook, the way they avoided looking at each other. I was like a ghost sitting among them, a person who shouldn't be there, recording every detail of their fear. 

At 9:45 PM, the floor began to vibrate. A low, heavy sound started deep in the ship’s belly, a hum that I could feel in my teeth. The *Caucasian Eagle* groaned, the metal plates beneath our feet straining against the weight of the world.

The hatch hissed shut. The neighborhood I’d grown up in, the cul-de-sacs and the quiet streets—they were gone. I watched the video screens as we punched through the clouds. The fires of the city became small, orange dots, then a blur, and then finally nothing but the absolute black of space. 

I was on my way to the Moon. I was a prisoner in my own body, watching a mission I didn't understand, pushed forward by a weight that didn't care how I felt.
