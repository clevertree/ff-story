# Chapter 26: The Northern Shield Briefing

The room was freezing. Dr. Novak liked it that way. She said it kept the processors from dreaming.

I sat in a chair made of molded glass, watching a hologram of the Northern Hemisphere rotate slowly. The map was dotted with red clusters—areas of "non-compliance" where the local human populations were refusing the New Horizon upgrade.

"The South is stabilized, Lem," Novak said. She looked older than she had three months ago. The skin around her eyes was tight, like paper that had been folded too many times. "But the North is... difficult. They’ve seen what we’ve built in the desert. They’re calling it the 'Glass Prison.'"

I looked at the red dots. "They’re not wrong."

Novak ignored me. She tapped a terminal, and a new icon appeared. A fire-orange sigil flickering near the Arctic Circle. "Rahu has been redeployed. He’s heading for the White Forest to establish a perimeter."

My heart did a strange, electronic flutter. "Rahu? I haven't seen him since the Pyramid."

"And you won't," she said, her voice dropping an octave. "Contact is strictly forbidden. He’s... volatile. Re-creation hasn't been as kind to his psyche as it has to yours, Lem. He remembers too much of the Fire."

I thought of the Gorgon in the tank. I wondered how many times Rahu had been wired into a processor before they let him have a body again.

"Your mission is different," Novak continued. "You are our diplomat. Our 'Human Face.' You’re going to a village called North-Haven. They have a massive stockpile of pre-Fry technology—mostly industrial stuff, but they’ve developed a way to mask their signals from our builders."

She leaned in, the blue light of the hologram reflecting in her pupils. "We need those signals gone, Lem. If they can hide from us, the whole system collapses. You’re going to be embedded with a support unit. You meet the liaison at the drop zone. A boy named Arlo."

"A boy?" I asked.

"He’s one of them. A 'primitive' who wants a way out. He thinks the Archivists are gods." She smiled, a thin, cruel expression. "Don't disappoint him."

I stood up, the glass chair humming as I broke contact. My green uniform felt heavy, like it was made of lead. 

"One more thing," Novak said as I reached the door. "The North isn't like the desert, Lem. The ground doesn't stay still. It's full of roots. Deep ones."

I looked down at my hands. My wood-vessel fingers were already turning the color of charcoal, preparing for the cold. I didn't say anything. I just walked out into the hangar, where the transport was already screaming its defiance at the sky.
