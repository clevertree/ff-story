# Chapter 15: The Northern Trial

**Title:** The Northern Trial
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We flew north while the temperature dropped, finding the people in the villages suspicious of us as they only valued tools useful for survival.

A boy named Arlo worked on electronics in secret and watched the machines closely, though the Tripods passed the village without attacking as they moved toward a different destination.

A soldier fired a weapon. The machine returned fire. The soldier was killed. Drexler gave an order to locate the survivors.

We found a pilot in the ash. His suit was torn. He did not move. Upon receiving an order to eliminate the pilot, I did not immediately trigger the weapon. Then, a high-authority signal from the Core's network overrode my motor functions. I watched my own arm raise the rifle. My unit was destroyed in the subsequent discharge.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the incident blunt and immediate.
- Focus on Lem's internal conflict without melodrama.
- Allow Arlo to be a quiet human counterpoint rather than a plot device.

## Synopsis
The Core identifies the "uncooperative" northern villages; diplomatic and military escalation begins.
