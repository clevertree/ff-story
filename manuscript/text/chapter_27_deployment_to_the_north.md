# Chapter 27: Deployment to the North

The transport was a heavy, lumbering beast called *The Iron Crow*. It didn't fly so much as it raped the air, its engine-screams shaking the very marrow of my bones.

I sat in the cargo hold, surrounded by "Support Units"—humans in bulky, black armor who looked like they’d been carved out of coal. They didn't talk. They just checked their weapons and stared at the vibrating floor. To them, I was just another piece of Archivist tech. A "specialized asset."

The temperature dropped as we crossed the 60th parallel. The condensation on the walls froze into jagged, white patterns. I felt my internal heaters kick in, a low hum in my chest that tasted like copper. 

"Three minutes to drop!" the pilot’s voice crackled over the comms.

The ramp lowered, and the world outside was a blinding, horizontal white. The *Crow* hadn't landed; it was hovering ten feet above a shelf of black rock. I stepped out, falling through the freezing air and hitting the ground with a jar that sent a spike of sharp pain up my spine.

The wind was a physical weight, smelling of pine needles and ancient, frozen rot. As the *Crow* pulled away, its engines kicking up a cloud of stinging ice, I saw a figure standing by a stack of rusted oil drums.

He was small, wrapped in a coat of patched leather and dirty fur. He was holding a handheld radio that looked older than the Great Fry itself—a bulky, plastic thing with a cracked screen.

"Are you the god?" he shouted over the wind.

I walked toward him, my green boots crunching on the permafrost. Up close, he looked about sixteen. His face was smudged with soot, his eyes wide and hungry.

"I’m Lem," I said. "You must be Arlo."

He looked at my uniform, then at my face—my human face that didn't quite move right in the cold. He reached out a gloved hand and touched the fabric of my sleeve. "Is it true? Do you live forever?"

"I keep coming back," I said. "It's not the same thing."

He didn't listen. He was already looking past me, toward the horizon where the first of our "Builders"—a massive, spider-like walker—was beginning to emerge from the blizzard. "My father says you’re here to steal our ghosts. But I told him... I told him you’re here to give us the light back."

He turned and started walking toward a line of dark trees. "The village is two miles east. North-Haven. But be careful, Lem. The Tripods... they’ve been singing again. My father says when they sing, the ground remembers what it used to be."

I followed him into the trees. My senses were picking up a rhythmic, low-frequency thrumming coming from deep beneath the roots. It wasn't a machine. It felt like a heartbeat.
