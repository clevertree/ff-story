# Chapter 21: The Aggressive Expansion Briefing

The briefing theater was a dome of black glass set deep into the foundations of the Desert Base. It was cold in there, the air smelling of recycled oxygen and used motor oil. Looking around, I saw hundreds of them—Metal Vessels. They stood in perfect, silent rows, their chrome bodies reflecting the holographic light like thousands of mirrors. They didn't move. They didn't even breathe. They were exactly what the Archivists wanted: tools that didn't ask questions.

I stood at the front, my new Wood-green body a jarring anomaly in the sea of silver. 

Cassia Vane was pacing the stage, her boots making a sharp, lonely sound on the metal floor. She was wearing a crisp, grey uniform now, her face set in a mask of professional determination. She looked like she’d spent the last week scrubbing the memory of our "contact" in the lab from her mind.

"Welcome back, Unit W-01," she said, her voice amplified by the theater’s speakers. She didn't call me Lem. Not today. "The Council has reviewed your performance. Your recovery was... unexpected, but your utility remains high. You are being redeployed immediately."

A holographic map bloomed in the center of the room. It was a projection of the equatorial dead zone—the scorched, grey wasteland that used to be the heart of the world. 

"Mission 2: Aggressive Expansion," Cassia announced. "The first wave of reconstruction has begun. We are clearing the perimeter for the first Utopian Cities. You are looking at New Horizon."

The image shifted. I saw a city of light, a place of tall, glass towers and green parks that looked like they belonged in a dream. It looked like the suburbs I’d grown up in, but magnified a thousand times, cleaned of all the dirt and the noise. It was beautiful. It was a lie.

"We are clearing the Wild Synodics," Cassia continued, her finger tracing a path through the grey desert. "The machines that have forgotten their purpose. The strategy is systematic and surgical. You will deploy in a fanning web pattern across the nearby valleys. At each coordinate, your squad will clear any wildlife—any local predators or territorial drones—that might threaten our infrastructure. Once the zone is secure, you will plant an Aetheric Buoy."

The hologram showed a small, needle-like device plunging into the sand. 

"Once active, the buoy emits a repellent signal," Cassia said. "It ensures that no Wild Synodic will ever cross into that sector again. In a matter of days, we will have cleared enough area to begin the first foundations. You will lead the scout squads. You will be our eyes and our hands."

I watched the holographic bikes—sleek, low-slung machines that looked like silver blades. Hover-bikes. My hands twitched, remembering the feel of the throttle on the Moon. For a second, the thrill of the mission almost pushed the truth out of my mind. The idea of flying across that desert, of being a hero, of building a city... it was seductive. 

But then I looked at the Metal Vessels. They weren't excited. They weren't skeptical. They were just waiting for the command.

"The Council is granting you full tactical autonomy for this phase," Cassia added, her eyes meeting mine for a fleeting second. She was trying to tell me she still trusted me, even if the Council didn't. "You are functionally immortal now, Lem. The Re-creation Protocol means you don't have to fear death. You just have to succeed."

I didn't tell her that death was a lot more complicated than a backup file. I didn't tell her that I remembered Rahu’s explosion in high-definition. I just nodded, keeping my thoughts locked behind a firewall of silence. They thought they’d wiped me. They thought I was a clean slate they could draw their new world on.

I was going to let them keep thinking that. It was the only armor I had left.
