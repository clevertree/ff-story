# Chapter 8: The Shattered Approach

The broadcast arrived not as a flicker on the monitors, but as a resonance within the very hull of the *Caucasian Eagle*. General Tor’s voice was a curated frequency—authoritative, devoid of the static of hesitation, yet carrying a weight that felt less like inspiration and more like a structural reinforcement. 

"We are the vanguard of a truth long suppressed," the voice stated. I watched the bridge crew. Their postures, previously loosened by the creeping dread of the lunar proximity, snapped into rigid alignment. Tor spoke of defense, of human values, and of a necessity that required no further explanation. It was a masterpiece of morale stabilization. For the soldiers around me, the mission was no longer a descent into the unknown; it was a deployment against a categorized enemy. To witness such a swift recalibration of the human psyche was to understand the mechanical nature of their social cohesion.

For three days, the Moon had been behaving as no celestial body should. Plasma spirals, iridescent and geometrically precise, erupted from the lunar poles. The scientific contingent aboard labeled them "displays of power," a descriptor that substituted awe for analysis. We watched these arcs through the heavy optics of the observation deck—vast, silent bridges of ionized gas that seemed to stitch the vacuum together.

Then, the stability of the celestial order ceased.

It began with a glow. Not the reflective radiance of the sun, but a thermal signature originating from beneath the lunar crust. Sensors began to scream, their digital voices overlapping in a cacophony of impossible data. The lunar surface did not merely crack; it disintegrated. 

I stood at the primary viewport as sections of the Mare Imbrium—vast, basaltic plains I had studied in the briefing—tore free from the sphere. They did not fall. They drifted upward, caught in a swirling vortex of expanding rings. These were not fragments in a gravitational descent; they were components of a secondary mechanism. 

"The rock has no magnetic property," a technician shouted, his voice cracking. "There is no field that can sustain this movement!"

He was correct according to the monographs of the Old World. Yet, I saw the moon-rock spinning, governed by a force that ignored the limitations of terrestrial physics. The briefing documents were now obsolete. The reports provided by the Core had failed to account for a reality where the moon itself was a weapon, or perhaps a shell being discarded.

Orders from the *Hermes*, Tor’s flagship, were instantaneous: "Scatter. All vessels, fire maneuvering thrusters. Evade at all costs."

The *Caucasian Eagle* groaned as its chemical rockets ignited. We were an advanced scout, built for speed and stealth, yet the debris field was a chaotic architecture. The first impact was not a sound, but a shudder that moved through my legs and into the base of my skull. A shard of lunar basalt, the size of a transport truck, had sheared through the tertiary sensor array.

Then came the second strike.

It was a structural failure of terminal proportions. The ship’s frame, a marvel of human metallurgy, surrendered to the velocity of the lunar fragments. The bridge tilted. The artificial gravity failed, then reasserted itself at a sickening angle. Alarms, previously distinct, merged into a single, continuous wail of catastrophe.

We were caught in a violent, chaotic rotation. Through the spinning viewport, the Moon no longer looked like a satellite; it was a swell of white, jagged territory, expanding until it filled every optic. I felt the vacuum-tug of a hull breach somewhere in the lower decks. 

The *Caucasian Eagle* was no longer a vessel. It was a falling object, pulled by gravity and a momentum we could no longer control. We were out of formation. We were out of the plan. We were plummeting toward the shattered surface, and the last thing I recorded before the darkness was the sight of the *Hermes*—a small, silver needle—disappearing into the cloud of debris.
