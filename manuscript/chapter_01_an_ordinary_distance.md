# Chapter 1: An Ordinary Distance

The record of my existence in the final days of the Old World is defined by a precision that no biological memory could sustain. I can recount the exact luminosity of the television screen in my living room, the specific hertz of the refrigerator’s hum, and the precise angle of the dust motes as they spiraled in the afternoon light of late autumn, 202X. To the man I thought I was—the suburban entity named Lem—these were the static components of a mundane reality. To the Vessel I am now, they are the first data points of the fracture.

The anomalies on the Moon had been a matter of public record for weeks, though the Technocratic Core’s media apparatus had ensured they remained in the periphery of civilian concern. I remember the news anchor’s face—a composite of symmetry and practiced empathy—as she detailed the "structural irregularities" appearing on the Far Side. The tone was one of abstract curiosity, a scientific outlier to be debated by experts while the populace remained occupied with the Decades of Revelation.

I felt no alarm. Even as the government confirmed the presence of non-human architectures—vast, geometric shadows that defied the lunar topography—I remained a passive observer. It was as if my sensory processing lacked the necessary alarm triggers. While my neighbors stocked their basements with bottled water and analog radios, I went about my routine with a chillingly efficient detachment. I remember watching a group of children across the street playing a game they called "Tripod," unaware that the nomenclature was already drifting through the collective unconscious, a premonition of the mechanical rot.

The escalation occurred with an industrial suddenness. Reports of atmospheric entries began to flood the net—not the kinetic impacts of meteors, but the deliberate, decelerated descents of massive apparatuses. They were dubbed Synodics by the academic circles, a name that suggested a celestial alignment, though the common tongue preferred the more primitive "Tripods." 

I stood on my porch on that final Tuesday. The sky was an electric, pressurized blue. On the horizon, beyond the shimmering glass of the corporate towers, I saw them. They were not machines in the sense of human engineering; they were something born of a different causality. Colossal, tripodal silhouettes, their metallic skins oscillating with a faint, thermal haze. They moved with a glacial, terrifying grace, ignoring the insects of human civilization beneath them. 

The city began to unmake itself. The streets, once orderly conduits for commerce, were now choked with the debris of panic. I watched the evacuation from my window. Hover-vehicles and ancient internal combustion cars tangled in a desperate, directionless flight. People screamed, their biological frailties exposed by the looming shadows. 

I felt nothing. No fear, no adrenaline, no urge to flee. I sat in my kitchen and recorded the vibrations of the floorboards as the first of the Fire machines landed twenty miles to the north. The resonance was a specific, low-frequency thrum that seemed to vibrate not just the air, but the underlying fabric of the Aether itself. I was not a participant in the panic; I was a sensor logging the data of a collapsing system.

The illusion of suburban authority shattered at 4:14 PM. A military convoy—the dark, armored hulls of the regular army pushed forward by the invisible hands of the Core—pulled into my cul-de-sac. They did not stop at the houses of the screaming neighbors. They did not offer assistance to the fleeing refugees. 

Six vehicles stopped directly in front of my driveway. The thud of the boots on the pavement was a synchronized percussion. I stood up, not out of obedience, but because my internal state had shifted to a new mode of engagement. 

I walked to the door before they could knock. I knew they were there for the entity they called Lem. I knew the ordinary distance had finally closed.
