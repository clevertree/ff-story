# Chapter 4: Drafted

The restoration of my physical presence at the launch facility was accompanied by a procedural weight that my suburban memory could not have anticipated. I stood in a line composed of three hundred and forty-two soldiers, my body maintaining a posture of rigid, unthinking compliance. The compulsion software was a subterranean force, a series of electrical imperatives that translated into the rhythmic advancement of my feet over the cracked asphalt of the staging area.

The air smelled of industrial exhaust and the sharp, ionized tang of the anti-gravity plates being warmed in the hangars. Above us, the sky had transitioned from the bruised violet of sunset to a dense, starless black, choked by the particulate matter of the First Wave's fires.

I reached the primary checkpoint at 8:12 PM. The guard, a man whose thermal signature indicated a high state of nervous activation, took the tablet from my hand. He ran my authorization code through the mission’s internal net, his brow furrowing as the data scrolled across his visor.

"authentication error," he stated. His voice was projected through an external speaker, flat and metallic. "Subject 4022—Lem. Record indicates a mandatory briefing gap. No mission orientation logged. No psychological clearance. I can’t clear you for boarding without the orientation sequence."

I stood motionless. My internal processors recorded the guard’s elevated heart rate and the specific oscillation of his kinetic rifle’s power cell. My mouth did not move to explain; the software had no instructions for negotiation. 

"Step out of line, 4022," the guard commanded.

Before I could shift my weight, a shadow detached itself from the hull of the armored transport parked behind the checkpoint. Linn approached. She did not speak to the guard. She simply placed a small, crystalline drive into the checkpoint's interface. 

The screen flashed a deep, authoritative blue—the color of the Water element’s specific resonance.

"Override confirmed," the tablet chirped. "Authorization: Level 0 Core. Priority: Absolute."

The guard’s posture collapsed from suspicion into a sudden, frantic deference. He did not look at the data again. He stepped back, his weapon lowered.

Linn did not look at the guard. She turned to me, her eyes reflecting the white glare of the facility’s floodlights. "You will embed with the 14th Strike Company," she said. Her voice was low, shielded from the soldiers around us. "You will follow the chain of command as if it were your own will. You will observe. You will listen. Your record of this mission is more valuable than the lives of the men you are standing beside."

"What is the objective?" my mouth asked. The software had permitted a single query.

"Survival is the objective, Lem," she replied. She reached into the folds of her cloak and produced a small, silver marker. "I will be monitoring your Aetheric output. If the link fractures, I will know. Do not attempt to deviate. The compulsion is not a suggestion."

She turned and walked away, disappearing into the darkness of the hangar before I could record a response. I was alone.

I was marched into the maw of the spacecraft—the *Caucasian Eagle*. The scale of the vessel was a physical assault on my suburban orientation. It was a cathedral of iron and magnetism, its internal volume illuminated by the cold radiance of Aether-conduits. I walked through the corridors of the lower decks, my boots striking the metal gratings with a sound that felt like the tolling of a bell.

The ship was alive with the sound of hundreds of humans. I sat in the assigned crash-web of the 14th Strike Company, my body assuming the posture of readiness. I was surrounded by men who spoke in hushed, jagged voices.

"They say the Far Side is completely lit up," a soldier to my left whispered. "Like the base is breathing."

"I heard the base isn't the problem," another replied. "I heard the base is just the antenna. It's the Moon itself. It's unmaking itself."

"Radioed my wife before they cut the net," a third voice joined. "Told her we were going to be heroes. Lied through my teeth. We're just the ignition sequence for whatever Iris Novak has planned."

I recorded every word. I logged the specific tremors in their voices, the way they gripped their equipment with a desperation that suggested they knew the truth despite the lack of a briefing. I was a ghost in their midst, a silent capacitor for their trauma. 

At 9:45 PM, the internal gravity shifted. The prototype anti-gravity plates beneath the deck began to hum, a sound that resonated in my very alloys. The *Caucasian Eagle* groaned as it strained against the Earth’s gravitational well. 

The hatch was sealed. The ordinary distance was not just closed; it was erased. I watched the telemetry through the company’s shared tactical feed as we pierced the clouds, the fires of the city beneath us becoming a dim, amber glow, and then a memory, and then nothing at all.
