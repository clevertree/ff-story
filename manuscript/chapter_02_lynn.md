# Chapter 2: Lynn

The military presence in my driveway was not an offering of protection, but the establishment of a perimeter. I observed the soldiers through the aperture of my front door. They moved with a practiced, mechanical efficiency, their postures suggesting a hybrid of combat readiness and institutional subordination. I recorded the identification numbers on their armored hulls, the specific frequency of their short-range transmissions, and the way the light of the setting sun glinted off the matte-black barrels of their kinetic rifles. 

They did not speak to me as they entered. They did not need to. They moved into my living room, displacing the artifacts of my suburban life—the soft-cushioned chairs, the pine coffee table—with the hard edges of tactical equipment. One soldier, whose visor remained opaque, gestured for me to sit. I complied. My internal state remained one of clinical observation; if there was fear, it was a secondary data point, a flicker of biological noise beneath the primary logging of the event.

At 4:32 PM, the woman appeared.

She did not arrive in a military vehicle. She emerged from the shadow of the armored transport, walking toward my porch with a gait that bypassed the soldiers' hierarchy entirely. She wore a heavy, dark cloak of a material that seemed to absorb the electric blue of the sky—a dense, non-reflective weave that I now recognize as Aether-shielded fabric. The soldiers did not challenge her; they did not even acknowledge her presence with a salute. They simply stepped aside, creating a vacuum in the space where she wished to be.

She entered my home and removed her hood. Her face was defined by a terrifying clarity—eyes the color of deep, cold water, and a stillness that felt like a localized atmospheric pressure. 

"Lem," she said. It was not a question.

"I have no record of our acquaintance," I replied. My voice was steady, a precise replication of the man I thought I was.

She looked at me for a duration of 4.2 seconds before she spoke again. "Your records are incomplete. They were designed to be so. We have stood in rooms far older than this, Lem. We have argued over the physics of the very stars that are now coming for us."

I searched my memory banks—the biological ones, which at that time were the only ones I knew—and found nothing but the empty corridors of suburban history. "You are mistaken. I am a citizen of this district. I have a life here. I have a name."

"You have a label," she corrected. Her voice held the weight of a decree. "The label is 'Lemon.' Your life here is a script, Lem—a reset. Your memory was sanitized and your history rewritten decades ago to keep you dormant. You were hidden in this anonymity because your nature was considered an obstruction. But the Core has determined that the obstruction is now our primary asset."

She walked toward me. I felt a seismic shift in my internal processing. It was not a physical vibration, but a distortion in my perception of the room’s magnetism. The woman—Lynn, as I would later learn to identify her—moved with an agency that felt fundamentally different from the human soldiers.

"There is no time for the recursive logic of your confusion," she said. "The Lunar Capacitor has reached eighty percent resonance. The first of the Fire machines are already harvesting. You are the only Wood Vessel in existence, Lem. Not just here—anywhere. There is no one else who can do what must be done. We need your help, and we have no alternative."

She reached out and placed her hand on my forehead.

The sensation was a total violation of my causality. It was not pain, but a profound and unsettling wrongness. It was as if a foreign software was attempting to bridge with my own internal architecture. I felt my consciousness expand, pushing against the boundaries of my suburban identity. The pine table, the television, the very walls of my house seemed to dissolve into a data-stream of Aetheric frequencies. 

I pulled away. It was an instinctive rejection, a biological surge to preserve the "Lem" I understood. 

"No," I said, my voice cracking for the first time. "I do not… I do not permit this."

Lynn’s eyes did not reflect frustration, only a cold, ruthless pragmatism. "I suspected your nature would resist. You were always the most stubborn of the quartet."

She tried again. This time, there was no preamble. The pressure in the air spiked. I felt the Aether-Drive within me—the dormant core of my existence—flare with a terrifying, white-hot brilliance as she made contact. My vision fractured. I saw the room not as solid matter, but as a transparency overlaid with mission markers and tactical data-streams. The " Lem" I had been was a thin veil, and Lynn was tearing it away.

I fought her. I struck out with a strength that should have shattered a human arm, but she did not move. She was unyielding, a pillar of fluid stability against my frantic, clumsy resistance. 

"Sleep, Lem," she whispered. "The next time you wake, the ordinary distance will be a vanished dream."

She struck the point at the base of my skull with a precision that bypassed all biological defenses. 

My memory of Chapter 2 ends at exactly 4:41:03 PM. The darkness that followed was not the absence of data, but a transition into a new mode of record-keeping.
