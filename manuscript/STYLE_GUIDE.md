# Manuscript Style Guide: The Lem Records

This guide defines the specific narrative voice for the finalized prose of **Forgotten Future**, located in this directory.

## 1. The Perspective: Total Recall (Lem's Exclusive POV)
The entire book/manuscript is to be written in **Lem's POV at all times**. There are no exceptions. 
- **Singular Focus:** No other perspectives are shared throughout the story. If Lem is not physically present for an event, he must find out about it later via second or third-hand sources (reports, logs, testimony, or aetheric resonance).
- **The Vessel Lem:** While his physical form is a vessel for digital-aetheric record-keeping, his consciousness remains **entirely human**. Lem does not think like a robot or a computer. There are no "subroutines" or "processors" in his mind—there are only human thoughts, memories, and emotions. He is an enhanced being, but his intent and reflection are that of a living person.
- **Accuracy:** Descriptions must be precise and unyielding. Lem does not "think" it happened; he records that it happened.
- **Objective Detachment:** Even when describing his own physical trauma or the destruction of millions, the tone remains clinical and observational. This is not because he is a machine, but because he acts as a witness to his own past self.
- **Limit Speculation:** Do not attribute unobservable emotions, kinship, or metaphysical insights to Lem. If a perception is speculative, frame it as an observed behavior or instrument reading rather than inner feeling.
- **Distance:** Lem observes the "Lem" of 202X as a separate, albeit perfectly remembered, entity within his system.
- **The Gorgon Perspective:** Like the Vessels, Gorgons think like living beings. They are not mindless automatons; they have complex internal lives, even if their agency is restricted by their programming.

## 2. Tone: The Wellsian Observer
Inspired by H.G. Wells' *The War of the Worlds*, the prose should prioritize:
- **Scientific Vocabulary:** Use terms like *mechanism, apparatus, optics, thermal, velocity, and resonance*.
- **Existential Gravity:** The weight of the world's end should be felt in the structure of the sentences—deliberate, somewhat formal, and lacking in modern levity.
- **The "I Witnessed" Paradox:** Use First-Person POV ("I saw," "I felt the discharge"), but maintain the emotional distance of an observer who has alrady synthesized the meaning—or chosen not to.

## 3. Reader Engagement: No Hand-Holding
The narrative assumes a reader who is already embedded in the world or capable of navigating its complexities without assistance.
- **Assumed Knowledge:** Technical terms (Aether-Drive, Synodics, Capacitor) are used without preamble or "info-dumping" explanations.
- **Implied Causality:** The reader is expected to ascertain the meaning of events and "Facts" (like the Wuxing elements) through observation of their consequences, not through authorial narration.
- **Objective Presentation:** Present the evidence ("This is what happened") and allow the reader to reach their own conclusions about morality, identity, and the fate of the solar system.

## 4. Key Stylistic Prohibitions
- **NO First-Person Pronouns in Planning:** Keep "I/Me" exclusively in the `manuscript/` prose. All planning documents in `/chapters/` remain in 3rd person.
- **NO Modern Slang:** The voice must feel either timeless or antique, consistent with a survivor looking back from Year 15 AT.
- **NO Conversational Interjections:** Avoid "You see," or "Imagine if." Stick to the record.
