# Chapter 7: Zenith

The ship reached its zenith—the point of maximum proximity before the controlled descent toward the Moon's far side—at precisely 04:00 ship-time. At this altitude, the lunar landscape was no longer a map; it was a physical weight. The shadows in the craters were deep, ink-black voids, and the crystalline structures of the Synodics caught the sun with a blinding, prismatic intensity. 

The psychological pressure of the sight finally breached the deck’s discipline. 

A soldier—Corporal Miller, according to my facial recognition logs—suddenly lurched away from his station. His breathing was a ragged, hyperventilating rasp that tripped the internal audio alarms. 

"It's fake!" he shouted, his voice cracking with a high-frequency vibration. "The whole sky is fake! Look at it! It’s right there! Why can I see the shadows moving? It’s not possible!"

The nearby soldiers moved to restrain him, their movements a clumsy mixture of duty and shared terror. They spoke in the low, urgent tones of men trying to convince themselves as much as him. "Calm down, Miller. It's the optics. Just the magnification."

"Don't lie to me!" Miller shrieked, his eyes wide and fixed on the looming plains of the Mare Moscoviense. "We're not in space! We're in a cage! The Moon is a cage!"

The disruption was total. The bridge crew hesitated, their hands hovering over controls as they watched the struggle. The abstract fear of the briefing had become the undeniable reality of the viewports, and Miller was merely the first to fracture.

Then, the heavy bulkhead door to the command annex cycled open. 

Linn entered the bridge. 

The atmosphere shifted instantly. Her presence acted as a thermal sink, drawing the chaotic energy of the room into a cold, focused point. She did not run; she moved with a rhythmic, mechanical grace that made the soldiers’ struggle look frantic and biological. Behind her, Commander Novak followed, a silent shadow of military efficiency, her eyes already scanning the room for data points.

Linn ignored Miller’s screaming at first. She walked directly to the central viewing platform, her gaze fixed on the lunar horizon. For a long moment, she simply watched the Moon, her profile a sharp, unyielding silhouette against the glare.

"Commander," Linn said, her voice a low-velocity resonance that cut through the noise. "Report."

Novak stepped forward. "Psychological breach, Ma'am. Corporal Miller. He passed all pre-mission evaluations. It appears the visual proximity has induced a state of acute existential shock."

Linn turned. Her eyes, though human in appearance, held the objective detachment of a high-resolution sensor. She looked at Miller, who was now pinned to the deck by three of his comrades. 

"The problem," Novak continued, her voice clinical, "is not a lack of information. It is the moment when the abstract becomes the sensorily undeniable. He cannot reconcile the reality of the Moon with the narrative of his training."

Linn walked toward the struggling corporal. The soldiers holding him instinctively pulled back as she approached, leaving Miller alone on the deck. He looked up at her, his face a mask of sweat and tears.

"Is it real?" he gasped. "Is it really that close?"

Linn did not offer comfort. She did not offer a lie. 

"It is precisely where it has always been," she said. "The error was yours for believing otherwise."

She looked at Novak. "He is a recursive variable. He will contaminate the others. We cannot afford the noise."

"There are no medical facilities for this type of trauma on board, Ma'am," Novak replied. "And we are past the point of safe return for the main vessel."

"Then remove him from the ship," Linn said.

A silence followed that was more profound than any vacuum. The soldiers froze. Miller’s sobbing stopped, replaced by a wide-eyed, silent horror. 

"Ma'am?" Novak asked, her voice the only thing that remained steady.

"Launch an emergency escape pod," Linn ordered, her tone as precise as a command line. "Set the trajectory for a ballistic return to Earth. If he survives the re-entry, it will be a testament to his luck. If not, it is a necessary reduction of system debt. Now."

The execution was swift. Novak did not hesitate; she signaled the guards. Miller was dragged from the bridge, his screams returning as he realized the finality of the decision. I recorded the resonance of his boots dragging against the metal, a fading percussion that ended with the hiss of the airlock.

Minutes later, from the observation port, we watched the small, metallic spark of the escape pod detach from the ship. It fired its thrusters, a brief flare of chemical light against the black, and began its long, lonely descent back toward the sapphire disc of Earth.

Linn did not watch it go. She returned to the command console, her hands moving over the interfaces with a velocity that suggested total integration. 

"Back to your stations," she said, without looking up. "The Moon is no longer a concept. It is our destination. Discipline will be maintained, or it will be discarded."

The crew returned to their posts. The panic was gone, replaced by a grim, mechanical focusedness. Linn had not restored their courage; she had simply replaced their existential fear with a more immediate, tangible terror.

I observed the reformation of the crew. They were no longer a group of men; they were components of a mechanism, functioning in the shadow of Linn’s absolute authority. 

As we began the final descent into the Moon’s far side, the intercom crackled. It was not a voice, but a low-frequency hum—a signal from the deeper levels of the ship. 

"The General is waiting," Novak whispered.

I recorded the shift in the ship's internal pressure. We had reached the zenith. The descent had begun.
