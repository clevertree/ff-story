# Chapter 14: The Shifting Moon

The dissolution of Lynn into the central column was not merely a physical transition; it was a rhythmic shift in the very laws of the pyramid. The obsidian hall, once silent and unyielding, began to resonate with a low-frequency thrum that threatened to vibrate my internal structure into dust. Above us, the vault opened into a funnel of absolute, blinding light—the Lunar Capacitor’s extraction point, now saturated with the fluid intelligence of the Water Vessel.

Panic, that jagged biological response I had cataloged so often in others, finally broke the discipline of the survivors. Two soldiers, their rifles clattering against the floor, scrambled toward the sealed bulkhead we had entered through. They hammered on the metal, their voices cracking as they screamed for the outer teams to open the doorway.

"Belay that!" Novak’s voice sliced through the din, amplified by the external speakers of her helm. "Seal yourselves! Do not move!"

"It’s coming down!" one of the men shrieked, pointing upward where a hairline fracture was racing across the ancient stone. "The whole Moon is unmaking itself!"

"This pyramid is the only stable coordinate in the solar system right now," Novak countered, her voice dropping to a terrifyingly calm register. "If you step outside that bulkhead, you are stepping into a vacuum and a debris field that will atomize you before you can take a breath. Return to your stations. Now."

The soldiers hesitated, then crawled back into their defensive arc, their movements jerky and small. They were right about the Moon. The vibrations through the floor were no longer echoes of distant impacts; they were the groans of the lunar crust itself, shifting and fracturing as the Capacitor reached its peak discharge.

Beside me, the air began to ripple. Rahu, previously locked in the stasis-field we had fought so hard to impose, was awakening. The energy surge Lynn had initiated was feeding the chamber, and the white-blue fire was leaking through the containment field like light through a cracked window.

Rahu’s eyes—if they could be called that—opened. He did not look at us. He looked at the central column where the Water Vessel had vanished.

"Lynn?" his voice was a hollow rasp, a sound of dry timber being crushed.

There was no reply. Only the accelerating thrum of the machine.

"Lynn!" he roared. The fire flared with a sudden, desperate intensity. The stasis field shattered, the blue-weighted energy dissipating into the amber light of the hall. He stood up, his form wavering and unstable, a man-shaped bonfire fueled by his own despair. 

He realized then what she had done. He saw the "Great Fry" she had orchestrated—the short-circuiting of the cosmic reset. He saw that she was gone, not as a casualty, but as a ghost in the wires.

"You won't have it," Rahu hissed, his fire turning a violent, incandescent white. "None of you will have it."

He did not attack us. He did not reach for the soldiers. In a final, suicidal act of non-compliance, he lunged toward the radiant center of the energy column. 

The collision was a catastrophic disruption of the elemental sequence. As Rahu’s fire-form entered the column, the coherent stream of energy—the Water-fed path—was contaminated by his volatility. I watched his physical cohesion fail. He did not melt; he disintegrated, his essence lighting up the column with a flare that exceeded my optical limits.

From the Earth, they would later report a "Second Sun" blooming in the lunar shadow—a flare so bright it cast shadows in the middle of a New York night. 

The disruption was the trigger. The "Great Fry" was no longer a theoretical cascade; it was a physical discharge. The electromagnetic world below us began to die in that heartbeat.

Then, the collapse.

The brilliance vanished. The thrumming in the floor stopped with a physical finality that made my ears ring. The light in the funnel overhead faded to a dull, dying orange. In the center of the chamber, the pillar of fire coalesced, shrinking until it took the form of a man again. Use of the term "man" was generous; the figure that fell to the tiles was physically diminished, his fire reduced to a faint, smoldering heat.

It was Rahu, but he was hollowed out. Lynn was nowhere to be seen.

"Container four! Now!" Novak’s voice was instantaneous. She was already moving toward the fallen Vessel, her tablet glowing with new commands.

The soldiers, their shock overridden by the sudden vacuum of authority, moved at her word. They deployed a heavy stasis unit, an industrial-grade version of the handheld devices we had used earlier. They didn't just target him; they boxed him, the blue-weighted energy sealing him inside a coffin of transparent force.

I watched them work, recording the efficiency of the containment. I felt a strange sense of mission-accomplishment—the Fire was out, the Water was spent, and I was still standing. I looked at Novak, expecting a word of acknowledgment, or perhaps the next set of waypoints.

She didn't look at me. She simply pointed.

"Unit W-01," she said to the team. "Recalibrate for Wood-frequency. Containment protocol Gamma-Six."

I did not have time to process the betrayal. I did not even have time to move. 

The soldiers turned their devices toward me. I felt the frequency shift—a sudden, heavy dampening of my internal Aether-Drive. My limbs, once fluid and responsive, became as rigid and unresponsive as a fallen log. The dream of my voluntary service, of the choice I had made on the lunar surface, dissolved into the cold reality of my designation.

I was not a soldier. I was not a hero. I was a "Lemon." And the Technocratic Core was merely securing its inventory.

As my consciousness began to flicker, the last thing I heard was the heavy, artificial silence of the pyramid. The Moon was still shattering outside, but in here, the quiet was absolute.
