I stood on my porch on that final Tuesday. The sky was an electric, pressurized blue. On the horizon, beyond the shimmering glass of the corporate towers, I saw them. They were not machines in the sense of human engineering; they were something grown of a different causality. Colossal silhouettes—**Monoliths** stadium-sized and terrifying—that the public mistook for tripods. From this distance, they were four-pointed shadows with two massive legs and two elongated arms reaching for the pavement, their metallic skins oscillating with a faint, thermal haze. They moved with a glacial, terrifying grace, ignoring the insects of human civilization beneath them.
