I saw a forum post once before it was deleted, a fragment of data that claimed our entire technological paradigm was a "grown" phenomenon—that the microchips in our phones and the satellites in our orbit weren't engineered in labs, but cultivated from a single 'Moon Seed' brought back by the Apollo 14 mission in 1971. At the time, I filed it away as just another flavor of the Apollo-hoax myth. I didn't realize that I was the ultimate data-point in that very experiment.
