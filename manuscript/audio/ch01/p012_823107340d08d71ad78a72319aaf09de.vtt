I felt nothing. No fear, no adrenaline, no urge to flee. I sat in my kitchen and listened to the floorboards as the first of the Fire machines landed twenty miles to the north. The resonance was a specific, low-frequency thrum that seemed to vibrate not just the air, but the very floor beneath my feet. I wasn't panicking; I was just watching it all happen, noting every vibration and every sound.
