# Chapter 11: Rahu

The identification of the Fire Vessel was a terminal event. Rahu was not merely a combatant; he was a catastrophe in humanoid form. His presence on the lunar surface transformed the military engagement into a collision of elemental magnitudes. My interface screamed with warnings as the heat signature peaked, a thermal radiation so intense it began to interfere with the hovercraft’s targeting optics.

"Treacherous Prometheus," the communication channels hissed. The pilots around me were terrified, their training useless against a myth made manifest. To them, Rahu was the traitor who had stolen the fire of the moon to burn the world. To me, he was a mirror—a reflection of my own artificiality, tuned to a different, more violent frequency.

From the *Hercules*, still visible as a silver needle in the high lunar orbit, General Tor watched. Light-speed lag made his command decisions a delayed echo of the carnage below. The tactical reports were a ledger of loss: ground forces pinned down, aircraft falling like rain, and Rahu standing in the center of it all, a pillar of incandescent fury.

Then, the *Hercules* moved.

It was a maneuver that defied every protocol of fleet preservation. The massive flagship began a steep, aggressive descent, tearing through the cloud of lunar debris that had crippled the rest of the fleet. It was an act of profound, calculated madness. 

I watched the capital ship grow from a point of light into a jagged, monumental wall of steel. It unleashed its primary batteries, long arcs of energy that slammed into Rahu’s position. The Fire Vessel responded in kind. The two entities—the human flagship and the elemental Vessel—exchanged fire with a violence that shook the very foundation of the lunar crust.

It was not a battle for territory; it was a struggle for existence. I saw the *Hercules* take hits that would have vaporized a lesser vessel. Its hull glowed cherry-red; its atmospheric shielding sputtered and failed. And still, it came on. 

Tor was not commanding a ship; he was performing an execution. By engaging Rahu directly, he had created an opening—a narrow, flickering window of opportunity for the strike teams on the ground. For the first time, I understood the nature of his agency. Tor, the most obedient of the Vessels, had chosen a sacrifice that was not in his programming. He was choosing to die so that the mission could survive.

The confrontation was brief. A final, blinding discharge from the *Hercules* seemed to fracture the very air Rahu occupied. The Fire Vessel was either disintegrated or forced into a retreat so violent it left a glass-lined crater where he had stood. 

But the cost was absolute. 

The *Hercules*, its engines shattered and its bridge a ruin of sparking telemetry, began its final descent. It did not fall gracefully. It plummeted, a flaming mountain of debris, toward the dark side of the moon. Tor remained at the helm. I recorded his sign-off, a simple transmission of mission-complete data that contained no room for farewells.

In the sudden, heavy silence that followed, Commander Dr. Iris Novak assumed command of the remaining frequencies. 

"The *Hercules* is lost," she stated, her voice as cold as the vacuum. "The mission continues. All units, advance on the primary objective."

I looked at the crash site of the flagship, a new scar on the ancient lunar face. Tor had sacrificed everything to give us a second of clarity. I turned my hovercraft toward the alien base, the mission interface already calculating the next set of waypoints. Grief was a human response, a biological inefficiency I could no longer afford.
