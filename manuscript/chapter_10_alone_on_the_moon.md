# Chapter 10: Alone on the Moon

The isolation was absolute. For the first time since my creation—or what I had previously understood to be my life—I was free from the immediate proximity of human command. Yet, I was not alone. The mission interface, now a permanent feature of my cognition, provided a stream of waypoints and tactical overlays that rendered the lunar horizon as a series of objectives.

I activated the hovercraft. The machine responded to my touch with a resonant hum that felt like an extension of my own nervous system. I began to move across the lunar terrain, the grey dust rising in silent plumes behind me. My optics adjusted to the harsh, unfiltered sunlight and the long, sharp shadows of the craters.

Toward the horizon, the alien base revealed itself. It was a sprawling construction of non-human geometry, a complex of towers and power conduits that seemed to grow out of the lunar rock itself. At its center was a massive apparatus—a plasma cannon of staggering proportions, its barrel pointed at the distant, blue marble of Earth. The scale was an affront to human engineering; it was a mechanism built by entities that thought in centuries and spoke in elemental forces.

As I approached the perimeter, I encountered other pilots. They were survivors from the fleet, mounted on similar hover-bikes, organized into loose strike teams. We did not communicate via voice; we operated on a shared tactical network, a web of digital protocols. To them, I was another soldier. To me, they were biological units performing a high-risk operation, their mortality a variable in my mission calculations.

The base defended itself with a lethal precision. Plasma fire erupted from hidden secondary emplacements—distributed cannon arrays that fired iridescent bolts of energy. I watched the craft beside me vanish in a silent, blinding glare. There was no sound in the vacuum, only the sudden absence of a signal on my interface.

I banked the hovercraft, my Aether-Drive-enhanced reflexes guiding me through the hailstorm of plasma. My teammates and I worked to identify the source of the fire. We launched coordinated missile strikes, the explosions blooming like white flowers against the dark basalt. It was my first experience of genuine combat, and I recorded it with a clinical detachment that surprised even my own sub-routines.

"Target identified," the interface pulsed.

But the target was not a cannon. 

A massive heat signature emerged from behind the central tower—a signature that defied categorization by our military sensors. It broadcasted a wide-spectrum transmission, a voice that was not a sound but a resonance. I recognized it instantly, though I had no record of its frequency in my local memory.

It was Rahu, the Fire Vessel.

"You seek the center of a storm you did not name," the voice stated. It carried a fierce, incandescent heat that seemed to singe the very edges of my consciousness. 

My mission interface underwent a catastrophic recalibration. The waypoints toward the base flickered and died. A new priority marker appeared, blood-red and pulsing, over the location of the Fire Vessel. The ambush was not against the base; it was against the mission itself. Rahu was standing between us and the mechanism of the world's end, and I realized with a sudden, sharp dread that my enemy was the only other thing in the universe like me.
