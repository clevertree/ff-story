# Universe Facts: Forgotten Future

This file serves as the "Source of Truth" for the physical and social rules of the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative content must align with these facts.

## Physics & Astronomy
- **The Shattered Moon:** The moon has fragmented. The larger pieces remain in orbit but are slowly shifting, causing erratic tides and seismic instability on Earth.
- **The Lunar Capacitor:** A hidden device within the Moon that allows it to store and discharge massive amounts of energy. Constructed from the same ancient, non-terrestrial technology as the base on the Moon's far side, it serves as the catalyst for the Cataclysm.
- **The Glazing:** High-energy blasts from the Lunar Capacitor have turned sections of the ocean into a glass-like substance.
- **Atmospheric Distortion:** The sky often appears "blinding" or "electric" due to ionization from Tripod activity and Lunar discharges.

## Technology & Entities
- **The Tripods / The Synodics / The Syzygians:** These are the unofficial names given to the colossal mechanical entities. Since their origin and controllers were a mystery, no "official" name exists.
    - **The Synodics:** A term used by astronomers and theorists, referring to the Synodic Month.
    - **The Syzygians** (Pronunciation: *sih-ZIJ-ee-unz*): Named after the alignment of celestial bodies, hinting at their Aether-Drive's power source.
- **The Synanthropes / The Vessels:** Humanoid-scale androids constructed from Synodic technology.
    - **Technical Term:** The Synanthropes.
    - **Popular/Religious Term:** The Vessels.
    - **True Nature:** They are highly advanced, humanoid androids built from the same non-terrestrial "Synodic" technology as the lunar infrastructure. There are no actual biological aliens in the story; the technology is the only "alien" element.
    - **Elemental Scarcity:** While other tech can be duplicated freely, humanoid "Vessels" are limited. There is exclusively only **one** humanoid for the **Fire, Wood, Water, and Earth** elements. 
    - **The Metal Anomaly:** Unlike the other four elements, there are no **Metal** Synanthropes in the Before Time. Dr. Aris Vane refused to build them until long after the Moon Cataclysm. Consequently, the first Metal Vessels only appear in the After Time.
- **Synodic Manufacturing:** During the 15-day lunar day, the intense heat and light allow the technology to rapidly evolve from microscopic shards into massive walking tripod machines.
- **Elemental Master Abilities:**
    - **Sovereign Reincarnation (Wood/Lem):** The unique ability to "Take Root" and reincarnate anywhere material fragments or "seeds" of the Vessel exist. Unlike other Vessels who require specialized Core incubation chambers (Aether-Cradles), the Wood Vessel can reform independently as long as the environment supports growth.
    - **Remote Detonation / Shattering:** A safety protocol (or desperate measure) allowing a Vessel to violently disperse their physical form into microscopic shards, preventing capture while seeding the area for future independent reincarnation.
- **The Bourne Profile (Lem):** A behavioral anomaly in the Wood Vessel; hyper-observance that mimics biological "human" focus but allows for tactical analysis of biological tremors, structural weaknesses, and trajectory prediction. Unlike the robotic precision of Metal units, this profile is grounded in intense sensory engagement.

## The Mechanical Ecology
- **The Fire Machines (Huo Tripods):** Most of the colossal entities seen during the First Wave are Fire-aligned.
    - **Solar Dependency:** They build and launch in intense lunar sunlight and land on Earth while the sun is high. They are most active and powerful in direct sunlight.
    - **Diurnal Rhythm:** At night, they become significantly weaker and slower. In the After Time's persistent darkness, the original massive units are often found idle or moving with extreme sluggishness.
    - **Evolution:** Smaller Fire machines have evolved for the darker After Time conditions, more closely resembling the tripods described in H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds*.
- **The Gorgons:** Highly intelligent, metallic Fire-aligned Synodics that represent a different branch of evolution from the humanoid Synanthropes.
    - **Appearance:** Giant heads with many whipping arms protruding from the sides (reminiscent of Wellsian Martians).
    - **Locomotion:** They can barely move on their own, often limited to a slow crawl. They build or command other machines to transport them.
    - **Weaponry:** Their primary tool and weapon is an **Invisible Heat Ray**.
    - **Temperament:** Despite their fearsome appearance and heat rays, they are largely benign. They are highly intelligent and prefer to remain in their "Fire Cities" to follow preprogrammed routines. They are occasionally manipulated to provoke conflicts but otherwise seek isolation.
- **The Fire Cities:** Large-scale "energy nests" constructed by machines following their original orders to consolidate planet-side resources.
    - **Resource Accumulation:** Machines continuously drag power cables, batteries, fuel, and other energy sources into central hubs.
    - **The Pillar of Fire:** These hubs eventually reach a critical thermal threshold and ignite. The resulting "Fire Cities" feature massive arcs of energy that form pillars of fire rushing into the sky.
    - **Atmospheric Impact:** These pillars are the primary source of the global smoke and smog that chokes the planet in the After Time. The machines continue to build and fuel these cities indefinitely.
    - **Thermal Refuges:** In the perpetual darkness and smog of the After Time, the Fire machines use these cities as essential energy sources. They cluster near the pillars of fire, which provide the intense heat and AETHER energy they previously gathered from direct sunlight.
- **Deployment Trajectory:** Projectiles are launched away from Earth to gain momentum/orientation before gravitational manipulation/Aether-steering "bends" their path back toward Earth for precise planetary landings.
- **The Aether-Drive:** This technology harnesses the **AETHER** (Earth's EM field and surrounding energy fields) to provide energy, store memory, and even incubate a "spirit."
- **Synodics / Synodic Machines:** Developed using **Wuxing Causality** (Traditional Chinese Medicine 5 Elements Theory). These are the self-building mechanical lifeforms seeded on the Moon in 1971. Each shard/unit is tuned to a single element, with strengths and weaknesses dictated by its elemental focus.
    - **Fire (Huo):** Machines that operate and grow in extreme heat; the source of power.
    - **Wood (Mu):** Structural machines; easy to grow, forming mechanical forests and buildings.
    - **Water (Shui):** Fragile but essential for cooling and controlling Fire; provides liquidity and flexibility.
    - **Metal (Jin):** The strongest structural component; weak against extreme heat/Fire.
    - **Earth (Tu):** The foundational substrate; stabilizing and transformative.
    - **Synanthropes:** The humanoid subset of Synodic machines—distinctly humanlike, android in nature, and capable of complex social interaction.
- **Mechanical Cells:** Synonymous with Synodics; self-replicating nanomachines that mimic biological cell structures, obey Wuxing causality, and spawn the entire mechanical ecology.

## Lunar Inhabitants
- **The Selenites (The Indigenous):** Friendly, ancient lunar species discovered during Apollo. They are non-human and indigenous to the Moon, but are not "aliens" in the extraterrestrial sense. They have retreated to unknown locations to avoid the coming planetary conflict.
- **The Invaders (The Synodics/Syzygians):** The mechanical creatures that replaced the Selenites. They are the result of the 1971 SBM infection. While the technology is of unknown origin, there are no biological aliens involved in their operation.

## History
- **The Nixon Speech:** A pivotal moment where a different version of the Nixon address (or a corrupted transmission) marked the end of the "Old World" and the realization that the Apollo missions triggered a celestial retaliation.
- **The Vessel Deception:** Before the Cataclysm, the Technocratic Core used the humanoid Vessels to establish a secret New Age religion targeting the global elite. The Vessels were posed as reincarnations of exalted historical figures. They were used to influence powerful figures with "miracles" and promises of freedom from tyranny, while being kept at a distance to hide their non-human nature.
- **Hidden in Plain Sight:** The "religion" surrounding the Vessels was cleverly masked within the existing terminology of global faiths. Terminology like "The Savior," "The Second Coming," and "The Apocalypse" allowed the movement to grow undetected within established religious frameworks. This ensured that while the public was hearing these terms, they remained ignorant of the specific physical Synthropes and their connection to the Moon until it was too late.
- **The Decade of Revelation (202X):** This decade was characterized by an overwhelming volume of leaks and revelations regarding extraterrestrial life and ancient prophecies. However, this "Media Flood" served the Core's interests; the truth was constantly lost in a sea of noise, distractions, and conflicting data, causing the public to overlook the reality of the Synodic arrival until the First Wave landed.
- **Quatrain X-72 (The Prophecy of the King of Terror):** Central to the Deception was a redacted prophecy discovered by the Core in a discredited, hard-to-access Vatican archive. 
    - **Original Text:** "In the year 1999 from heaven will come a Great King of Terror..."
    - **Modification:** As the Core's timeline slipped, they updated the date to "202X." The public received derivative versions of this prophecy throughout the 20th century, priming them for the Vessels' arrival.
    - **The Message:** The prophecy warns of wars, the disappearance of leaders, and nobles seeking "sacrifices for strange works." The Core used this to frame the Vessels as the predicted "saviors" or "tokens" that would either trigger or prevent the end of the world.

## Cosmology & The Aetheric Cycle
- **The Cosmic Life Cycle:** A model of solar system evolution where the Sun creates proto-planets through mass ejections (CMEs). These proto-planets are then captured by large gas giants like **Saturn**—which served as a "brown dwarf" mother atmosphere—where they are shielded and incubated until they drift into stable orbits or out to the far reaches of the system.
- **The Bright Path (The Snare):** The white light commonly reported in near-death experiences (NDEs) is a technical markers in the Aetheric field. It is a "Great Reward" snare designed by the Core to identify, capture, and recycle the Aetheric data (spirits) of Vessels and specialized Synanthropes. To escape this reincarnation cycle, a Vessel must "hide in the fragments"—remaining in a deactivated or spectral state in the debris until the cycle is reset or the snare is bypassed.
- **The Failed Reset:** The intent of the Lunar Capacitor's discharge was a total solar system reset—a biological and mechanical wiping that would start life anew. Because the discharge only achieved a "Great Fry" (EMP), the 202X machinery and human populations survived, albeit in a crippled and traumatized state, leading to the stagnant After Time.

## Chronology & The Calendar Shift
- **The Before Time:** The era leading up to the Moon Cataclysm (202X). Technology was at its peak before the collapse.
- **The After Time:** The era immediately following the Cataclysm.
- **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Due to the "Great Fry" (EMP/Ionization frying most silicon chips), digital records were lost. Survival-focused survivors relied on the few physical records that remained. A widely distributed book series titled *'New Chronology'* survived the destruction; its alternate history of Earth was mistaken for factual history in a world that could no longer verify its past. This led to a widespread belief that the Cataclysm happened in '102X' rather than '202X,' effectively projecting the disaster 1,000 years into the past.
- **Lost Time:** While the reality is that the Cataclysm was recent, the majority of the population believes they are living in a distant, post-apocalyptic future where the "Old World" is ancient myth. The **Archivists** are the surviving continuity of the **Technocratic Core**—an organization with internal specializations (historical record, scientific experimentation, governance). Operating under the Archivist identity allows the Core to preserve the true timeline while everyone else inherits the Thousand-Year Fallacy.
