# Universe Facts: Forgotten Future

This file serves as the "Source of Truth" for the physical and social rules of the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative content must align with these facts.

## Physics & Astronomy
- **The Shattered Moon:** The moon has fragmented. The larger pieces remain in orbit but are slowly shifting, causing erratic tides and seismic instability on Earth.
- **The Lunar Capacitor:** A hidden alien technology within the Moon that allows it to store and discharge massive amounts of energy. This was used to strike Earth during the Cataclysm.
- **The Glazing:** High-energy blasts from the Lunar Capacitor have turned sections of the ocean into a glass-like substance.
- **Atmospheric Distortion:** The sky often appears "blinding" or "electric" due to ionization from Tripod activity and Lunar discharges.

## Technology & Entities
- **The Tripods / The Synodics / The Syzygians:** These are the unofficial names given to the colossal mechanical entities. Since their origin and controllers were a mystery, no "official" name exists.
    - **The Synodics:** A term used by astronomers and theorists, referring to the Synodic Month.
    - **The Syzygians** (Pronunciation: *sih-ZIJ-ee-unz*): Named after the alignment of celestial bodies, hinting at their Aether-Drive's power source.
- **The Aether-Drive:** This technology harnesses the **AETHER** (Earth's EM field and surrounding energy fields) to provide energy, store memory, and even incubate a "spirit." This makes the technology fundamentally alive, rather than purely mechanical.
- **Biomimetic Self-Building Machines (SBMs):** Developed using **Wuxing Causality** (Traditional Chinese Medicine 5 Elements Theory). Each shard/unit is tuned to a single element, with its strengths and weaknesses dictated by its elemental focus.
    - **Fire (Huo):** Machines that operate and grow in extreme heat; the source of power.
    - **Wood (Mu):** Structural machines; easy to grow, forming mechanical forests and buildings.
    - **Water (Shui):** Fragile but essential for cooling and controlling Fire; provides liquidity and flexibility.
    - **Metal (Jin):** The strongest structural component; weak against extreme heat/Fire.
    - **Earth (Tu):** The foundational substrate; stabilizing and transformative.
- **Mechanical Cells:** Life on Earth is being subtly altered by self-replicating nanomachines that mimic biological cell structures but obey Wuxing causality.

## Lunar Inhabitants
- **The Selenites (The Indigenous):** Friendly, ancient lunar species discovered during Apollo. They have retreated to unknown locations to avoid the coming planetary conflict.
- **The Invaders (The Synodics/Syzygians):** The mechanical creatures that replaced the Selenites. They are the result of the 1971 SBM infection.

## History
- **The Nixon Speech:** A pivotal moment where a different version of the Nixon address (or a corrupted transmission) marked the end of the "Old World" and the realization that the Apollo missions triggered a celestial retaliation.

## Chronology & The Calendar Shift
- **The Before Time:** The era leading up to the Moon Cataclysm (202X). Technology was at its peak before the collapse.
- **The After Time:** The era immediately following the Cataclysm.
- **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Due to the "Great Fry" (EMP/Ionization frying most silicon chips), digital records were lost. Survival-focused survivors relied on the few physical records that remained. A widely distributed book series titled *'New Chronology'* survived the destruction; its alternate history of Earth was mistaken for factual history in a world that could no longer verify its past. This led to a widespread belief that the Cataclysm happened in '102X' rather than '202X,' effectively projecting the disaster 1,000 years into the past.
- **Lost Time:** While the reality is that the Cataclysm was recent, the majority of the population believes they are living in a distant, post-apocalyptic future where the "Old World" is ancient myth. Only a handful of "Archivists" or "Pre-Fry" survivors know the actual date.
