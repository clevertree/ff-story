# Universe Facts: Forgotten Future

This file serves as the "Source of Truth" for the physical and social rules of the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative content must align with these facts.

## Physics & Astronomy
- **The Shattered Moon:** The moon has fragmented. The larger pieces remain in orbit but are slowly shifting, causing erratic tides and seismic instability on Earth.
- **The Glazing:** High-energy blasts (likely from the Shattered Moon or the Tripods) have turned sections of the ocean into a glass-like substance.
- **Atmospheric Distortion:** The sky often appears "blinding" or "electric" due to ionization from Tripod activity.

## Technology & Entities
- **The Tripods:** Colossal mechanical entities of unknown origin. They arrived during "The Shaking," a global seismic event coinciding with the Moon's destruction.
- **Mechanical Cells:** Life on Earth is being subtly altered by self-replicating nanomachines that mimic biological cell structures but obey different physical laws.
- **Hyper Sleep:** A technology used by remnants of humanity to survive the long, toxic "nuclear-winter" style environmental collapse.

## History
- **The Nixon Speech:** A pivotal moment where a different version of the Nixon address (or a corrupted transmission) marked the end of the "Old World" and the realization that the Apollo missions triggered a celestial retaliation.

## Chronology & The Calendar Shift
- **The Before Time:** The era leading up to the Moon Cataclysm (202X). Technology was at its peak before the collapse.
- **The After Time:** The era immediately following the Cataclysm.
- **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Due to the "Great Fry" (EMP/Ionization frying most silicon chips), digital records were lost. Survival-focused survivors relied on the few physical records that remained. A widely distributed book series titled *'New Chronology'* survived the destruction; its alternate history of Earth was mistaken for factual history in a world that could no longer verify its past. This led to a widespread belief that the Cataclysm happened in '102X' rather than '202X,' effectively projecting the disaster 1,000 years into the past.
- **Lost Time:** While the reality is that the Cataclysm was recent, the majority of the population believes they are living in a distant, post-apocalyptic future where the "Old World" is ancient myth. Only a handful of "Archivists" or "Pre-Fry" survivors know the actual date.
