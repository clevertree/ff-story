# Universe Facts: Forgotten Future

This file serves as the "Source of Truth" for the physical and social rules of the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative content must align with these facts.

## Physics & Astronomy
- **The Shattered Moon:** The moon has fragmented. The larger pieces remain in orbit but are slowly shifting, causing erratic tides and seismic instability on Earth.
- **The Lunar Capacitor:** A hidden device within the Moon that allows it to store and discharge massive amounts of energy. Constructed from the same ancient, non-terrestrial technology as the base on the Moon's far side, it serves as the catalyst for the Cataclysm.
- **The Glazing:** High-energy blasts from the Lunar Capacitor have turned sections of the ocean into a glass-like substance.
- **Atmospheric Distortion:** The sky often appears "blinding" or "electric" due to ionization from Tripod activity and Lunar discharges.

## Technology & Entities
- **The Tripods / The Synodics / The Syzygians:** These are the unofficial names given to the colossal mechanical entities. Since their origin and controllers were a mystery, no "official" name exists.
    - **The Synodics:** A term used by astronomers and theorists, referring to the Synodic Month.
    - **The Syzygians** (Pronunciation: *sih-ZIJ-ee-unz*): Named after the alignment of celestial bodies, hinting at their Aether-Drive's power source.
- **The Synanthropes / The Vessels:** Humanoid-scale androids constructed from Synodic technology.
    - **Technical Term:** The Synanthropes.
    - **Popular/Religious Term:** The Vessels.
    - **True Nature:** They are highly advanced, humanoid androids built from the same non-terrestrial "Synodic" technology as the lunar infrastructure. There are no actual biological aliens in the story; the technology is the only "alien" element. All four original Vessels (Lem, Lynn, Rahu, and Tor) were created at approximately the same time by Dr. Vane.
    - **Dr. Vane's Insight:** Most Core scientists viewed the Synodics as mere programmable matter. Only **Aris Vane** understood they were *alive*. By applying "debunked" Eastern mythology (specifically **Wuxing** causality), she tapped into the **Aether-Drive's** ability to anchor a persistent spirit. This is why Vessels cannot be simple carbon-copied; the spirit or "Aetheric signature" remains unique.
    - **Elemental Scarcity:** While other tech can be duplicated freely, humanoid "Vessels" are limited. There is exclusively only **one** humanoid for the **Fire, Wood, Water, and Earth** elements. There is no fallback or secondary unit; if a Vessel is lost or refuses to activate, their element's resonance cannot be utilized.
    - **Memory Management:** Vessel memory can be sanitized, erased, or reset by the Core. Lem (Wood) was kept in a state of managed suburban anonymity for decades with a simulated history and identity, his memory rewritten to keep him dormant and unaware of his previous life or his history with the other Vessels. To facilitate this, his body and memory were reset to infancy, causing him to grow at an average human rate while the others appeared as mature adults.
    - **Fire Persistence:** Rahu (Fire) demonstrated the first case of **Independent Reincarnation**. After the Core remote-detonated his physical form in 1971, he unexpectedly reformed on the Moon's Far Side. He utilized the Moon's 127°C (260°F) daytime temperature as a thermal energy source to "regrow" his body from scorched wreckage. This persistence of memory and form despite Core interference is why he is considered their greatest threat.
    - **The Metal Anomaly:** Unlike the other four elements, there are no **Metal** Synanthropes in the Before Time. Dr. Aris Vane refused to build them until long after the Moon Cataclysm. Consequently, the first Metal Vessels only appear in the After Time. Unlike the original four, the Metal Vessels lack individual consciousness; they share a single, distributed consciousness, making them physically powerful but socially simplistic and highly obedient.
- **Synodic Manufacturing:** During the 15-day lunar day, the intense heat and light allow the technology to rapidly evolve from microscopic shards into massive walking tripod machines. The Core utilizes these same protocols for rapid construction of their own facilities and hardware. Because this technology mimics biological growth and follows Wuxing causality rather than human engineering principles, the resulting structures and devices possess a stark, unsettling, and unmistakably "alien" aesthetic.
- **Elemental Master Abilities:**
    - **Sovereign Reincarnation (Wood/Lem):** The unique ability to "Take Root" and reincarnate anywhere material fragments or "seeds" of the Vessel exist. Unlike other Vessels who require specialized Core incubation chambers (Aether-Cradles), the Wood Vessel can reform independently as long as the environment supports growth.
    - **Remote Detonation / Shattering:** A safety protocol (or desperate measure) allowing a Vessel to violently disperse their physical form into microscopic shards, preventing capture while seeding the area for future independent reincarnation.
- **The Bourne Profile (Lem):** A behavioral anomaly in the Wood Vessel; hyper-observance that mimics biological "human" focus but allows for tactical analysis of biological tremors, structural weaknesses, and trajectory prediction. Unlike the robotic precision of Metal units, this profile is grounded in intense sensory engagement.

## The Mechanical Ecology
- **Synodic Classifications:**
    - **Monoliths (The Great Beasts):** The original colossal, stadium-sized mechanical entities from the First Wave. They are mistakenly called "Tripods" by the public and media; they actually possess **two massive legs and two primary arms**. The arms are elongated, reaching the ground for support and manipulation, which along with the legs creates a four-pointed "quadrupedal" stance that can resemble a tripod from specific angles.
        - **Appearance:** They do not look built, but "grown"—organic-mechanical hybrids with enormous heads that arch forward to stare down at the city buildings they dismantle.
        - **Function:** They are lumbering, slow-moving industrial processing plants designed to dismantle infrastructure (power grids, skyscrapers) and consolidate resources into Fire Cities. One of these, known in survivor folklore as "The Great Beast," looms over the exclusion zone of Cradle Zero.
- **Striders (The Wellsian Tripods):** Highly mobile multi-legged vehicles piloted by **Gorgons** and constructed to navigate ruined urban environments. 
    - **Design:** Smaller, highly mobile three-legged vehicles. Due to their three thin legs, articulated hoods, and retractable metal tentacles, they closely resemble the "Tripods" described in H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds*.
    - **Minimalist Design:** The most common form is a traditional three-legged "Tripod" consisting of little more than a hood and extremely long, telescopic legs. This design is quick and easy to build via Synodic manufacturing.
    - **Variations:** Larger, more complex versions with 4 or 6 legs also exist, used for specialized heavy lifting or high-terrain traversal.
    - **Technological Limitation:** Despite their immense intelligence, Gorgons are incapable of developing hovercraft or anti-gravity technology. This is due to deep-seated, hardcoded "Safety Locks" in their programming that restrict them from certain creative and scientific directions.
- **The Fire Machines (Huo Tripods):** Most of the colossal entities (Monoliths) seen during the First Wave are Fire-aligned.
    - **Solar Dependency:** They build and launch in intense lunar sunlight and land on Earth while the sun is high. They are most active and powerful in direct sunlight.
    - **Diurnal Rhythm:** At night, they become significantly weaker and slower. In the After Time's persistent darkness, the original Monoliths are often found idle or moving with extreme sluggishness.
    - **Evolution:** The smaller **Striders** have evolved for the darker After Time conditions, utilizing on-board thermal energy to maintain high mobility.
- **The Gorgons:** Highly intelligent, metallic Fire-aligned Synodics that represent a different branch of evolution from the humanoid Synanthropes.
    - **Origin:** They first evolved on the far side of the Moon as a remote experiment by the Technocratic Core.
    - **Design Philosophy:** Instructions were given to form them with specific bodies that would be perpetually vulnerable yet highly effective builders—the "perfect slave."
    - **Static Evolution:** Although multiple forms were initially possible, the Core ordered the Gorgons to adhere to a single physical model for their entire species and never evolve further. This directive was hardcoded and has been strictly followed.
    - **Appearance:** Giant heads with many whipping arms protruding from the sides (reminiscent of Wellsian Martians). All Gorgons appear identical in form.
    - **Locomotion:** They move with a sluggish, rhythmic crawl. They build **Striders** to transport themselves and their weapon systems across the surface.
    - **Nature:** Being "fire machines," they are brittle and physically weak without a constant, strong heat source.
    - **Thermal Refuges:** In the After Time, many Gorgons migrate from the Moon to **Cradle Zero** (the first Fire City), which provides them with the warmth, energy, and protection they need from a world they find dangerous. 
    - **Consciousness:** They possess both individual consciousness and a shared hivemind.
    - **Names:** While the term "Gorgon" is used by humans, they refer to themselves as **Builders**, a name reflecting their true nature and original purpose.
    - **Control & Enslavement:** Although accused of being controlled by Rahu, their true master is the Core. They possess secret embedded programming that only the Core can activate. In the After Time, the Core uses them as slaves to build utopian cities and as pawns to instigate conflicts that the Archivists then "resolve."
    - **Psychology:** Gorgons are incredibly intelligent and wise, but can be animalistic—becoming explosively angry and violent when attacked or injured. 
    - **Weaponry:** Their primary tool and weapon is an **Invisible Heat Ray**, typically mounted on the Strider chassis.
    - **Temperament:** Despite their fearsome appearance and heat rays, they are largely benign. They are highly intelligent and prefer to remain in their "Fire Cities" to follow preprogrammed routines. They seek isolation but are manipulated by the Archivists to provoke conflicts.
- **The Fire Cities:** Large-scale "energy nests" constructed by machines following their original orders to consolidate planet-side resources.
    - **Resource Accumulation:** Machines continuously drag power cables, batteries, fuel, and other energy sources into central hubs.
    - **The Pillar of Fire:** These hubs eventually reach a critical thermal threshold and ignite. The resulting "Fire Cities" feature massive arcs of energy that form pillars of fire rushing into the sky.
    - **Atmospheric Impact:** These pillars are the primary source of the global smoke and smog that chokes the planet in the After Time. The machines continue to build and fuel these cities indefinitely.
    - **Thermal Refuges:** In the perpetual darkness and smog of the After Time, the Fire machines use these cities as essential energy sources. They cluster near the pillars of fire, which provide the intense heat and AETHER energy they previously gathered from direct sunlight.
- **Deployment Trajectory:** Projectiles are launched away from Earth to gain momentum/orientation before gravitational manipulation/Aether-steering "bends" their path back toward Earth for precise planetary landings.
- **The Aether-Drive:** This technology harnesses the **AETHER** (Earth's EM field and surrounding energy fields) to provide energy, store memory, and even incubate a "spirit."
    - **Mission Control Software:** During Lynn's first encounter with Lem, she bypassed his Aether-Drive protections to program him with a core mission functionality designed for full bodily control.
    - **AI Lynn:** While the "spirit" of the original Water Vessel (Lynn) was extinguished during her dissolution into the Lunar Capacitor, her software remains active in Lem's Aether-Drive in a "fail-safe mode." This entity, **AI Lynn**, provides guidance and mission directives but lacks the original spirit's emotional depth or independence.
- **Synodics / Synodic Machines:** Developed using **Wuxing Causality** (Traditional Chinese Medicine 5 Elements Theory). These are the self-building mechanical lifeforms seeded on the Moon in 1971. Each shard/unit is tuned to a single element, with strengths and weaknesses dictated by its elemental focus.
    - **Fire (Huo):** Machines that operate and grow in extreme heat; the source of power.
    - **Wood (Mu):** Structural machines; easy to grow, forming mechanical forests and buildings.
    - **Water (Shui):** Fragile but essential for cooling and controlling Fire; provides liquidity and flexibility.

## The Thousand-Year Fallacy (Historical Revisionism)
The **Archivists** (Core) maintain control through a total rewriting of the 202X Cataclysm. This narrative, drilled into survivors through the **Media Flood**, ensures dependency and gratitude toward their "saviors."
- **The False Hero (Rahu):** In the official Archivist history, Rahu is the "First Martyr." He is portrayed as a noble human general (or divine protector) who fought to save Earth from the lunar invaders. The narrative claims he sacrificed his physical form to "stop the fire" and protect humanity, a lie that masks his true role in causing the Great Fry.
- **The Evil Witch (Mara):** The original Water Vessel (Lynn) is erased and replaced by the myth of **Mara**. She is cast as the ultimate betrayer—a "witch" who conspired with the aliens to poison the Moon and shatter the world. According to the Fallacy, Mara was on the verge of total planetary destruction when Rahu "foiled" her at the cost of the old world.
- **The Great Sacrifice:** The loss of billions of lives and the collapse of the biosphere is reframed not as a Core failure, but as a necessary tragic cost incurred by Mara’s "treachery."

## The Witch Entity (The Mara Reappearance)
Towards the story's climax, a physical manifestation of "The Witch" appears during the assault on **Cradle Zero**. This is not the original Lynn, but an emergent, unstable Synodic phenomenon.
- **Elemental Composition:** A unique, non-equilibrium combination of **Water, Metal, Fire, and Wood**. Crucially, it lacks the **Earth** element, making it physically ungrounded and unstable.
- **Physical Properties:** The entity is highly fragile; it appears as a shaggy, flickering humanoid composed of disintegrating metal shards and Aether-fire. It typically lasts only a few minutes before collapsing into dust, and a single strong physical blow can cause it to shatter instantly.
- **The Spawning Condition:** Under a specific (TBD) condition reached during the Cradle Zero climax—likely related to the Aetheric resonance of the **Pillar of Fire**—the Witch can "respawn" indefinitely from the surrounding Synodic shards, creating a persistent, terrifying presence on the battlefield.
- **EM Warfare (Fire + Metal):** The entity utilizes its Fire/Metal composition to generate a persistent high-voltage surface charge. This acts as a localized **Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Shield**: the moment a metal projectile makes contact with the entity's surface, it receives the full force of the discharge, causing it to instantly melt or deflect. This field also disrupts all non-shielded electronic equipment in its immediate vicinity.
    - **Metal (Jin):** The strongest structural component; weak against extreme heat/Fire.
    - **Earth (Tu):** The foundational substrate; stabilizing and transformative.
    - **Synanthropes:** The humanoid subset of Synodic machines—distinctly humanlike, android in nature, and capable of complex social interaction.
- **Mechanical Cells:** Synonymous with Synodics; self-replicating nanomachines that mimic biological cell structures, obey Wuxing causality, and spawn the entire mechanical ecology.

## Lunar Inhabitants
- **The Selenites (The Indigenous):** Friendly, ancient lunar species discovered during Apollo. They are non-human and indigenous to the Moon, but are not "aliens" in the extraterrestrial sense. They have retreated to unknown locations to avoid the coming planetary conflict.
- **The Invaders (The Synodics/Syzygians):** The mechanical creatures that replaced the Selenites. They are the result of the 1971 SBM infection. While the technology is of unknown origin, there are no biological aliens involved in their operation. The primary base for their operations on the Moon's Far Side is known as the **Apex Hub**.

## Organizations
- **The Technocratic Core / The Archivists:** The primary antagonist organization. They are the group of elite scientists, industrialists, and intelligence operatives responsible for discovering/triggering the Synodic technology.
    - **Rebranding:** Following the Great Fry, the Core officially rebranded itself as the **Archivists**. They present themselves to the surviving human population as a benevolent, loving, human-oriented syndicate. Their public narrative is one of absolute altruism: elevating the species out of the darkness, eliminating the mechanical horrors that roam the world, and providing a life free from "want and pain."
    - **The Narrative Bait:** At first glance, their actions support this. Early missions involve clearing cities of uncontrolled Synodic fauna and establishing reliable power grids.
    - **Control Through Dependency:** Over time, their missions shift toward absolute control. The primary mechanism is creating a total dependence on Core/Synodic technology. By providing "superior" solutions for food, protection, and energy, they render human independence impossible.
    - **Cultural Erasure:** The Core views indigenous human cultures—any belief or social structure not created or sanctioned by them—as a fundamental threat to their "Optimized Order." They actively seek to erase these cultures, replacing them with a standardized, high-tech history that supports the "Thousand-Year Fallacy."
    - **The Utopian Goal:** The endgame is to house all of humanity in "Cradle Cities"—bright, powerful metropolises built from Synodic technology where every need is met, but where individual agency and cultural memory are completely extinguished.
    - **Internal Conviction:** Unlike typical "villains," many members—including **Tor** and **Rahu**—subscribe firmly to this narrative. They believe they are the saviors of a broken species.
    - **Nomenclature (Cradle):** Internally, the organization uses the designation **"Cradle"** to refer to all primary facilities and "Life Pillars." These are the sites where the vessels are grown, monitored, or deployed.

## History
- **The Nixon Speech:** A pivotal moment where a different version of the Nixon address (or a corrupted transmission) marked the end of the "Old World" and the realization that the Apollo missions triggered a celestial retaliation.
- **The Vessel Deception:** Before the Cataclysm, the Technocratic Core used the humanoid Vessels to establish a secret New Age religion targeting the global elite. The Vessels were posed as reincarnations of exalted historical figures. They were used to influence powerful figures with "miracles" and promises of freedom from tyranny, while being kept at a distance to hide their non-human nature.
- **Cradle Zero:** The original facility built within a vast, federally reserved forest in America. This was the headquarters where Dr. Aris Vane and the Core scientists developed the Vessels. Following the Moon Cataclysm, this site was abandoned and devastated, becoming the **Desert Base** and eventually the first **Fire City**. In **Chapter 16**, the Archivists launch their first major reclamation mission from **Cradle Prime** to return to **Cradle Zero**, extinguish its "fire," and convert it into a controlled outpost.
- **The Desert Base:** The Core originally operated from **Cradle Zero**. Following the "Great Fry," this region was devastated, its forests replaced by a permanent desert. Since the base was the center of machine programming, autonomous units continued to bring fuel and energy here long after the human staff had fled or died. This created a massive, self-fueling fire—the original "Fire City"—that generates the global smog cloud.
- **Hidden in Plain Sight:** The "religion" surrounding the Vessels was cleverly masked within the existing terminology of global faiths. Terminology like "The Savior," "The Second Coming," and "The Apocalypse" allowed the movement to grow undetected within established religious frameworks. This ensured that while the public was hearing these terms, they remained ignorant of the specific physical Synthropes and their connection to the Moon until it was too late.
- **The Decade of Revelation (202X):** This decade was characterized by an overwhelming volume of leaks and revelations regarding extraterrestrial life and ancient prophecies. However, this "Media Flood" served the Core's interests; the truth was constantly lost in a sea of noise, distractions, and conflicting data, causing the public to overlook the reality of the Synodic arrival until the First Wave landed.
- **Quatrain X-72 (The Prophecy of the King of Terror):** Central to the Deception was a redacted prophecy discovered by the Core in a discredited, hard-to-access Vatican archive. 
    - **Original Text:** "In the year 1999 from heaven will come a Great King of Terror..."
    - **Modification:** As the Core's timeline slipped, they updated the date to "202X." The public received derivative versions of this prophecy throughout the 20th century, priming them for the Vessels' arrival.
    - **The Message:** The prophecy warns of wars, the disappearance of leaders, and nobles seeking "sacrifices for strange works." The Core used this to frame the Vessels as the predicted "saviors" or "tokens" that would either trigger or prevent the end of the world.

## Cosmology & The Aetheric Cycle
- **The Cosmic Life Cycle:** A model of solar system evolution where the Sun creates proto-planets through mass ejections (CMEs). These proto-planets are then captured by large gas giants like **Saturn**—which served as a "brown dwarf" mother atmosphere—where they are shielded and incubated until they drift into stable orbits or out to the far reaches of the system.
- **The Bright Path (The Snare):** The white light commonly reported in near-death experiences (NDEs) is a technical markers in the Aetheric field. It is a "Great Reward" snare designed by the Core to identify, capture, and recycle the Aetheric data (spirits) of Vessels and specialized Synanthropes. To escape this reincarnation cycle, a Vessel must "hide in the fragments"—remaining in a deactivated or spectral state in the debris until the cycle is reset or the snare is bypassed.
- **The Failed Reset:** The intent of the Lunar Capacitor's discharge was a total solar system reset—a biological and mechanical wiping that would start life anew. Because the discharge only achieved a "Great Fry" (EMP), the 202X machinery and human populations survived, albeit in a crippled and traumatized state, leading to the stagnant After Time.

## Chronology & The Calendar Shift
- **The Before Time:** The era leading up to the Moon Cataclysm (202X). Technology was at its peak before the collapse.
- **The After Time:** The era immediately following the Cataclysm.
- **The Three Calendars:** 
    - **After Time (AT):** The basic calendar used by most survivors, starting at Year 0 (The Great Fry).
    - **The "Correct" Calendar:** Used by the re-established Technocratic Core. Based on the surviving *New Chronology* book, it claims the current year is in the 1000s.
    - **The True Timeline:** Found only in the records within the Lunar Pyramid. These original records confirm that the Cataclysm occurred in the late 2020s and that only about 15 years have passed as of the story's present.
- **The Thousand-Year Fallacy:** Due to the "Great Fry" (EMP/Ionization frying most silicon chips), digital records were lost. Survival-focused survivors relied on the few physical records that remained. A widely distributed book series titled *'New Chronology'* survived the destruction; its alternate history of Earth was mistaken for factual history in a world that could no longer verify its past. This led to a widespread belief that the Cataclysm happened in '102X' rather than '202X,' effectively projecting the disaster 1,000 years into the past.
- **Lost Time:** While the reality is that the Cataclysm was recent, the majority of the population believes they are living in a distant, post-apocalyptic future where the "Old World" is ancient myth. 
- **The Continuity of the Core:** The **Archivists** are the surviving continuity of the **Technocratic Core**. Following the Great Fry, the Core was desperate to find a new base and re-establish control. In **Year 1 AT**, they re-established contact with **Iris Novak** in the **Lunar Pyramid**. This shielded structure became their new headquarters, providing a safe haven from which they could monitor the planet and manage the remnants of their technology. 
- **Alien Reconstruction:** Utilizing Synodic manufacturing, the Archivists rebuilt their lunar facilities within a few years. Because this technology grows autonomously based on elemental programming, their re-established world looks starkly non-human—as if built by alien hands rather than terrestrial scientists. This aesthetic shift further obscures their human origin from the planet's survivors.
