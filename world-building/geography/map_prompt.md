# GPT 5.2 Map Generation Prompt

Refactored to focus on **Elemental Distribution & Aetheric Resonance**.

---

### Prompt:

**System Role:** You are a master cartographer and concept artist specializing in sci-fi/fantasy world-building for the project Forgotten Future.

**Subject:** A high-resolution, annotated "Elemental Resonance Map" of the African continent in the "After Time" era, visualizing the distribution of the Five Sacred Elements (Metal, Earth, Fire, Wood, Water).

**Base Geography:**
Use the continent of **Africa** as the foundation, but apply "The Great Reconstruction" effects:
- **Coastlines:** Drastically reshaped by tectonic scarring, sea-level drops, and jagged vitrified glass-shards.
- **Continental Bridge:** The Mediterranean Sea is replaced by a hyper-arid basin of high-resonance salt flats stretching from **Tunisia to Egypt**, merging Africa with Eurasia.
- **Obsidian Heights:** The Middle East (Saudi Arabia/Jordan/Iraq) is now a range of jagged, volcanic black mountains.
- **Madagascar:** Known as the **Red Archipelago**, an isolated biological vault.

**Elemental Flux Overlays (Visual Focus):**
The map should look like a multi-layered spectral analysis or heat-map showing the saturation of elemental energy (Aetheric Resin):
1. **Metal (Cyan Neon Aura):** 68% concentration in the **Ember Basin (DRC)**, and high density along the **Great Rift Valley**.
2. **Fire (Intense Orange Glow):** 17% concentration in the **Ember Basin** (peaking at Cradle Zero) and pulsing along the **Rift Furnace (Ethiopia/Kenya)**.
3. **Wood (Luminescent Emerald Green):** 40% concentration in the **Silver Bight (Gabon/Cameroon)**, bleeding into the **White Forest**.
4. **Water (Deep Azure Ripples):** 33% concentration in the **Silver Bight** coastal regions.
5. **Earth (Deep Ochre Texture):** Distributed across the **Silver Bight** (26%) and **Ember Basin** (15%).
6. **Null-Resonance (Dark Matte Grey):** 0% activity in the **High Enclave (Morocco)** and **Dust Sea (Sahara)**, appearing as "voids" in the energy map.

**Map Locations (Annotate using real-world coordinates/analogues):**

*   **Megacities (Icon: Cyan Circle):**
    *   **Azure Zenith** (N'Djamena), **Crystalline Reach** (Khartoum), **The Glass Spires** (Cairo), **Iron Meridian** (Addis Ababa), **Radiant Dawn** (Nairobi), **The Obsidian Gate** (Luanda).
*   **Fire Cities (Icon: Orange Flame):**
    *   **Cradle Zero** (DRC), **The Salt Pillar** (Egypt), **The Steam Spire** (Douala), **The Rift Furnace** (Ethiopia/Kenya), **The Meridian Forge** (Addis Ababa).
*   **Villages (Icon: Small Grey Triangle):**
    *   **The Wuxan Pentad** clustered in the **High Atlas Mountains, Morocco**.
*   **Key Sites (Icon: Yellow Hexagon):**
    *   **Silent Forge** (DRC), **Obsidian Peak** (Kilimanjaro), **White Forest** (Gabon), **Skeleton Coast** (Namibia).

**Legends (Bottom Left Corner):**
Include a stylized digital UI legend:
1.  **Faction Key (Broken Borders):** Mark territories with dashed/dotted lines: **Core** (Cyan), **High Enclave** (Grey), **Voidsmen** (White), **Wilderness/Feral** (Rust).
2.  **Regional Elemental Profile:**
    - **Ember Basin:** Metal 68% | Earth 15% | Fire 17%
    - **Silver Bight:** Wood 40% | Water 33% | Earth 26%
    - **High Enclave:** 0% (Null-Tech)

**Style:** 
Military-grade spectral analysis display. High-contrast "Aetheric Flux" visuals. **The Cable Trail** should appear as a glowing digital lattice or circuitry connecting the Metal and Fire nodes across the continent. Atmospheric "Smoke" clouds should be rendered as data-noise patterns over industrial hotspots. 4K detail.
