# After Time (AT) Geography

In the After Time, the geography of the Earth is defined by environmental devastation, Synodic expansion, and the absence of Before Time (BT) records. Most survivors do not use old maps or location names, and common knowledge of BT continents has faded. The continent of **Alkebulan** has emerged as the most livable landmass remaining on Earth, and its name has been reclaimed by the indigenous populations while all other "Before Time" map names have been discarded as obsolete.

## Naming Conventions
- **No BT Names:** Locations are named based on their physical characteristics, climate, or historical significance in the After Time.
- **The Core's Grid:** The Core uses technical designations (e.g., "Sector 7", "Cradle Zero") which are gradually entering common parlance.

## Global Shifts (The Great Reconstruction)
The Moon Cataclysm and the subsequent Great Fry caused catastrophic tectonic shifts and sea-level drops.
- **The Continental Bridge:** The landmass of **Alkebulan** has merged with Eurasia. The former Mediterranean has vanished, replaced by a hyper-arid basin and high-resonance salt flats.
- **The Obsidian Heights:** A vast region of jagged, volcanic mountains and radioactive dead zones that serves as a massive heat-sink for the planet. All ancient map names for this area have long been discarded.

## Major AT Regions (**Alkebulan** Origin)

### The High Enclave
- **Inspiration:** Peaks of Northern **Alkebulan**.
- **Element Profile:** [No-Technology] Metal: 0% | Earth: 0% | Fire: 0% | Wood: 0% | Water: 0%
- **Description:** A jagged, alpine northern region that avoided the direct thermal blast of the Great Fry. It remains cold and relatively untouched by the desertification spreading from the south.
- **Key Site:** **Ait-Aman** (The Water Village). The central site of the **Wuxan Pentad**, Arlo's home, and the seat of the region's spiritual resistance.

### The Silver Bight
- **Inspiration:** Equatorial Coast of **Alkebulan**.
- **Element Profile:** Wood: 40% | Water: 33% | Earth: 26% | Other: 1%
- **Description:** A coastal strip caught between expanding deserts. This is a "bright area" where the atmosphere is charged with aetheric residue.
- **Key Site:** The White Forest. A luminescent sanctuary of massive "Cloud-Piercer" trees protected by the **Voidsmen**, who maintain a network of signal-dead groves.

### The Ember Basin
- **Inspiration:** Central Basin of **Alkebulan**.
- **Element Profile:** Metal: 68% | Earth: 15% | Fire: 17% | Wood: 0% | Water: 0%
- **Description:** Once a lush jungle, now a vast red-sand desert due to the persistent thermal output of the original "Pillar of Fire."
- **Key Site:** **Cradle Zero** (The Desert Base) and the **Silent Forge** (Deactivated Fire City). These facilities are dual anchors of the basin, situated approximately 50 miles apart.

### The Great Rift
- **Inspiration:** Great Rift Area of **Alkebulan**.
- **Description:** A tectonic scar that serves as the primary Equatorial Dead Zone. It is a high-traffic lane for wild Synodic migrations.

### The Dust Sea
- **Inspiration:** Northern Wastelands of **Alkebulan**.
- **Element Profile:** [No-Technology] Metal: 0% | Earth: 0% | Fire: 0% | Wood: 0% | Water: 0%
- **Description:** A hyper-arid wasteland that separates the High Enclave from the southern basins.

## The Hive Cities (Megacities)
The Core's primary population hubs, situated to consolidate control over the Ember Basin and its resource lines. **Note:** Megacities are residential and administrative hubs for humans; they are distinct from the industrial Fire Cities. While often built adjacent to a Fire City for energy proximity, they are never co-located due to the extreme thermal hazards.

- **Azure Zenith (North):** Perched on the northern transition of the Ember Basin, overseeing the drift into the Dust Sea.
- **Crystalline Reach (North):** A vertical spire-city known for its atmospheric moisture condensers.
- **The Glass Spires (Northeast):** Built atop the vitrified ruins of a Before Time metropolis, where the sand has been turned to permanent crystal.
- **Iron Meridian (East):** The central junction of the Cable Trail, serving as the primary logistics hub for the Great Rift. Adjacent to the **Meridian Forge** Fire City.
- **Radiant Dawn (East):** Situated on the edge of the Great Rift, this city uses geothermal tap-lines from the tectonic fault.
- **The Obsidian Gate (Southwest Coast):** The primary maritime hub, situated where the Ember Basin transitions into the Bight's shoreline.

## Active Fire Cities (Energy Hubs)
Massive industrial nodes that generate the global smog-cloud via the Pillars of Fire. These are automated "high-heat" zones uninhabitable by humans, serving as the power plants for the planetary grid. **Note:** Aside from the **Silent Forge** (located 50 miles from Cradle Zero), all other active Fire Cities are distributed across the continent at distances of several hundred to a thousand miles from the Ember Basin to avoid thermal saturation.

- **Cradle Zero (Ember Basin):** The progenitor site, situated in the heart of the central desert.
- **The Salt Pillar (Continental Bridge):** A colossal facility located in the Northern Salt Flats, anchoring the energy grid of the Northern Bridge.
- **The Steam Spire (Bight Perimeter):** Situated on the high-entropy edge of the **Silver Bight**, where the moisture of the White Forest meets the heat of the desert.
- **The Rift Furnace (Great Rift):** A string of thermal hubs along the **Great Rift**, siphoning tectonic energy to fuel the southern Hive Cities.
- **The Meridian Forge (East):** Adjacent to the **Iron Meridian** megacity, fueling the trans-continental Cable Trail.

## Missing & Potential Sanctuary Sites
Beyond the major sectors, other localized "hotspots" of interest remain:
- **The Obsidian Peak:** A high-altitude analog listening post used by the resistance to bypass the low-altitude smog interference.
- **The Red Archipelago:** An isolated island sector rumored to be a "Vault" for non-Synodic biological life.
- **The Skeleton Coast:** A graveyard of Before Time ships and downed Cradle-Alpha shuttles along the western shore.
- **Cradle Prime:** The primary data-hub on the remnants of the Shattered Moon.
- **The Western Wastes:** The ruins of the western continents, largely abandoned by the Core except for automated recycling operations.
