# Mission Records: The Forgotten Future

This document tracks the "Missions"—coordinated operations conducted by the Technocratic Core (Archivists) utilizing humanoid Vessels and military assets.

## Mission Interface
- **Remote Control:** During active missions, the Vessel's Aether-Drive can be remotely controlled by a mission operator (e.g., **Lia Vane**) using the **Neural Bridge**.
- **Aetheric HUD:** Real-time guidance markers, objectives, and teammate locations are projected directly into the Vessel's visual cortex.
- **Monitoring:** Missions are constantly monitored via Aetheric telemetry, with operators remaining in direct voice and data contact with the Vessels.
- **Re-creation Protocol:** If a Vessel is killed on a mission, their Aetheric signature (spirit) is returned to the base (Cradle Zero or Cradle Prime) and manifested in a new physical form. This ensures that the Archivists' primary assets are functionally immortal.

## Mission 0: The Moon Mission (202X - Day 0)
- **Objective:** Penetrate the lunar far-side base and terminate the "rogue" Vessel Rahu.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood), Lynn (Water), Rahu (Fire - Target), Tor (Earth - Commander).
- **Result:** Catastrophic failure. Success in reaching the Pyramid, but Rahu's interference triggered the "Great Fry" and the Moon's fragmentation. All Vessels except Lem were either "reset" or entered stasis.

## Mission 1: Extinguish (Year 15 AT)
- **Premise:** Reclaim the energy infrastructure of **Cradle Zero** (the original forest base) and establish a remote transponder link to the Lunar Pyramid.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Rahu (Reset/Enforcer), Tor (Commander), Metal Vessels.
- **Result:** Rahu discovered the "Staring Gorgon" (Lem) and identified him as **Mara**. The discovery triggered Rahu's logical failure and self-destruction, but Lem was successfully "captured" by the Archivists.

## Mission 2: Northern Shield (Year 15 AT)
- **Premise:** Respond to "distress calls" from northern human settlements reported via tech beacons. The objective is to protect these villages from "Wild" Gorgon / Synodic incursions launched from the Moon fragments.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood - First deployment after recovery), Metal Vessels, human infantry.
- **The Secret:** The distress calls are manufactured by the Core using covertly installed beacons. The missions are designed to force human dependency on the Archivists and justify military occupation.
- **The Gorgon pods:** Gorgons launch themselves in pods from the moon's far-side fragments. Their trajectories bend toward Earth, often landing impact-sites miles from human settlements.
- **Discovery:** In one village, Lem observes a group of Tripods (Gorgons) ignoring the humans entirely. They are clearly traveling toward a destination of their own until attacked by a Metal Vessel.
- **The Refusal (Arlo):** A young villager named **Arlo** refuses a prestigious Core recruitment offer after witnessing the unprovoked attack on the Tripods, marking the first major public rejection of the "False Hero" narrative.
- **Result:** Lem's refusal to accept the mission narrative and his persistent questioning—bolstered by Arlo's defiance—leads to him being pulled from Mission 2 and prepped for Mission 3.

## Mission 3: Aggressive Expansion (Year 15 AT)
- **Location:** The Desert Base (Cradle Zero) and surrounding Equatorial Dead Zone.
- **Premise:** Transition from border protection to overt colonial expansion. The goal is to clear a hundreds-of-miles radius around Cradle Zero of "wild" Monoliths and Synodics to build the first "Utopian Cities."
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood), Tor (Earth), Metal Vessel legions.
- **Tools:** Hover bikes, massive beacons (Synodic Disruption Beacons).
- **The Opposition: "Wild" Synodics:** Indigenous mechanical life that has evolved beyond Core control. They are a complex blend of all five elements and have adapted to the loss of the central Fire City's energy.
- **Enslavement & Authorization:** While evolved, these Synodics still contain encrypted "Safety Locks" and programming from their origin. The Core utilizes specific authorization keys to "hijack" and enslave Gorgons to act as automated labor for the city construction.
- **The Cycle of Death:** The mission is extremely high-risk. Massive Monoliths react with explosive violence when approached by beacon-deployment teams. Lem and other Vessels die multiple times during the "clearing" phase, but are instantly reincarnated at the Desert Base and sent back to the front lines.
- **Lem's Perspective:** For the first time since his recovery, Lem feels a sense of purpose. The Archivists frame the mission as bringing order and abundance to a broken world. He wins significant acclaim for his persistence and physical skill, leading him to believe he is actually a hero.
- **Result:** Successful clearing of the zone. Automated construction of elaborate, resource-rich cities begins.

## Mission 4: The White Forest (Year 15 AT)
- **Location:** A mysterious mechanical forest in the northern hemisphere.
- **Premise:** Infiltration of a "White Forest"—a vast, artificial ecosystem of white electronic trees where all previous Core incursions have vanished.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood - Solo Infiltration).
- **The Mystery:** Metal Vessels deployed on prior reconnaissance missions disappeared without a trace. Their built-in surveillance beacons and remote telemetry were jamming/severed by an unknown force.
- **The Objective:** Determine the source of the transmissions jamming and the fate of the missing Metal Vessels.
- **Vessel Reasoning:** Lem is chosen for this mission at the height of his fame following Mission 3. The Core believes his "Wood" element and unique "Bourne Profile" will allow him to navigate the artificial forest where the cold logic of Metal units failed.
- **Strategic Note:** The Core suspects a connection between the forest and an unmanaged, highly advanced indigenous population or Synodic variation.
