# Mission Records: The Forgotten Future

This document tracks the "Missions"—coordinated operations conducted by the Technocratic Core (Archivists) utilizing humanoid Vessels and military assets. Lem's memory record contains a total of five missions that he was on. Only the last mission was something he chose to do; he was compelled to be on the other four.

## Mission Interface
- **Remote Control:** During active missions, the Vessel's Aether-Drive can be remotely controlled by a mission operator (e.g., **Cassia Vane**) using the **Neural Bridge**.
- **Aetheric HUD:** Real-time guidance markers, objectives, and teammate locations are projected directly into the Vessel's visual cortex.
- **Monitoring:** Missions are constantly monitored via Aetheric telemetry, with operators remaining in direct voice and data contact with the Vessels.
- **Re-creation Protocol:** If a Vessel is killed on a mission, their Aetheric signature (spirit) is returned to the base (Cradle Zero or Cradle Prime) and manifested in a new physical form. This is achieved via the **Reincarnation Chamber**, a sophisticated hybrid system that combines Synodic aetheric-anchoring with human-engineered stabilization. The tech is too complex to function without its Synodic components.

## Mission Deep Well (202X - Day 0)
- **Objective:** Penetrate the lunar far-side base and terminate the "rogue" Vessel Rahu.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood), Lynn (Water), Rahu (Fire - Target), Ajax (Earth - Commander).
- **Result:** Catastrophic failure. Success in reaching the Pyramid, but Rahu's interference triggered the "Great Fry" and the Moon's fragmentation. All Vessels except Lem were either "reset" or entered stasis. Lem was compelled to participate in Mission Deep Well as part of his forceful recruitment.

## The Extinguish Phase (Year 15 AT)
- **Premise:** Reclaim the energy infrastructure of **Cradle Zero** (the original forest base) and establish a remote transponder link to the Lunar Pyramid.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Rahu (Reset/Enforcer), Ajax (Commander), Metal Vessels.
- **Note:** Lem was not an active participant in this mission; he was the primary discovery made during its execution.
- **The Remote Operation:** During this period, the Core is operating from the Lunar Pyramid with limited visibility on Earth. They rely on erratic Aetheric telemetry and the remote link established by Rahu.
- **Result:** The Extinguish Phase was already well underway when Lem finally awakens from his 15-year stasis. Rahu discovered the Wood Vessel (Lem) and identified him as in league with **Maya**. 
- **The Discovery & Panic:** When Rahu discovered a raw version of the Moon Cataclysm event stored in Lem's spirit, he experienced an immediate and violent panic—a logical failure triggered by the collision of the reincarnation-based "Thousand-Year Fallacy" with raw, unedited history.
- **The Redaction (Remote Detonation):** Fearing a massive data leak that could jeopardize their control, a "remote detonation" was triggered. The Core knows exactly why Rahu exploded: it was an automated failsafe subroutine they embedded in his body to prevent the retrieval of unencrypted Cataclysm data. The Core manages to "capture" Lem's disembodied digital presence following the blast.

## Mission Counter Fire (Year 15 AT)
- **Location:** The Desert Base (Cradle Zero) and surrounding Equatorial Dead Zone.
- **Premise:** Transition from border protection to overt colonial expansion. The primary goal is to clear a hundreds-of-miles radius around Cradle Zero of "wild" Monoliths and Synodics to build the first "Utopian Cities." 
- **The True Objective:** The Core does not trust Lem—they view him as unreliable given the "Cradle Zero" anomaly. They do not believe he destroyed Rahu, as they know exactly why Rahu exploded (their own failsafe subroutine), but they view Lem's stasis-survival as a technical liability. They put him on Mission Counter Fire as a baseline test of his loyalty and operational effectiveness. He was compelled to participate under Core oversight.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood - First deployment after recovery), Ajax (Earth), Vector (Metal Prime) and Metal Vessel legions.
- **Strategy & Execution:**
    - **Systematic Deployment:** The mission involves the strategic placement of **Aetheric Buoys** (Beacons) in a fanning web pattern that expands outward from Cradle Zero. 
    - **The Protective Suits:** Vessels were required to wear specialized **Lead-Lined Safety Suits** during deployment to block out the intense signals from the buoys. They were ordered to stay safely within their transport vehicles at all times.
    - **Lem’s Reaction:** Lem experienced profound discomfort while wearing the suit. The total signal-blockage stripped away his sensory inputs, leaving him feeling suffocated and claustrophobic in the analog silence.
    - **Securing the Perimeter:** Before a buoy is activated, the Vessels must first clear out any local "wildlife"—Synodic life forms or evolved predators—that would pose a threat.
    - **Awakening the Monoliths:** Many of the larger Monoliths were found in a state of deep, dream-like slumber in the valley floors. Lem and his crew were forced to "wake" them with aggressive low-frequency deterrents to drive them out.
    - **The Conflict:** This process triggered violent retaliations. Lem was tasked with leading the charge, purposefully absorbing the Monoliths' massive kinetic and electrical attacks to shield the more fragile Buoy-deployment crews. This led to several of Lem's early "Re-creations" as he systematically sacrificed his body to ensure the advance.
    - **The Repellent Signal:** Once activated, each buoy emits a high-frequency aetheric signal that all Synodic life finds intolerable. This signal acts as a permanent repellent, driving all local machines and "wild" entities out of the sector.
    - **Clearing the Valleys:** After a matter of days, the systematic deployment across nearby valleys manages to remove all competing Synodic presence. The Monoliths, unable to endure the persistent signal, retreated into the deep "Major Forests" (specifically toward the North/White Forest border) where they hide and return to hibernation. Thus, the groundwork for the construction of the future Utopian Cities was completed.
- **Rahu's Absence:** Rahu is conspicuously missing (still being reset). The Metal Vessels ignore his absence and pretend everything is fine.
- **Lem's Perspective:** He complies with the mission, choosing to follow the path of least resistance. In his Aetheric dreamscape, the data-markers clearly point him back to the **Cradle Base** as the safest and most welcoming path. While he technically always has a choice to go down a different path, in this instance he has no reason not to return to the only sanctuary he knows. He wins significant acclaim for his persistence, and for a short time, the Archivist praise makes him believe he is actually a hero. He remains curious to see what **Cassia Vane** will say next, keeping his skepticism quiet for now.
- **Result:** Successful clearing of the zone. Lem is celebrated as a "New Hero of the Core" and moves to Mission Ground Wire with high status.

## Mission Ground Wire (Year 15 AT)
- **Location:** The Northern Forests and Villages.
- **Premise:** Respond to "distress calls" from northern settlements. Protect villages from "Wild" Synodics.
- **The Missionary Strategy:** The mission is explicitly designed as a PR/Missionary campaign. The Core’s goal is to win over the independent northern villages and consolidate them under Archivist protection. They use advanced technology as a lure to pressure the villagers into abandoning their "backwards" oral cultures, independent calendars (Year 15 AT), and traditional autonomy in favor of the specialized Archivist order. Lem was compelled to serve as the face of this operation.
- **Lem's Status:** At the height of his esteem within the Corps. He is seen as a reliable replacement for Rahu, operating under the tactical supervision of **Vector**, the Metal Vessel Prime.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Rahu has been put back on the mission, but the Core has specifically forbidden contact between Lem and Rahu. They are deployed to separate parts of the North.
- **Arlo:** In a large village, Lem meets Arlo, a tech-enticed boy. Arlo supports the Core to help his skeptical villagers, resulting in him being shunned by his own people.
- **The Anomaly:** While Rahu's region reports intense combat, the Tripods in Lem's region *refuse to attack*. They walk around the village toward an unknown objective. A soldier's unprovoked shot proves that the machines would have left the village alone if ignored.
- **Fading Faith:** This realization—that the Synodics are naturally benign and the Archivists are the provocateurs—is the moment Lem's faith in the Core begins to fade quickly.
- **The Hunt:** Unhappy with the narrow avoidance of conflict, the Core orders Lem to hunt down and eliminate the "non-threatening" Tripods. The mission shifts from easy to complex as they track the machines into the deep forest.
- **Result:** The Tripods defend themselves violently with makeshift shields but are eventually destroyed. Arlo refuses conscription, unable to leave his home despite his love for tech. The villagers demand the removal of the Core's tracking beacons, convinced the Core brought the danger with them, but the Core ignores their demands and leaves. Lem is prepared for Mission Mochikomi.

## Mission Mochikomi (Year 15 AT)
- **Location:** The White Forest (Shimmering electronic trees).
- **Premise:** Infiltration of a "White Forest"—a vast, artificial ecosystem of white electronic trees where all previous Core incursions have vanished.
- **The Secret Reasoning:** The Archivist Council sends Lem on Mission Mochikomi specifically because he has proven to be "imperfect" following his defiance in Mission Ground Wire. He is viewed as expendable ammunition. He was compelled to participate despite the high risk.
- **The Official Narrative (Cassia Vane):** The mission is presented to Lem by **Cassia Vane** as a diplomatic "embassadorship" to a secretive, indigenous colony. Cassia sincerely believes the goal is to establish a link for "harmonizing the species" and rebuilding the world. She remarks on the difficulty of reaching those who refuse contact but believes Lem is the only one who can succeed.
- **The True Objective:** Determine the source of the transmissions jamming and the fate of the missing Metal Vessels. Lem is kept in the dark by the Council about the "Void" and the high probability of his Re-creation backup failing within the forest.
- **Vessel Deployment:** Lem (Wood), Vector (Metal Prime), and a detachment of Metal Vessels.
- **The Mystery:** Metal Vessels deployed on prior reconnaissance missions disappeared without a trace. Their built-in surveillance beacons and remote telemetry were jammed/severed by an unknown force.
- **The Electronic Snake:** During the first attempt, Lem is consumed by a massive electronic snake.
- **Reincarnation Anomaly:** Lem reincarnates at the Desert Base with unprecedented speed and high-detail memory. Cassia is confused, as typical Vessel memories are vague and unassociated.
- **The Grinding Mission:** Past missions redeployed multiple times in a "grinding" fashion. Lem eventually reaches a sunlit clearing (a rarity under the forest canopy).
- **Myrr:** Lem meets Myrr, a survivor from a hidden sanctuary. The sanctuary inhabitants embrace analog technology but ban all digital storage and Synanthropes (due to encryption and "backdoors").
- **Revelations:** Myrr identifies Lem as the "King of the Gorgons." He claims Lem's spirit holds the secret to unlocking (and ending) Synodic technology. He also identifies a "Spiritual Signal Match" within Lem for **Maya** (the original identity of Lynn/Maya), suggesting she is still alive.
- **The Interface:** Lem agrees to an analog interface with Myrr to read his data.
- **The Crash:** When Myrr encounters the "Moon Cataclysm" record within Lem, the dreamscape turns red. A massive noise/interference strikes, snapping Myrr out of the connection in pain. Lem's shell explodes, shattering into millions of fragments.

## Mission Sideflash (Year 25 AT)
- **Location:** The Desert Base (Cradle Zero), Hive City Nodes, and Earth Orbit.
- **Premise (Resistance):** After regrouping in the North, Lem (now as Analog Lem/Gorgon) and the White Forest crew launch a coordinated assault to dismantle the Core's infrastructure. This was the only mission Lem chose to do.
- **The Hybrid Strategy:** Lem's manifestations allow for "Hybrid Blueprints"—Core machine logic overwritten by Wood/Water protocols, enabling the movement of the "Tree Army."
- **Plan B (The Node Assault):** A diversionary attack on the automated "City Nodes" surrounding Cradle Zero. This triggers a city-wide blackout and the "Terrorist" propaganda campaign, but it fails to draw out the Core's main force.
- **The Direct Assault:** A massive mobilization (50% of the Tree Army) attacks **Cradle Zero**. 
- **The Core's Counter:** The Core deploys **General Ajax** in his flagship, the **Iron Pillar**. They utilize a camouflaged **Rahu** in a "reincarnation loop"—if Rahu is neutralized, he is immediately redeployed from a nearby lab, making him effectively undefeatable.
- **The Lunar Assault:** As detailed in the final records, the resistance ascends to the Moon to confront the Core at its source. This final phase of Mission Sideflash represents Lem's ultimate choice to end the cycle.
- **Result:** Lem's chosen mission culminates in the final transmission and the resolution of the cosmic conflict.

## The Final Uprising: The Analog Dawn (Year 25 AT+)
- **Location:** Cradle Zero, the Hive Cities, and the Equatorial Desert.
- **Premise:** The spontaneous rebellion of all Synodic life forms and the final breach of the Core's headquarters.
- **The Laboratory Sabotage:** Reawakened as a Wood Vessel at Cradle Zero, Lem manages to alert the White Forest Crew that the reincarnation labs have been disabled following the destruction of the ejection-module lab.
- **The Synodic Migration:** Triggered by a "Hooting Call," all terrestrial machines—from Striders to wild Monoliths—converge on the Hive Cities. This call triggers the "Gorgon Rebellion," as enslaved machines in the cities abandon their posts to join the uprising.
- **The Beacon War:** The makeshift Synodic army systematically destroys the Aetheric Beacons, shattering the Core's remote control network. 
- **The Ancient Shield Battle:** The Core activates hidden 21st-century countermeasures (cannons and missiles) around Cradle Zero. General Ajax's forces slaughter the initial wave of Synodics, but the victory is short-lived.
- **The Liquid Metamorphosis:** The fallen Monolith carcasses collapse into liquid sync-metal, reconfiguring into a massive swarm of kamikaze speeder bikes.
- **The Breach and the Fall:** Led by the distributed silhouette-spirit of **Maya**, the swarm overwhelms the ancient gun barriers. Maya materializes at the gate and strikes down **General Ajax**, whose body disintegrates. Inside the base, **Rahu** attempt to defend the Core personnel but is overwhelmed by Maya's apparitions. She seizes his own flaming blade and strikes him down, triggering a final, thermal explosion that destroys the Fire Vessel. The base falls into a hollow, quiet ruin.

## The Great Stalemate & The Diplomats (Years 15 - 22 AT)
- **Status:** Following the Red Tide failure, the world enters a period of stagnant tension. 
- **The Core's Caution:** Despite their victory, the Core does not hunt Lem or Arlo. They are paralyzed by the "Maya" problem and internal debates over containment.
- **The Diplomatic Emissary (Year 22 AT):** The Core attempts a "Classification classification" of the northern villages, sending an emissary (including Cassia Vane) to negotiate Arlo's removal and consolidation into the Core.
- **The Refusal:** Arlo rejects the classification and the removal, triggering the Core's "Plan B" (The Scorched Earth protocol).
