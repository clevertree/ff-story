# Appendix: Vessel History

**Source:** Recovered Logs / Archival Context

This appendix contains the detailed background, history, and lore records mentioned during Lem's aetheric transitions.

## Archival Record: The Prophetess (Late 20th Century)
In the late 20th century, The Core had Selene (Lynn) visit specific locations to create a strategic religious spread. As Selene, Lynn played the part of a reincarnated Spirit, winning over skeptics through perceived benevolence. She spoke of a coming apocalypse but insisted the only way to prepare was spiritually.

## Archival Record: The Religion
The Core had no problem with her pushing a reincarnation religion, especially since they were trying to convince everyone that these were reincarnated spirits. Lynn’s version utilized the concept of Wuxan—the five elements—for all life, though the Core’s later variants omitted these to keep Synodic technology classified.

## Archival Record: The Ambassador (1971)
In 1971, Rahu was embedded within the Apollo crews as a humanoid asset. He believed himself to be Earth's first official ambassador to the stars, sent to establish a research outpost. 

## Archival Record: The Betrayal & The Reclamation
Unknown even to Rahu, his "mission" was a cover; his optical and sensory feeds were being used by the Technocratic Core to plan for the removal of the indigenous Selenites. When Rahu discovered he was a pawn and attempted to expose them, the Core triggered the remote Reclamation Protocol, shattering his body into millions of metal shards on the lunar surface.

## Archival Record: The Far Side (Cradle Alpha)
Rahu remanifested at the Far Side base, Cradle Alpha. From this advantageous position, Rahu stalled the Core's plans for decades, as they could neither control the remote base nor remove him without risking primary lunar infrastructure.

## Archival Record: Strategic Sabotage
Lynn realized early on that the Core was building a global trap. She identified the Lunar Capacitor as the primary control node for the eventual global "Reset." Her return to the mission was not an act of service, but the first step in a multi-decade plan to sabotage the Synodic resonance before it could solidify.

## Archival Record: The Core Infiltration
Lynn successfully gained reentry into the Core's inner circle by simulating tactical successes in the outer colonies using Lem's navigation data. Her popularity with the human population during the "Selene" years made it politically impossible for the Core to refuse her a seat at the Council of Progenitors.
