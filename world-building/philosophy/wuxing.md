## Names

| Language | Name |
|----------|------|
| **Chinese** (漢字) | 五行 |
| **Pinyin** | wǔxíng |
| **Vietnamese** | ngũ hành (五行) |
| **Korean** | 오행 (ohaeng) |
| **Japanese** | 五行 (gogyō) |

## Overview

**Wuxing** (Chinese: 五行; pinyin: *wǔxíng*; Jyutping: *Ng5 Hang4*), translated as **Five Moving Ones**, **Five Circulations**, **Five Types of Energy**, **Five Elements**, **Five Transformations**, **Five Phases** or **Five Agents**, is a fivefold conceptual scheme used in many traditional Chinese fields of study to explain a wide array of phenomena, including terrestrial and celestial relationships, influences, and cycles, that characterise the interactions and relationships within [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_China), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism), [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) and social relationships and education within [Chinese culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_culture).

The **Five Moving Ones** are traditionally associated with the classical planets: [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars), [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)), [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter), [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus), and [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn). When in their "heavenly stems" generative cycle (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), they run clockwise. When in their overacting destructive arrangement of Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, Metal, natural disasters, calamity, illnesses and disease will ensue.

The *wuxing* system has been in use since the second or first century BCE during the [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty). It appears in [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_China), [feng shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui), [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_alchemy), [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astrology), [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts), [military strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War), *[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching)* divination, [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Taoism) and [traditional medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), serving as a [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) based on [cosmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cosmology) analogy.

## Etymology

*Wuxing* originally referred to the five [classical planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet) (from brightest to dimmest: [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus), [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter), [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)), [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars), [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn)), which with the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) and [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) were conceived as creating the five forces of earthly life (including [yang and yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_and_yin)). The word is composed of Chinese characters meaning "five" (五; *wǔ*) and "moving" (行; *xíng*). "Moving" is shorthand for "planets" — the word for planets in Chinese is "moving stars" (行星; *xíngxīng*).

Some of the [Mawangdui Silk Texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawangdui_Silk_Texts) (before 168 BCE) also connect the *wuxing* to the *wude* (五德; *wǔdé*), the [Five Virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue) and Five Emotions. Scholars believe various predecessors to the concept were merged into one system in the [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty).

**Translations:** "Five Elements" (common in TCM), "five phases" (Nathan Sivin, 1987), "Evolutive Phase" (Manfred Porkert), "five agents" or "five transformations" (widely accepted among modern scholars). The element "[Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(wuxing))" is more accurately thought of as the "[vital essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital)" and growth of trees rather than physical wood.

## Cycles

The five phases are connected in two cycles of interactions:
- **Generative cycle** (相生 *xiāngshēng*) — "mother-son"
- **Destructive cycle** (克 *kè*) — "grandfather-grandson"

### Inter-promoting (Generative)

The generative cycle (相生 *xiāngshēng*):

- Wood feeds Fire as fuel
- Fire produces Earth (ash, lava)
- Earth bears Metal (geological processes produce minerals)
- Metal collects, filters and purifies Water (e.g., water vapor condenses on metal)
- Water nourishes Wood (water leads to growth of plants)

### Inter-regulating (Destructive)

The destructive cycle (相克 *xiāngkè*):

- Wood grasps (or stabilizes) Earth (roots prevent soil erosion)
- Earth contains (or directs) Water (dams, river banks)
- Water dampens (or regulates) Fire
- Fire melts (or refines or shapes) Metal
- Metal chops (or carves) Wood

### Overacting

The excessive destructive cycle (相乘 *xiāngchéng*):

- Wood depletes Earth (over-farming, overcultivation)
- Earth obstructs Water (over-damming)
- Water extinguishes Fire
- Fire melts Metal (affecting integrity)
- Metal makes Wood rigid to easily snap

### Weakening

The reverse generative cycle (相洩/相泄 *xiāngxiè*):

- Wood depletes Water
- Water rusts Metal
- Metal impoverishes Earth (erosion, destructive mining)
- Earth smothers Fire
- Fire burns Wood (forest fires)

### Counteracting

Reverse/deficient destructive cycle (相侮 *xiāngwǔ* or 相耗 *xiānghào*):

- Wood dulls Metal
- Metal de-energizes Fire (conducting heat away)
- Fire evaporates Water
- Water muddies (or destabilizes) Earth
- Earth rots Wood (buried wood rots)

### Ming nayin

In [Ziwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zi_wei_dou_shu) divination, *nayin* (納音) classifies the Five Elements into 60 *ming* (命), or life orders, based on the [ganzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzhi). Similar to the astrology zodiac, the *ming* is used by fortune-tellers to analyse personality and destiny.

### Cosmology and Feng Shui

Main article: [Feng shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui)

The art of feng shui (Chinese [geomancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomancy)) is based on *wuxing*, with the cosmos mirroring the five phases, as well as [bagua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua) (eight [trigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram_(I_Ching))).

| Movement | Metal | Wood | Water | Fire | Earth |

| Color | White | Green | Black | Red | Yellow |
| Day | Friday | Thursday | Wednesday | Tuesday | Saturday |
| Season | Autumn | Spring | Winter | Summer | Intermediate |
| Direction | West | East | North | South | Center |

### Dynastic Transitions

According to [Zou Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zou_Yan) (c. 305–240 BCE), each element possesses a personified virtue (德; *dé*), indicating the foreordained destiny (運; *yùn*) of a dynasty. The [Mandate of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven) sanctions legitimacy through auspicious signs in ritual colors (white, green, black, red, yellow) matching the element. From the Qin dynasty onward, most Chinese dynasties invoked the Five Elements to legitimize their reign.

## In Japan

The Japanese term is *gogyo* (五行; gogyō). During the 5th–6th centuries ([Kofun period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun_period)), Japan adopted [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism), [Chinese Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism), and [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism) through monks and physicians from China, evolving the *[Onmyōdō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onmy%C5%8Dd%C5%8D)* system. The theory of [Godai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godai_(Japanese_philosophy)) is a form-based philosophy introduced via India and Tibetan Buddhism. These theories are practiced in Japanese [acupuncture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture) and [Kampo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampo) medicine.
