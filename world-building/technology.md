# After Time Technology

Technology in the AT is a battleground between the Core's digital optimization and the resistance's analog preservation.

## The Cable Trail
Massive physical conduits that stretch across continents.
- **Wireless Failure:** The shattering of the Moon and the subsequent magnetic shifts made reliable long-range wireless communication impossible. 
- **Physical Hard-Wiring:** The Cable Trail provides a high-bandwidth physical network for data and energy.
- **Energy Diversion:** By distributing power through the Trail, the Core keeps the high-heat generation of the Fire Cities in isolated deserts (like the Ember Basin), protecting human outposts from thermal supercriticality.

## Wood-Water (Analog Tech)
Used primarily by the **Voidsmen** of the White Forest.
- **Wave-Based:** Operates on frequencies and resonance rather than digital bits.
- **Energy-Conduits:** Unlike the Core's data-driven networks, Voidsman technology is focused on the movement of **Energy**. Signals are used to transfer heat and power between trees and dwellings, but they purposefully lack the "encryption" and "metadata" required for communication or surveillance.
- **Luminescent Trees:** Bio-mechanical organisms that provide heat and light.
- **Cloud-Piercers:** The largest White Forest trees reach into the clouds, gathering aetheric energy and networking it to the rest of the forest via root-signals. They provide sustinence and warmth even when the "Fire City Smog" blankets the sky.
- **The Analog Guard:** Voidsmen respect energy as a sacred force, tapping into it sparingly to avoid the "Thermal Corruption" that defines the Fire Cities. 
- **Rapid Growth:** White Forest "trees" can be programmed for mobile growth, allowing the forest to shift or reclaim land in response to Core incursions.

## Synodic Technology
- **Gorgons & Tripods:** Autonomous machines that originally served humanity but are now largely "wild" or repurposed by the Core.
- **Pillars of Fire:** Massive energy hubs that generate the global smog cloud.
- **Instant Reincarnation:** A Core protocol that pulls a Vessel's consciousness through a data-snare (The Welcoming Path) to a repository like Cradle Zero for reconstruction.
