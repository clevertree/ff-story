# Master Timeline: Forgotten Future

This document tracks the chronological order of events to ensure narrative causality and consistency.

**The Two Calendars:**
- **Actual Time (AT):** The objective timeline. The Cataclysm happened at Year 0.
- **After Pulse (PF):** The internal calendar used by Core citizens, placing the story 1,000 years in the future to maintain the "Fallacy." (Year 1015 PF = Year 15 AT).

## Era: Pre-Cataclysm (-75 to 0 AT)

- **-75 AT (1947):** **The Synodic Foundation.** Dr. Elowen Vane (age 25) initiates a secret project to develop self-building machine (SBM) shards using her breakthrough theories on aetheric resonance.
- **-74 to -55 AT:** **The Wuxing Implementation.** Against the recommendations of the male scientific establishment, Vane implements "Eastern Lore" and Wuxing causality into the SBM programming. While her peers dismiss her theories as "fairytales," Vane is granted unusual autonomy and leadership—partly due to her terrifying intellect, and partly because her attractiveness makes her a useful public and political face for the project's funding.
- **-54 AT (1968):** **The Birth of the Vessels.** The four Original Vessels (Lem, Rahu, Lynn, and Tor) are "born" in the lab. Vane refuses Core demands to create a fifth "Metal" Vessel, fearing that the element of Metal—associated with absolute rigidity and lack of empathy—would create a weapon she could not control.
- **-51 AT (1971):** **The Selenite Removal.** The Technocratic Core launches a secret campaign to forcibly remove the indigenous Selenites from the Moon. Under the cover of the Apollo 14 mission, they "infect" the Moon with the first Synodic shards.
- **-50 to -16 AT:** **The Great Silence.** The Selenites are gone. The Moon is a terrestrial test-bed. 
- **-15 AT:** **The Moon Growth.** Core scientists monitor machine growth on the Moon's Far Side via remote subroutines.
- **-5 AT:** **The Vessel Deception.** Lem is placed into suburban anonymity to test long-term "human" integration.
- **Year 0:** **The Cataclysm.** The Moon Base is activated. The "Great Fry" (EMP pulse) resets Earth's digital infrastructure. 15 years of "The Long Night" begin.

## Era: The Thousand-Year Fallacy (0 - 15 AT)

- **Year 1-5 AT:** **The Archivist Claim.** The Core (led by Elowen's digital archive) re-establishes power in Hive Cities. They create "The Thousand-Year Fallacy," teaching humans that the Fall happened 1,000 years ago to erase the memory of the 21st century.
- **Year 10 AT:** **Mission 1 (The Fire Cities).** The first deployment of "Redundant" Vessels (Lem iterations) to reclaim power plants.
- **Year 14 AT:** **Mission 2-4.** Lem (Unit 01) is repeatedly deployed and destroyed to test the boundaries of the "Format." 
- **Year 15 AT (Book Start):** **The Awakening.** Lem awakens at Cradle Zero (Ch 11). He meets the Northern Resistance and discovers the "Strayed Gardeners" (Gorgon units).
- **Year 15 AT (Mid):** **The Great Refusal.** Lem breaks his "Slave Protocols" and joins the Resistance (Ch 23). The "Great Stalemate" begins.

## Era: The Great Stalemate (15 - 25 AT)

- **Year 15-24 AT:** **The Cultural Cold War.** The Hive Cities remain under the Fallacy. The North remains independent under Lem and Arlo (Water-Vessel proxy).
- **Year 24 AT:** **The Siege of Cradle Zero.** A failed attempt by the Resistance to take the Core's terrestrial heart.

---

## Era: The Final Assault (Year 25 AT)

- **Month 1:** **The Invisible Front.** The Core initiates the "Sanitization" of the North.
- **Month 2:** **The Death of Arlo.** The Core strikes the Resistance with orbital beams. Arlo dies, releasing the "Maya Match" (Ch 29).
- **Month 3:** **The Rebirth of Maya.** Maya manifests in the Cradle Zero labs as the "Witch Maya" (Ch 30).
- **Month 4:** **The Breakthrough.** The Fall of the General (Tor). The Resistance reaches the Mission 3 launch site (Ch 31).
- **Month 5:** **Mission 5 (Lunar).** Lem and Maya launch for the Moon (Ch 32).
- **Month 6:** **The Loom of Memory.** The confrontation with the Director (Elowen). Lem sacrifices his physical form to "ground" the Core's capacitor (Ch 33).
- **Month 6 (End):** **The Final Transmission.** The silver threads of memory return to Earth. The Fallacy ends. The first morning of the new world (Ch 34).

## Legacy (25 AT+)
- **The Forest Growth:** The White Forest begins to turn green.
- **The Wild Synodics:** The Gorgon units become part of the natural landscape.
- **The Records:** The *Forgotten Future* manuscript is preserved as the definitive account of the transition.
