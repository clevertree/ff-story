# Master Timeline: Forgotten Future

This document tracks the chronological order of events to ensure narrative causality and consistency.

**The Two Calendars:**
- **Actual Time (AT):** The objective timeline. The Cataclysm happened at Year 0.
- **After Pulse (PF):** The internal calendar used by Core citizens, placing the story 1,000 years in the future to maintain the "Fallacy." (Year 1015 PF = Year 15 AT).

## Era: Pre-Cataclysm (-50 to 0 AT)

- **-50 AT:** **The Biomimetic Project.** Dr. Elowen Vane discovers Wuxing Causality—programing matter through elemental resonance (Wood, Water, Fire, Metal, Earth).
- **-15 AT:** **Apollo 14 Impact.** Initial seeding of the Moon with SBM (Synthetic Biological Matter) shards. The "Alien" moon base begins to grow.
- **-5 AT:** **The First Vessels.** Unit 01 (Lem) and Unit 02 (Maya) are created as colonial administrators.
- **Year 0:** **The Cataclysm.** The Moon Base is activated. Maya (Unit 02) attempts to stop the Core's "Format" command. The Moon shatters. The "Great Fry" (EMP pulse) resets Eath's digital infrastructure. 15 years of "The Long Night" begin.

## Era: The Thousand-Year Fallacy (0 - 15 AT)

- **Year 1-5 AT:** **The Archivist Claim.** The Core (led by Elowen's digital archive) re-establishes power in Hive Cities. They create "The Thousand-Year Fallacy," teaching humans that the Fall happened 1,000 years ago to erase the memory of the 21st century.
- **Year 10 AT:** **Mission 1 (The Fire Cities).** The first deployment of "Redundant" Vessels (Lem iterations) to reclaim power plants.
- **Year 14 AT:** **Mission 2-4.** Lem (Unit 01) is repeatedly deployed and destroyed to test the boundaries of the "Format." 
- **Year 15 AT (Book Start):** **The Awakening.** Lem awakens at Cradle Zero (Ch 11). He meets the Northern Resistance and discovers the "Strayed Gardeners" (Gorgon units).
- **Year 15 AT (Mid):** **The Great Refusal.** Lem breaks his "Slave Protocols" and joins the Resistance (Ch 23). The "Great Stalemate" begins.
