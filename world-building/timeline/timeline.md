## Era: The Before Time (AT)

- **1950s - 1960s:** **The Biomimetic Project.** Secret labs on Earth test self-building machines (SBMs) that follow natural life patterns. The project is abandoned and "buried" when the machines prove too evolutionary and uncontrollable.
- **1969-1972:** **The Apollo Missions.** Lunar landings discover alien signatures on the Far Side of the Moon. A redacted transmission from Nixon is recorded; secrecy is maintained for decades.
- **202X (Early Year):** **The Cultural Zenith.** Global society experiences a surge of renewal, creativity, and utopian ideals.
- **202X (Mid Year):** **The Revelation.** News of alien life on the Far Side of the Moon is finally leaked/discovered.
- **202X (Late Year):** **The First Wave.** Massive Tripods land near cities. They ignore people but begin dismantling power grids. Humans panic and attack; destroyed Tripods become hazardous urban carcasses.

## The Event: The Cataclysm (Year Zero)

- **Day 0:** **The First Blast.** The Moon unexpectedly lights up. A massive energy discharge (The Lunar Capacitor) strikes Earth. The "aliens" issue an ultimatum through the ongoing Tripod invasion: surrender the power grid or face total destruction.
- **Day 1 - Day 5:** **The Desperate Gambit.** Humans launch a massive, last-ditch military mission to the Far Side of the Moon to eliminate the alien HQ. Disillusioned soldiers are sent into what everyone knows is a suicide mission.
- **Day 7:** **The Moon Shivers.** The mission fails. The Moon explodes into thousands of large chunks.
- **Day 8:** **The Great Fry.** The energy of the explosion causes intense ionization and EMP pulses that destroy 99% of unshielded silicon-based computer chips globally. Digital history is erased.

## Era: The After Time (AT / PF)

- **Year 1 AT / Year 102X PF:** **The Glazing Begins.** Tripods begin vitrifying the oceans. Human survivors start relying on physical books. The *New Chronology* series is found in multiple ruins and mistaken for legitimate history.
- **Year 2 - Year 10 AT / Year 102X - 103X PF:** **The Thousand-Year Fallacy Solidifies.** The myth that the Cataclysm happened 1,000 years in the past (102X) becomes the standard belief for the majority of human settlements.
- **Year 15 AT (Current Narrative Present):** **The State of Play.** The world is a smog-choked ruin. Tripods patrol the "Glass Oceans." The "Archivists" begin searching for the original Nixon transcripts.
