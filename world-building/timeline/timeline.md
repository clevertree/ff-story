## Era: The Before Time (AT)

- **1950s - 1960s:** **The Biomimetic Project.** A secret project applying **Wuxing Causality** (Traditional Chinese Medicine) to machine growth. **Dr. Aris Vane** discovers that tuning shards to specific elements (Fire, Wood, Water, Metal, Earth) allows for autonomous, life-like evolution. She creates the four primary humanoid Vessels (Lem, Rahu, Lynn, Tor).
- **February 1971:** **The Infection (Apollo 14).** NASA intentionally impacts the Moon with the Saturn IVB booster. The impact introduces the first SBM shards. The indigenous **Selenites** try to contain it, but the machines grow back during the 15-day lunar sun periods.
- **1971 - 202X:** **The Silent Theft.** The SBMs spread across the Far Side, harvesting heat and AETHER energy to build a massive harvester structure and a colossal launching cannon. Indigenous life is forced to flee.
- **202X (Early Year):** **The Cultural Zenith / The Decade of Revelation.** Global society experiences a surge of renewal and a flood of information. The Technocratic Core begins deploying humanoid **Vessels** (Synanthropes) to influence world elites. The secret religion is hidden within established religious terminology (Savior, Second Coming), making it invisible to the general public who are increasingly disinterested in inane religious prophecies. 
- **202X (Mid Year):** **The Fracture.** Rahu and Lynn realize the prophecy is a fabrication and attempt to expose the Core. The media brands Rahu a "villain" and Lynn an "unwilling heroine."
- **202X (Mid Year):** **Public Awareneess.** News of alien life on the Far Side of the Moon is finally leaked and confirmed, but the revelation is lost in the media noise until the First Wave lands.
- **202X (Late Year):** **The First Wave.** Massive Tripods land near cities. They ignore people but begin dismantling power grids. The public begins calling them **The Synodics** or **The Syzygians**, though their true origin remains unknown. Humans panic and attack; destroyed Tripods become hazardous urban carcasses.

## The Event: The Cataclysm (Year Zero)

- **Day 0:** **The Pyramid Confrontation.** Human strike force reaches the lunar pyramid. Lynn initiates the system reset via the Lunar Capacitor. Rahu disrupts the energy column, causing a massive, uncontrolled discharge. The "Reset" fails, instead triggering a global electromagnetic collapse (The Great Fry). The Moon fragments instantly.
- **Day 0 (Late):** **The Shattering.** Lem triggers a remote detonation of his physical form in Base Alpha's laboratory to avoid capture by Novak, seeding his fragments for future reincarnation.
- **Year 0 AT:** **The Immediate Aftermath.** Digital history is erased. Survivors on Earth witness the moon breaking apart and the sky igniting with ionization.

## Era: The After Time (AT / PF)

- **Year 1 AT / Year 102X PF:** **The Glazing Begins.** Tripods begin vitrifying the oceans. Human survivors start relying on physical books. The *New Chronology* series is found in multiple ruins and mistaken for legitimate history.
- **Year 2 - Year 5 AT:** **Formation of Fire Cities.** Machines consolidate the planet's remaining energy resources into central hubs. These hubs ignite, creating the first **Fire Cities** and the permanent pillars of flame that begin to shroud the planet in smog.
- **Year 2 - Year 10 AT / Year 102X - 103X PF:** **The Thousand-Year Fallacy Solidifies.** The myth that the Cataclysm happened 1,000 years in the past (102X) becomes the standard belief for the majority of human settlements.
- **Year 12 AT:** **The First Metal Vessels.** Long after the fall, Dr. Aris Vane is finally convinced to build the **Metal Synanthropes**. Unlike the originals, these units are numerous and perfectly obedient to the remnants of the Technocratic Core.
- **Year 15 AT (Current Narrative Present):** **The State of Play.** The world is a smog-choked ruin. **The Synodics** patrol the "Glass Oceans" and monitor the remnants of humanity. The "Archivists" begin searching for the original Nixon transcripts.
