# The Thousand-Year Fallacy: Official Core Narrative

The Thousand-Year Fallacy is the official historical record maintained by the Core. It is designed to ensure psychological stability and ideological compliance among the human populations of the **Archipelago** and the terrestrial mega-cities.

## The Theory of Iterative History (The Duplicate Strike)
The Core teaches that history is cyclical and iterative. Rather than a linear progression, humanity is subject to recurring cycles of "Alien Arrival" and "Sanitization."
- **The First Arrival (Year 0):** The Core claims the primary alien occupation began exactly one millennium ago. This represents the start of the **Abyssal Millennium**, a period of total alien dominance.
- **The Duplicate Strike (Year 1000 / 0 AT):** The events of 15 years ago (the actual 2026 cataclysm) are framed as the "Duplicate Strike"—a recurring cataclysm triggered by the aliens when humanity attempts to resist their control.

## Validating Human Memory: The "Failed Bloom"
To account for citizens who remember the 21st century (the actual Before Time), the Core utilizes the **Failed Bloom** narrative.
- **The False Renaissance (Year 990–1000):** Memories of modern cities, advanced technology, and global networks are validated as real memories of a brief "human bloom" that occurred just before the Duplicate Strike.
- **The Alien Trap:** The Core teaches that this bloom was an intentional "honey-trap" by the aliens (Kira) to gather humanity into centralized hubs for easier sanitization. 
- **The Prophet's Arrival:** The appearance of **Rahu** during this time is described as the fulfillment of the "Millennium Trajectory" (the Prophecy), signaling the start of the final human Resistance.

## Historical Harmonization
To maintains the integrity of this timeline, the Core employs **Historical Harmonizers**.
- **The Role:** Harmonizers are high-ranking officials responsible for "smoothing over" artifacts, records, or survivor testimonies that conflict with the official duplicate timeline.
- **Protocol: The Apathy Initiative:** A strategic campaign of psychological warfare. The Core frames village religious leaders as "Kira Cultists" and "Witchcraft Extremists" to turn the population against them. By targeting these figures for "Harmonization" (targeted erasure), the Core ensures that the common villager becomes "burned out"—too fearful of the consequences to preserve the unedited oral history.
- **The Scrubbing of the Third Man:** All official Core footage of the Moon Cataclysm and the battle with "Witch Kira" has been digitally edited to remove the presence of **Lem**. By erasing the human witness from history, the Core ensures that any survivor's memory of a "third party" is dismissed as a hallucination or the "Digital Taint."
- **Cassia Vane:** As a lead Harmonizer, Cassia was chosen for her extreme persuasive influence and ability to reshape perspectives. She ensures that "contradictory" data is harmonized into the state narrative without the need for force.

## Cultural Rituals of the Fallacy
### The Decontamination Ceremony (The Clearing of the Hearth)
An annual ritual practiced by Core citizens to physically and spiritually remove the "taint" of the old world.
- **The Communal Pyre:** Citizens gather to burn found 202X technology (digital relics). 
- **Symbolism:** The fire represents the purging of ego, arrogance, and the negative character traits that supposedly led to the "Failed Bloom."
- **Saint Rahu:** While the Core remains strictly secular in its laws, it permits the cultural worship of Rahu as a "Holy Saint" or "Savior" through these rituals, framing it as a healthy psychological outlet for the population.

## The Digital Taint
The Core enforces a strict policy against all pre-AT technology.
- **Backdoors and Exploits:** All 202X digital technology is claimed to be "poisoned" with alien backdoors established during the millennium occupation.
- **Technological Surrender:** Entering the Archipelago or a mega-city requires a total surrender of all relic technology. 
- **Pure Synodic Infrastructure:** Replacing the tainted past is a new array of "Pure Synodic" technology (operated by **Aether-OS**), which the Core claims is inherently immune to alien hijacking.
