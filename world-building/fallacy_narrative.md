# The Thousand-Year Fallacy: Official Core Narrative

The Thousand-Year Fallacy is the official historical record maintained by the Core. It is designed to ensure psychological stability and ideological compliance among the human populations of the **Archipelago** and the terrestrial mega-cities.

## The Theory of Iterative History (The Duplicate Strike)
The Core teaches that history is cyclical and iterative. Rather than a linear progression, humanity is subject to recurring cycles of "Alien Arrival" and "Sanitization."
- **The First Arrival (Year 0):** The Core claims the primary alien occupation began exactly one millennium ago. This represents the start of the **Abyssal Millennium**, a period of total alien dominance.
- **The Duplicate Strike (Year 1000 / 0 AT):** The events of 15 years ago (the actual 2026 cataclysm) are framed as the "Duplicate Strike"—a recurring cataclysm triggered by the aliens when humanity attempts to resist their control.

## Validating Human Memory: The "Failed Bloom"
To account for citizens who remember the 21st century (the actual Before Time), the Core utilizes the **Failed Bloom** narrative.
- **The False Lemaissance (Year 990–1000):** Memories of modern cities, advanced technology, and global networks are validated as real memories of a brief "human bloom" that occurred just before the Duplicate Strike.
- **The Alien Trap:** The Core teaches that this bloom was an intentional "honey-trap" by the aliens (Maya) to gather humanity into centralized hubs for easier sanitization. 
- **The Vessel's Reincarnation:** The appearance of the General and his lieutenants during this time is described as the fulfillment of the "Millennium Trajectory." The Core teaches that these **Vessels** (Rahu and Tor) sacrificed their lives in Year 0 to destroy the alien **Lunar Capacitor**, only to be reincarnated a thousand years later to led the final human Resistance against the returned Witch Maya.

## Historical Harmonization
To maintains the integrity of this timeline, the Core employs **Historical Harmonizers**.
- **The Role:** Harmonizers are high-ranking officials responsible for "smoothing over" artifacts, records, or survivor testimonies that conflict with the official duplicate timeline.
- **Protocol: The Apathy Initiative:** A strategic campaign of psychological warfare. The Core frames village religious leaders as "Maya Cultists" and "Witchcraft Extremists" to turn the population against them. By targeting these figures for "Harmonization" (targeted erasure), the Core ensures that the common villager becomes "burned out"—too fearful of the consequences to preserve the unedited oral history.
- **The Scrubbing of the Third Man:** All official Core footage of the Moon Cataclysm and the battle with "Witch Maya" has been digitally edited to remove the presence of **Lem**. By erasing the human witness from history, the Core ensures that any survivor's memory of a "third party" is dismissed as a hallucination or the "Digital Taint."
- **Cassia Vane:** As a lead Harmonizer, Cassia was chosen for her extreme persuasive influence and ability to reshape perspectives. She ensures that "contradictory" data is harmonized into the state narrative without the need for force.

## Cultural Rituals of the Fallacy
### The Maya-Leaf Hunt
A popular family ritual practiced in the mega-cities to reinforce the "Wood-Taint" narrative.
- **The Hunt:** Parents purchase lab-grown maple leaves (since trees do not grow in the desert cities) and hide them throughout the home. 
- **The Burn:** Children hunt for these "Maya fragments" and incinerate them in small communal or domestic burners. 
- **Symbolism:** The game teaches that life outside the Core's control (represented by the leaves) is inherently dangerous and must be destroyed. Children are rewarded with digital tokens or "clean" treats for their success.

### The Lunar Lament
A monthly ritual celebrated by the **Lamenters** (approx. 15% of the population).
- **The Candlelit Vigil:** On the nights when the moon would have been on its full cycle, the power is symbolically cut in residential blocks. Citizens use candles and natural light sources to mourn the moon's destruction in Year 0.
- **The Vessel Myth:** While most citizens (85%) view the Vessels as high-tech military machines, Lamenters believe they are holy spirits reincarnated to save humanity twice. The Core permits this spiritual outlet as it reinforces the legitimacy of the military leadership.
- **Instrument of Salvation:** During Lament services, the legend of Rahu's sword is retold—how it deflected Maya's electric storm in Year 0 and again in Year 1000, saving the Earth from total sterilization.

## The Digital Taint
The Core enforces a strict policy against all pre-AT technology.
- **Backdoors and Exploits:** All 202X digital technology is claimed to be "poisoned" with alien backdoors established during the millennium occupation.
- **Technological Surrender:** Entering the Archipelago or a mega-city requires a total surrender of all relic technology. 
- **Pure Synodic Infrastructure:** Replacing the tainted past is a new array of "Pure Synodic" technology (operated by **Aether-OS**), which the Core claims is inherently immune to alien hijacking.

## The Wuxan Counter-Narrative: The Apex Autocracy
While the Core teaches Iterative History, the **Wuxan** Prophet Arlo offers a different analysis based on the oral traditions of the **Tamazight Long Count**.
- **The Technocratic Trap:** Arlo identifies the "Apex Autocracy" as a recurring historical system of control. He argues that the Technocracy has appeared throughout history under various masks—God, Aliens, or the "Wizard of Oz"—to justify total centralization of power.
- **The Secret Priest Class:** The Wuxan believe that power is always wielded by a hidden Core and a secret priest class. These handlers operate from concealed locations and design the very militaries and systems that the population is engineered to depend upon.
- **Continual Reemergence:** According to this view, the defeat of a specific political mask (like a fallen empire or a defeated "alien" invasion) is irrelevant. The "Technocratic Core" remains concealed, ensuring its inevitable reemergence through the systems designed to trap humanity.
- **The Mundane Motive:** Arlo points to archaic fragments like "and now I just need your credit card number" as evidence that despite its grand "miracles," the Core's ultimate goal is always a simple, mundane transaction of total control.
