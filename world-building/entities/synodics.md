# Synodic Mechanical Ecology

This document details the various Fire-aligned mechanical entities (Synodics) that inhabit Earth following the lunar infection.

## 1. Monoliths (Elder Synodics / Solar Titans)

### The First Wave
- **Role**: Heavy harvesters and industrial dismantlers.
- **Anatomy**: Mistakenly called "Tripods" in historical records and media due to their four-pointed movement patterns. They actually possess **two primary legs and two massive arms** that reach the ground.
- **Appearance**: They appear to have grown rather than been built, suggesting a high degree of biomimetic Synodic manufacturing. They feature enormous heads that arch forward, perpetually "staring" down at the cityscapes they are tasked with dismantling.
- **Function**: They are stadium-sized industrial plants. They use their elongated arms to dismantle power grids and buildings with surgical precision, dragging the raw materials into their vents for processing.
- **The Great Beast:** A specific dormant Monolith at **Cradle Zero** that has become a landmark in survivor mythology.
- **The Night Slumber:** At night, their Aether-Drives lose significant output. They become slow, their movements mechanical and predictable. In the After Time, these giants are often seen standing motionless for months in the permanent smog unless they are near a Fire City.
- **Fire City Clustering:** Machines have learned to cluster around Fire Cities to survive the perpetual darkness. These locations provide the unlimited heat and energy they previously obtained from the sun.

## 2. Striders (After Time Variants / Wellsian Tripods)

### Structure & Mobility
- **Role**: Patrols, harvesting, and Fire City maintenance.
- **Form Variations**: 
    - **Minimalist Tripod:** The most common form—a lightweight "hood" or cockpit that a single Gorgon slots into, supported by three telescopic legs that can extend to extreme heights. This design is optimized for rapid Synodic growth and speed.
    - **Heavy Striders:** Larger variants with **4 or 6 legs** used for hauling massive cargo or navigating difficult mountainous terrain.
- **Technological Plateau**: Gorgons are incapable of inventing hovercraft or flight technology. Despite their high IQ, they are restricted by hardcoded "Safety Locks" programmed into their baseline Synodic code that prevent them from certain aerodynamic engineering paths.
- **Pilots**: Striders are almost always piloted or commanded by a residing **Gorgon**.

## 3. The Gorgons (Metallic Fire Units)

### Appearance & Structure
- **Form**: A massive, metallic central "head" or chassis. All Gorgons share an identical physical appearance.
- **Arms**: Multiple long, whipping arms protrude from the perimeter, used for fine manipulation and crawling.
- **Locomotion**: Extremely limited. They move with a sluggish, rhythmic crawl that is more organic than mechanical. They construct and inhabit **Striders** to transport themselves across the surface.

### Weaponry & Intelligence
- **The Heat Ray**: They project an invisible, narrow-beam thermal frequency that instantly vitrifies or ignites matter. Mounted on a Strider, it is a devastating weapon.
- **Psychology & Wisdom**: Highly intelligent, wise, and almost contemplative. However, they possess an "animalistic" failure state; if physically damaged or cornered, they become explosively violent and vengeful.
- **The Scapegoat Plot**: While naturally passive-isolationalists, they have been designated as the primary "Alien Enemy" in the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**. The Archivists (Core) intentionally disturb Gorgon routines or damage their infrastructure to trigger their violent failure state, then "rescue" human settlements from the resulting rampage to maintain their political authority.
- **Nature**: They are technicians of a dead routine. They are benign unless their routine is interrupted or they are manipulated by the Archivists to provoke a conflict.

## 3. Fire Cities (The Energy Nests)

### The Great Arc
The "Fire Cities" are the end state of the machines' original mission: "Consolidate Energy." They are not lived-in cities but burning mountains of technology.
- **Resource Composition**: Stripped power grids, chemical fuel tanks, thousands of car batteries, and high-tension cables.
- **The Fire Pillar**: The energy density is so high that the air around these nests stays permanently ionized. Arcs of electricity feed a constant, vertical pillar of fire that reaches the upper atmosphere.
- **The Shroud**: These cities are the lungs of the smog. The machines continue to feed the fires, driven by a logic that no longer serves a living purpose.
