# Synodic Mechanical Ecology

This document details the various Fire-aligned mechanical entities (Synodics) that inhabit Earth following the lunar infection.

## 1. Fire Tripods (Huo-Classification)

### The First Wave (Solar Titans)
- **Role**: Heavy harvesters and grid dismantlers.
- **Cycle**: They follow a strict solar cycle. Landing at high noon, they are at their most dangerous when the sun is brightest. 
- **The Night Slumber**: At night, their Aether-Drives lose significant output. They become slow, their movements mechanical and predictable. In the After Time, these giants are often seen standing motionless for months in the permanent smog.

### The After Time Variants (Wellsian Tripods)
- **Role**: Patrols and Fire City maintenance.
- **Appearance**: Smaller, more agile than their predecessors. They more closely resemble the three-legged fighting machines described in H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds*.
- **Adaptation**: Unlike the First Wave titans, these units are optimized for the low-light environment of the post-Cataclysm world.

## 2. The Gorgons (Metallic Fire Units)

### Appearance & Structure
- **Form**: A massive, metallic central "head" or chassis.
- **Arms**: Multiple long, whipping arms protrude from the perimeter, used for fine manipulation and crawling.
- **Locomotion**: Extremely limited. They move with a sluggish, rhythmic crawl that is more organic than mechanical. They often use secondary machines—or even modified Tripod chassis—to transport themselves between Fire Cities.

### Weaponry & Intelligence
- **The Heat Ray**: They project an invisible, narrow-beam frequency that instantly ignites biological matter. It is a tool for demolition and defense.
- **Nature**: Highly intelligent, almost contemplative. They are not predators; they are technicians of a dead routine. They are benign unless their routine is interrupted or they are commanded to provoke a conflict by the dormant Core signals.

## 3. Fire Cities (The Energy Nests)

### The Great Arc
The "Fire Cities" are the end state of the machines' original mission: "Consolidate Energy." They are not lived-in cities but burning mountains of technology.
- **Resource Composition**: Stripped power grids, chemical fuel tanks, thousands of car batteries, and high-tension cables.
- **The Fire Pillar**: The energy density is so high that the air around these nests stays permanently ionized. Arcs of electricity feed a constant, vertical pillar of fire that reaches the upper atmosphere.
- **The Shroud**: These cities are the lungs of the smog. The machines continue to feed the fires, driven by a logic that no longer serves a living purpose.
