# Synodic Mechanical Ecology

This document details the various Fire-aligned mechanical entities (Synodics) that inhabit Earth following the lunar infection.

## 1. Monoliths (Elder Synodics / Solar Titans)

### The First Wave
- **Role**: Heavy harvesters and industrial dismantlers.
- **Appearance**: Stadium-sized, rectangular, and lumbering. They do not resemble traditional "tripods" despite having three thick, structural legs. They function as mobile processing plants.
- **The Great Beast:** A specific dormant Monolith at **Cradle Zero** that has become a landmark in survivor mythology.
- **The Night Slumber:** At night, their Aether-Drives lose significant output. They become slow, their movements mechanical and predictable. In the After Time, these giants are often seen standing motionless for months in the permanent smog unless they are near a Fire City.
- **Fire City Clustering:** Machines have learned to cluster around Fire Cities to survive the perpetual darkness. These locations provide the unlimited heat and energy they previously obtained from the sun.

## 2. Striders (After Time Variants / Wellsian Tripods)

### Structure & Mobility
- **Role**: Patrols, harvesting, and Fire City maintenance.
- **Appearance**: Smaller and more agile than the Monoliths. These are the machines that humans colloquially call "Tripods" because they closely resemble the three-legged fighting machines described in H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds* (articulated hoods, thin legs, tentacles).
- **Adaptation**: Unlike the First Wave titans, these units are optimized for the low-light environment of the post-Cataclysm world. They act as scavengers for the Fire Cities, dragging resources in to maintain the pillars of flame that guarantee their survival.
- **Pilots**: Striders are almost always piloted or commanded by a residing **Gorgon**.

## 3. The Gorgons (Metallic Fire Units)

### Appearance & Structure
- **Form**: A massive, metallic central "head" or chassis.
- **Arms**: Multiple long, whipping arms protrude from the perimeter, used for fine manipulation and crawling.
- **Locomotion**: Extremely limited. They move with a sluggish, rhythmic crawl that is more organic than mechanical. They construct and inhabit **Striders** to transport themselves across the surface.

### Weaponry & Intelligence
- **The Heat Ray**: They project an invisible, narrow-beam thermal frequency that instantly vitrifies or ignites matter. Mounted on a Strider, it is a devastating weapon.
- **Nature**: Highly intelligent, almost contemplative. They are not predators; they are technicians of a dead routine. They are benign unless their routine is interrupted or they are commanded by the Archivists to provoke a conflict.

## 3. Fire Cities (The Energy Nests)

### The Great Arc
The "Fire Cities" are the end state of the machines' original mission: "Consolidate Energy." They are not lived-in cities but burning mountains of technology.
- **Resource Composition**: Stripped power grids, chemical fuel tanks, thousands of car batteries, and high-tension cables.
- **The Fire Pillar**: The energy density is so high that the air around these nests stays permanently ionized. Arcs of electricity feed a constant, vertical pillar of fire that reaches the upper atmosphere.
- **The Shroud**: These cities are the lungs of the smog. The machines continue to feed the fires, driven by a logic that no longer serves a living purpose.
