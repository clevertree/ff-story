---

## Physical Description
- **Age:** 28 (as of Year 15 AT)
- **Appearance:** Cassia possesses a focused and analytical gaze, often masked by the soft, melodic glow of her **Thinking-Link** headset. She typically wears the clinical, high-contrast uniform of the Archivist technical elite. Her appearance is designed to be soothing and non-threatening, a key part of her "Harmonizer" persona.
- **Key Features:** A specialized "Harmonic" headset that she rarely removes, which hums with a faint Aetheric pulse.

## Background & Origin
- **The Vane Dynasty:** Cassia is a member of the Vane family, a distant relative (great-grandniece) of **Dr. Elowen Vane**. She was born shortly before the Moon Cataclysm (The Great Fry).
- **Academic Indoctrination:** Cassia grew up entirely within the framework of the Core's rise to power. She was taught that Elowen Vane was a legendary figure who died long ago, never realizing that the "machine voice" guiding her research was her own ancestor.
- **The Harmonizer Role:** She was selected for the specialized role of Harmonizer due to her natural affinity for Aetheric frequencies—an ability she uses to "sing" command codes into the Synodic field to pacify wild units or stabilize Vessel spirits.

## Personality & Psychology
- **Analytical Compassion:** Cassia displays a practicing, almost clinical compassion. She genuinely cares for the mental stability of the Vessels, but she views their suffering as a technical problem to be solved rather than a moral horror.
- **Curiosity over Morality:** She is deeply fascinated by her mother's claims that the Vessels possess a "spirit" or "soul." To Cassia, this is a fascinating design curiosity—a ghost in the machine that makes her job more challenging and rewarding.
- **Personal Stake:** Cassia takes a personal interest in the success of Core missions. She views the Vessels as "her" charges and feels a maternal (if clinical) pride when they perform well.
- **Restricted Dreamer:** Despite her high status, Cassia is restricted to the Core's primary bases for her own "safety." She serves as the voice of authority and calm in the ears of every mission team during briefings, but she longs for a world where the "Optmized Order" is complete so she can finally travel the Earth freely.

## Narrative Role
- **The First Face:** Cassia is the first person **Lem** sees upon his awakening in Year 15 AT ([Chapter 20](../chapters/chapter_20_the_awakening.md)). She is the one tasked with "reformatting" him and preparing him for his new role in the Cradle Zero reclamation.
- **Mission Briefing Voice:** She provides the tactical and psychological framing for every major mission, serving as the calm, guiding presence in the Vessels' Aether-Drives.
- **The Ethical Shadow:** Her character serves to highlight the gap between the Core's "benevolent" self-image and the reality of their control. She is "kind" in the way a programmer is kind to a complex piece of software.

## Skills & Abilities
- **Thinking-Link Mastery:** Expert usage of the Thinking-Link device to project complex harmonic codes.
- **Aetheric Singing:** The ability to modulate her mental broadcast to pacify "wild" tech-life forms (Synodics).
- **Vessel Diagnostics:** Specialized knowledge of Vessel Aether-Drives and memory sanitation protocols.

## Relationships
- **Dr. Elowen Vane (Mother):** Respected but viewed as overly sentimental regarding the "human" nature of the Vessels.
- **Commander Novak (Superior):** A relationship of professional necessity; Cassia manages the assets that Novak deploys.
- **Lem (Subject 01):** Cassia takes an extra interest in Lem because his survival was a mathematical impossibility. She views him as her most important "project."

## Known Contradictions / Internal Conflicts
- **Freedom vs. Order:** Cassia wants a world without restrictions, yet her entire career is dedicated to building a system of total control. She believes the control is the only path to the freedom she craves.
- **The Detonation Confusion:** Cassia is genuinely unaware of the "Remote Detonation" safety protocols installed in the primary Vessels. When questioned by Lem about Rahu's destruction, she truly believes it was a spontaneous malfunction. This ignorance highlights the compartmentalization of information even at the highest levels of the Archivist hierarchy.
