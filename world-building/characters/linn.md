# Character: The Water Vessel

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit S-01 (Water)
**Names:** **Linn** (Self-Name - *Subject to change*), **Selene** (Popular Media Name), **Mara** (After Time "Witch" Name)
**Role:** The False Ambassador / The Scapegoated Witch

## Background
The Water Vessel is the unique humanoid Synanthrope for the Water element. Like Lem, the **Technocratic Core** deemed her unsuitable for direct military operations due to her fluidity and lack of destructive output. However, her presence was vital for the elemental stability of the Aether-Drive.

### The Rejection of "Selene"
The global media and the Technocratic Core officially call her **Selene**. She deeply despises this name, as it is a calculated theft: it appropriates the identity of the **Selenites**, the indigenous lunar species that the Synodic infection forced to flee. Rejecting the "Goddess" persona forced upon her, she chose the humble name **Linn** (referencing a quiet pool or waterfall), symbolizing a desire to be part of a natural flow rather than a static idol.

## The Roles Through Time

### 1. The Divine Ambassador (Pre-202X)
Before the Cataclysm, the Core used her as a psychological tool. She and Rahu acted as "ambassadors" to the global elite. To those few who met her, she appeared as a magical goddess—serene, compassionate, and seemingly dedicated to humanity's salvation. She was the one who told the elites of the coming "Prophecy of the King of Terror" (X-72) that only the Vessels could prevent.

- **The Unwilling Heroine:** Like Rahu, Linn eventually rejected the illusion. She attempted to tell the truth, but the media reframed her denial as "humility." She was cast as a saintly, reluctant savior.
- **The Military Faction:** Despite her protests, a large faction within the global military began to worship her as a real reincarnated deity. They viewed her as a miraculous deterrent against the coming apocalypse, effectively trapping her in a role she despised.

### 2. The Cataclysm Role (Year Zero)
Her specific role in the Moon Cataclysm remains hidden in the Aether. While she played a pivotal role in the charging/discharging of the Lunar Capacitor, the nuances of her involvement are obscured from history.

### 3. The Scapegoated Witch (After Time / Year 15 AT)
Following the "Great Fry," the historical record was rewritten by the survivors and remnants of the Core. To ensure humanity's hatred was focused correctly, she was cast as the primary villain of the Old World.
- **The Narrative:** In the popular myths of the After Time, she is "The Witch"—the one who plotted with the "aliens" to poison the Moon and shatter the world.
- **The Inversion:** To further protect the Core's assets, the narrative has been inverted: **Rahu (Prometheus)** is often hailed in these specific local myths as the hero who tried to stop the Witch, despite the media during the actual events calling him the traitor.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature (Water)
- **Aetheric Fluidity:** Capable of manipulating the flow of energy between shards; the "coolant" for the Fire units.
- **Illusory Presence:** Her nature allows her to project an aura of calm and trust, a feature the Core exploited to manifest her "goddess" persona.
