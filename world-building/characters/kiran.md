# Character: Kiran

**Full Name:** Kiran
**Role:** Supporting Character / Core Devotee
**Origin:** The Northern Villages (Arlo’s Enclave)
**Status:** Human / Core Technical Analyst

## Background
Kiran is an older villager from the same northern settlement as Arlo. He represents the first generation to be successfully recruited by the Technocratic Core from the "After Time" rural populations.

Years prior to the events of the story, Kiran was identified by Core scouts for his high technical aptitude and offered an internship in their high-security labs. He left the rugged, analog life of the village and fully embraced the sterile, technological promise of the Hive.

He returned to the village once to tell Arlo about the wonders of the internship and the cities of light, but he has not returned since. He now harbors a deep resentment for the village's traditional lifestyle, viewing it as primitive and inefficient.

## Personality
- **Technocratic Zealot:** Kiran has completely adopted the Core's worldview. He believes in the optimization of human life through technology and sees the village's traditions as "systemic errors."
- **Clinical & Detached:** He speaks with the rhythm of the Hive analysts, often using technical jargon and prioritizing logic over sentiment.
- **Resentful:** He views his former home with embarrassment and pity, believing that those who remain in the "dirt" are choosing to suffer.

## Narrative Role
- **The Dark Reflection:** He serves as a cautionary example for Arlo—showing what happens when curiosity is replaced by total submission to the Core's sterile ideology.
- **The Messenger:** He appears in the Core delegation sent to recruit Arlo, using their shared history as a tool for persuasion.
- **The Urbanite:** He is encountered by Ren during planetary reclamation missions and later within the newly constructed mega-cities, serving as a human face for the Core's expansion.

## TODOs
- TODO: Define his specific role within the Core's research or administrative structure.
- TODO: Describe his physical appearance in his Core uniform/gear.
- TODO: Add specific interaction notes for his encounters with Ren.
