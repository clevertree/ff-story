---

## Description
- **On-air persona:** Smooth, strangely comforting cadence; a practiced neutrality that leans toward reassurance. He is polished, unflappable, and reads prepared scripts with a human inflection that many find reassuring.
- **Appearance:** Clean-cut, unremarkable; designed to be a face the public accepts without question.

## Background
- **Professional trajectory:** Trained as a broadcast journalist in the Hive academies and hired by Core Central. He never left the studio for long field assignments, becoming the reliable anchor voice for crisis briefings.
- **Independence myth:** Presented as an "independent" voice, Jace's editorial control is limited; producers and archivist algorithms curate his scripts, and he rarely knows the full context behind the lines he reads.

## Personality
- **Generic charm:** Mildly personable, cautious, and quick to mirror the emotional register his producers request. He genuinely believes he's informing and protecting citizens, even as his language gets co-opted as propaganda.
- **Unwitting agent:** He begins to react to irregularities in the feeds—hesitant pauses, unusually worded disclaimers—but interprets them as editorial uncertainty rather than a broader conspiracy.

## Narrative Role
- **Propaganda conduit:** Serves as a recognizable, repeatable voice the Core uses to normalize extreme policy (e.g., "Project Alignment").
- **Emotional barometer:** His subtle tonal shifts serve as a clue to readers that the official line is cracking—he becomes an accidental barometer for the Council's internal struggle.
- **In-studio only:** He is never described as being on the ground; his presence is mediated through screens and feeds that technicians like Jarek monitor.

## Key Traits & Tropes
- **Voice of Comfort:** He frames securitization as benevolence; his diction soothes while the policy does harm.
- **Puppet and Person:** A figure who is both a curated persona and a real person with private doubts he rarely vocalizes.
