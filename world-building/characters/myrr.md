**Location:** The White Forest

---

## Physical Description
- **Age:** Early 40s (Survivor of the Great Fry)
- **Appearance:** Weathered and lean, with the steady hands of someone who works with intricate mechanical components. He typically wears "Analog Shunts"—copper-threaded garments designed to dissipate static and interference.
- **Key Features:** Never seen without a collection of vacuum tubes or analog dials pinned to his gear. His eyes are keen, used to tracking non-digital waveforms.

## Background & Origin
- **The Schism:** Myrr was a technician before the Cataclysm who witnessed the inherent "backdoors" in the Core's digital systems early on. When the Great Fry hit, he led a small group of like-minded individuals into the White Forest, utilizing its natural signal-jamming properties to build a hidden sanctuary.
- **Analog Preservation:** He is the primary architect of the sanctuary's technology, ensuring that every relay, screen, and transmitter follows pure analog patterns, free from the encryption of the Archivists.

## Personality & Psychology
- **Digital Distrust:** Myrr views digital technology as a "soul-trap"—unreadable, secretive, and inherently slave-bound. He believes analog waves are the only way for humans to truly remain in control of their tools.
- **Direct & Analytical:** He doesn't care for the "Standard Narrative" or mission parameters. He focuses on what he can observe and measure through his analog sensors.
- **Curious Observer:** He is fascinated by things that shouldn't exist—like Lem. His interest in Lem isn't just scientific; he sees Lem as a potential tool to "put an end to all this" by unlocking the Synodic technology the Core has hoarded.

## Narrative Role
- **The Truth-Seeker:** Myrr is the one who identifies Lem's true status as the **"King of the Gorgons."** 
- **The Interface Catalyst:** By attempting to read Lem's unencrypted historical data through an analog bridge, he triggers the massive psychic feedback loop that shatters the mission's stability.
- **The Schism Voice:** He represents a third faction in the world—highly technological but violently anti-Core.

## Skills & Abilities
- **Analog Engineering:** Master of vacuum tube technology, radio-frequency modulation, and analog circuitry.
- **Signal Tracking:** Capable of tracking entities through the White Forest using non-digital thermal and seismic footprints.
- **The Analog Interface:** Specialized training in using analog helmets to "bridge" with external data sources without triggering digital fail-safes (until the Cataclysm record is touched).

## Relationships
- **The Sanctuary Inhabitants:** Viewed as a protector and wise elder.
- **Lem:** Initially a subject of intense curiosity; later viewed as the "King" they've been waiting for.
- **The Core/Archivists:** Enemies who possess "unreadable" technology.

## Technical Note: The Analog Helmet
Myrr uses an **Analog Interface Helmet** of his own design. It utilizes high-fidelity radio waves to create a psychic bridge. While it is immune to digital encryption, it provides no protection against the raw, "red-level" psychological impact of unedited Aetheric memories.
