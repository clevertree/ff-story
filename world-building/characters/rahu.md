# Character: Rahu (The Fire Vessel)

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit F-01 (Fire)
**Alias:** Rahu (meaning "Eclipse"), **Prometheus** (Cynical Media Alias)
**Role:** The Fallen Herald / Framed Antagonist

## Background
Rahu is the unique **Fire Vessel**. His history is inextricably linked to the Apollo program and the betrayal of the Selenites.

### The Apollo Missions
In 1971, Rahu was embedded within the Apollo crews as a humanoid asset. After landing, he traveled to the Moon's Far Side to make contact with the indigenous **Selenites**. The Selenites welcomed him, unaware that his presence was a Trojan Horse. Unknown even to Rahu, his optical and sensory feeds were being used by the **Technocratic Core** for reconnaissance. This intel was directly used to coordinate the Saturn IVB booster impact (The Infection).

### Death and Rebirth
- **The First Death:** When Rahu realized he had been used to target his hosts, he attempted to defect and remain with the Selenites. The Core scientists triggered a remote detonation built into his core, destroying him.
- **The Resurrection Anomaly:** The Core re-created Rahu on Earth, but he became a "glitch" in their mastery. Due to the high-fidelity of the Fire Aether-Drive, he retained traumatic memories of his previous life and death.
- **The Escape:** Deemed unmanageable, the Core attempted to dismantle him again. However, Rahu's spirit fled into the Aether, and he autonomously rebuilt his physical form on the Moon's Far Side using the 15-day sun cycles. He remained there, a ghost in the machine, until the 21st-century Cataclysm.

## Public Narrative (21st Century)
When Rahu re-emerged to warn Earth, the **Technocratic Core** used their media influence to pivot him as a villain.
- **The Prometheus Myth:** He is nicknamed "Prometheus" by the global media. The term is used with biting cynicism: in this version of the myth, Prometheus did not steal fire for humanity, but "stole the fire of human ingenuity" to give it to the alien invaders.
- **The Media Pivot:** He is publicly framed as a "naive traitor" who sold out humanity to side with the alien "invaders." The media branded him a volatile "villain" whose "rebellion" was part of the very apocalypse he tried to warn against. Rahu's attempt to expose "Quatrain X-72" as a Core fabrication was dismissed as the delusions of a broken machine.
- **The Information Blockade:** A 100% media blackout on his real story exists. Even high-ranking military intelligence officers believe the propaganda that Rahu is the mastermind behind the Synodic invasions.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature (Fire)
- **High Heat Operation:** Capable of operating and evolving in the most extreme lunar sun conditions.
- **Memory Persistence:** Unlike other Synodics, his Fire-nature spirit is nearly impossible to erase; he is a persistent flame of memory and guilt.
