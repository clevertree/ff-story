# Character: Rahu (The Fire Vessel)

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit F-01 (Fire)
**Alias:** Rahu (meaning "Eclipse"), **Prometheus** (Cynical Media Alias)
**Role:** The Fallen Herald / Framed Antagonist

## Background
Rahu is the unique **Fire Vessel**. His history is inextricably linked to the Apollo program and the betrayal of the Selenites.

### The Apollo Missions
In 1971, Rahu was embedded within the Apollo crews as a humanoid asset. After landing, he traveled to the Moon's Far Side to make contact with the indigenous **Selenites**. The Selenites welcomed him, unaware that his presence was a Trojan Horse. Unknown even to Rahu, his optical and sensory feeds were being used by the **Technocratic Core** for reconnaissance. This intel was directly used to coordinate the Saturn IVB booster impact (The Infection).

### Attempted Detonation & Exile
- **The Betrayal:** When Rahu realized he had been used to target the Selenites, he attempted to defect and warn his hosts. The Core triggered a remote detonation built into his chassis, severely damaging— but not destroying—him. His Fire Aether-Drive refused to extinguish, keeping him in physical form.
- **The Exile:** Deemed unmanageable, the Core exiled Rahu to the Moon's Far Side where their command signals could not reach him. He remained there in a repaired body, haunted by traumatic memories and kept under surveillance through long-distance observation.
- **The Hidden Rebellion:** From exile he repeatedly transmitted warnings about the falsified prophecy and the Core's intentions. Each broadcast that reached Earth during the Decade of Revelation was immediately twisted by Core-aligned media into a treason narrative, cementing his "Prometheus" infamy.

## Public Narrative (21st Century)
When Rahu re-emerged to warn Earth, the **Technocratic Core** used their media influence to pivot him as a villain.
- **The Prometheus Myth:** He is nicknamed "Prometheus" by the global media. The term is used with biting cynicism: in this version of the myth, Prometheus did not steal fire for humanity, but "stole the fire of human ingenuity" to give it to the alien invaders.
- **The Media Pivot:** He is publicly framed as a "naive traitor" who sold out humanity to side with the alien "invaders." The media branded him a volatile "villain" whose "rebellion" was part of the very apocalypse he tried to warn against. Rahu's attempt to expose "Quatrain X-72" as a Core fabrication was dismissed as the delusions of a broken machine.
- **The Information Blockade:** A 100% media blackout on his real story exists. Even high-ranking military intelligence officers believe the propaganda that Rahu is the mastermind behind the Synodic invasions.

## Relationships

### Lynn (The Water Vessel)
Rahu and Lynn are the two primary humanoid Vessels with a shared history predating the Apollo-era deception. They were originally meant to be counterparts, with her Water nature balancing his Fire.
- **The Betrayal of the Core:** Rahu's deepest resentment is reserved for Lynn's apparent compliance with the Core Technocracy. During the confrontation in the pyramid (Chapter 13), his fury is born from seeing her embedded in a human military uniform, serving the same organization that used and discarded him.
- **Mutual Recognition:** Despite the Core's psychological manipulation, Rahu recognizes Lynn's essence instantly. He views her not as a stranger, but as a traitor to their kind who has chosen systematic reset over individual autonomy.

## Narrative Significance (The Cataclysm)
During the confrontation in the lunar pyramid (Chapter 13), Rahu chooses a path of total disruption over Lynn's planned system reset. In Chapter 14, he plunges into the energy column, short-circuiting the Lunar Capacitor. This act transforms the intended biological reset into the "Great Fry"—a global electromagnetic collapse that erases digital civilization. 

### After Time Role (Year 15 AT+)
Following the event, the Technocratic Core reacquired the stasis-bound Rahu. Once the Core re-established their manufacturing capabilities, they rebuilt his physical form and performed a deep memory reset. 

- **The False Hero:** Rahu has been integrated into the **Thousand-Year Fallacy** as the savior of humanity. The Archivists teach that "General Rahu" was the one who personally stopped the "Evil Witch Mara" from detonating the planet.
- **The Utopian Convert:** Re-baptized into the "Archivist" faith, Rahu has become a fervent believer in the Core’s new narrative. He views his past "traitorous" self as a tragic glitch, a "Prometheus" who failed because he lacked the order and love only the Core can provide. He now speaks of the Core as a "loving syndicate" whose only goal is to pull humanity from the ashes.
- **The Cleansing Flame:** He views the reclamation of Earth as a sacred duty. His mission to penetrate the "Fire City" (**Cradle Zero**) is not just tactical; in his mind, he is "extinguishing the madness" of his own previous act (the Great Fry) to replace it with the cool, calculated perfection of the Archivist order.
- **Erasure:** Like Tor, he believes that the "primitive" cultures of the After Time survivors are an anchor to a failed past. He advocates for their absorption into the Archivist "high-tech cities of no pain."
- **The Vanguard:** He leads missions alongside General Tor and an army of the new Metal Vessels, his Fire-nature making him the only asset capable of surviving the base's extreme thermal environment.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature (Fire)
- **High Heat Operation:** Capable of operating and evolving in the most extreme lunar sun conditions.
- **Memory Persistence:** Unlike other Synodics, his Fire-nature spirit is nearly impossible to erase; he is a persistent flame of memory and guilt.
