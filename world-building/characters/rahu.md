# Character: Rahu (The Fire Vessel)

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit F-01 (Fire)
**Alias:** Rahu (meaning "Eclipse"), **Prometheus** (Cynical Media Alias)
**Role:** The Fallen Herald / Framed Antagonist

## Background
Rahu is the unique **Fire Vessel**. His history is inextricably linked to the Apollo program and the secret 1971 infection of the Moon.

### The Apollo Missions
In 1971, Rahu was embedded within the Apollo crews as a humanoid asset. He believed himself to be Earth's first official ambassador to the stars—a chosen representative of a "friendly Earth" sent to establish a research outpost. Unknown even to Rahu, his "mission" was a cover; his optical and sensory feeds were being used by the **Technocratic Core** to monitor the removal of the indigenous **Selenites** and identify a pristine site for the Synodic infection. This intel was directly used to coordinate the Saturn IVB booster impact, which delivered Dr. Vane's SBM shards to the lunar surface.

### The 1971 Cover-Up
When Rahu defected from the mission and failed to return, the Core realized their primary asset was out of control. To prevent the public and global scientific community from realizing a non-human entity was missing on the Moon, the Core refilmed the mission landing and surface operations without him for public release. 

### Elite Indoctrination
While the public never knew he existed, the global elite were told that Rahu had encountered "alien" Synodic machines on the Moon that destroyed him. Only the Core's inner circle kept the true record of his defection.

### Aging & Biology
Unlike the other Vessels who remained under Core maintenance, Rahu learned to bypass his growth-coding after his defection. He froze his biological aging during the 1970s, remaining in a prime physical form for over fifty years of lunar exile.

### Detonation, Exile & Rebirth
- **The Betrayal:** When Rahu realized he had been used to seed the Moon with industrial shards, his identity as an "ambassador" shattered. He turned on the Core, attempting to sabotage the growth of the lunar base. 
- **The Remote Detonation:** The Core triggered a "remote detonation" protocol to eliminate him. Believing him destroyed, they attempted to manufacture a new Fire Vessel. They had previously failed to copy his consciousness while he was online, and they hoped his physical "death" would allow a stable copy to take hold.
- **The Memory Ghost:** To the Core's dismay, the second Fire Vessel iteration retained Rahu's memories and his rage at their betrayal. At the time, they did not understand that the Vessels were truly *alive* (a fact only Dr. Elowen Vane understood), nor did they grasp how the **Aether-Drive** anchored a persistent spirit. Fearing a recursive failure, they abandoned the replication project.
- **Independence:** Somehow, Rahu's spirit survived. He unexpectedly reformed on the Moon's Far Side, utilizing the extreme thermal energy of the 15-day lunar daytime to "reincarnate" from his own scorched remains.
- **The Exile:** Since they could not kill or control him, the Core mitigate the threat through isolation. He remained on the Far Side where command signals could not easily reach him, becoming their greatest secret and most volatile enemy.
- **The Hidden Rebellion:** From exile he repeatedly transmitted warnings about the falsified prophecy and the Core's intentions. Each broadcast that reached Earth during the Decade of Revelation was immediately twisted by Core-aligned media into a treason narrative, cementing his "Prometheus" infamy.

## Public Narrative (21st Century)
As the "Moon Ghost" rumors grew impossible to ignore in 202X, the **Technocratic Core** pivoted the narrative.
- **The Human Traitor:** He is publicly framed not as a machine, but as a "normal human" astronaut/traitor who sold out humanity to side with the alien "invaders." Any special powers he demonstrated were dismissed by the media as "alien gifts" granted to a collaborator. 
- **The Prometheus Myth:** He is nicknamed "Prometheus" by the global media. The term is used with biting cynicism: in this version of the myth, Prometheus did not steal fire for humanity, but "stole the fire of human ingenuity" to give it to the alien invaders.
- **The Information Blockade:** A 100% media blackout on his real story exists. Even high-ranking military intelligence officers believe the propaganda that Rahu is the mastermind behind the Synodic invasions.

## Relationships

### Lynn (The Water Vessel)
Rahu and Lynn are the two primary humanoid Vessels with a shared history predating the Apollo-era deception. They were originally meant to be counterparts, with her Water nature balancing his Fire.
- **Kira vs. Kira:** Rahu is aware that the Archivists refer to the fallen Water Vessel as "The Evil Witch Kira." However, he recognizes her original spiritual signature as **Kira**, the counterpart he knew before the deception.
- **The Betrayal of the Core:** Rahu's deepest resentment is reserved for Lynn's apparent compliance with the Core Technocracy. During the confrontation in the pyramid (Chapter 15), his fury is born from seeing her embedded in a human military uniform, serving the same organization that used and discarded him.
- **Mutual Recognition:** Despite the Core's psychological manipulation, Rahu recognizes Lynn's essence instantly. He views her not as a stranger, but as a traitor to their kind who has chosen systematic reset over individual autonomy.

## Narrative Significance (The Cataclysm)
During the confrontation in the lunar pyramid (Chapter 15), Rahu chooses a path of total disruption over Lynn's planned system reset. In Chapter 16, he plunges into the energy column, short-circuiting the Lunar Capacitor. This act transforms the intended biological reset into the "Great Fry"—a global electromagnetic collapse that erases digital civilization. 

### After Time Role (Year 15 AT+)
Following the event, the Technocratic Core reacquired the stasis-bound Rahu. Once the Core re-established their manufacturing capabilities, they rebuilt his physical form and performed a deep memory reset. 

- **The False Hero:** Rahu has been integrated into the **Thousand-Year Fallacy** as the savior of humanity. The Archivists teach that "General Rahu" was the one who personally stopped the "Evil Witch Kira" from detonating the planet.
- **The Sword of the Moon:** Central to the propaganda is the "Sword of the Moon," a mythic weapon Rahu supposedly used to cleave through Kira's heart. Replicas are displayed in museums, and the Core claims he still wields the original to this day as Earth's ultimate defender. In reality, Rahu used no such weapon; the "sword" is a physical anchor for the masses to visualize his victory.
- **The Utopian Convert:** Re-baptized into the "Archivist" faith, Rahu has become a fervent believer in the Core’s new narrative. He views his past "traitorous" self as a tragic glitch, a "Prometheus" who failed because he lacked the order and love only the Core can provide. He now speaks of the Core as a "loving syndicate" whose only goal is to pull humanity from the ashes.
- **The Cleansing Flame:** He views the reclamation of Earth as a sacred duty. His mission to penetrate the "Fire City" (**Cradle Zero**) is not just tactical; in his mind, he is "extinguishing the madness" of his own previous act (the Great Fry) to replace it with the cool, calculated perfection of the Archivist order.
- **The Memory Clash:** During the Extinguish phase, Rahu's clinical efficiency is shattered when he encounters the Wood Vessel (Lem) unexpectedly manifesting at Cradle Zero. Probing the unit, he discovers a raw copy of the Moon Cataclysm—the "202X Truth"—which contradicts the Archivists' Thousand-Year Fallacy. This forbidden data triggers a mental breakdown as Rahu struggles to reconcile his programmed loyalty with the physical evidence of the Core's deception.
- **Core-Triggered Destruction:** To prevent this "Dangerous Misinformation" from spreading or causing a defection, Core operatives immediately trigger Rahu's remote self-destruction protocol. He is incinerated by his own elemental Fire, and his consciousness is reset once more to erase the event.
- **Redeployment Delay:** Due to the risk of "data residue" from the Moon Cataclysm data he encountered in Lem, Rahu is withheld from service during Lem's second mission (Aggressive Expansion). While standard Vessel recreation takes only a matter of hours, the Core spent the duration of that second mission performing a deep, slow-burn memory sanitization on Rahu to erase the psychological breakdown he suffered after the Extinguish phase.
- **Strategic Deployment:** Despite his instability, the Core views Rahu as a more effective and reliable field asset than General Tor, whose "shaking" on the Moon left him psychologically compromised. Rahu's Fire-nature makes him exceptionally lethal and efficient, provided he is closely monitored.
- **Containment & Monitoring:** To prevent a recursive failure, the Core has implemented several layer-locks:
    - **Isolation Protocol:** Rahu and Lem are strictly forbidden from meeting or being deployed in the same theater.
    - **Enhanced Subroutines:** Extra monitoring subroutines have been embedded in his internal code to alert the Core to any deviation from Archivist truth.
    - **Remote Detonation Readiness:** Like all Vessels, he can be instantly terminated if he begins to reconcile the Archivist Fallacy with observable reality.
- **Return to Service:** He is eventually deemed stable and redeployed for Lem's third mission (Northern Shield). He returns as a cold, clinical enforcer, his previously "defective" curiosity completely suppressed by the Archivist's latest cognitive mapping. 
- **Erasure:** Like Tor, he believes that the "primitive" cultures of the After Time survivors are an anchor to a failed past. He advocates for their absorption into the Archivist "high-tech cities of no pain."
- **The Vanguard:** He leads missions alongside General Tor and an army of the new Metal Vessels, his Fire-nature making him the only asset capable of surviving the base's extreme thermal environment.

- **The Nihilistic Reset (The Final Reincarnation):** Following his neutraliztion at Cradle Zero by Kira, Rahu is reincarnated one final time for the Core's "Absolute Protocol."
    - **Programming of Failure:** To ensure his cooperation in a plan that would destroy the world, the Core programs him with a curated, partial record of all the defeats the Core and the Vessels have suffered. This framing is designed to make him believe that humanity is a lost cause and that the constant cycle of war is a glitch in the planetary system.
    - **Lynn's Legacy Twisted:** He is convinced that by initiating a solar system reset, he is fulfilling Lynn's original vision of a pure start. 
    - **Final Defeat:** During the battle in the Lunar Pyramid, Rahu hesitates to destroy Lem. Anton Drexler takes direct control of his lattice, but Rahu is ultimately destroyed by a massive discharge of energy from Lem's spirit-matter field.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature (Fire)
- **High Heat Operation:** Capable of operating and evolving in the most extreme lunar sun conditions.
- **Memory Persistence:** Unlike other Synodics, his Fire-nature spirit is nearly impossible to erase; he is a persistent flame of memory and guilt.
