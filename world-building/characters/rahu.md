# Character: Rahu (The Fire Vessel)

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit F-01 (Fire)
**Alias:** Rahu (meaning "Eclipse"), **Prometheus** (Cynical Media Alias)
**Role:** The Fallen Herald / Framed Antagonist

## Background
Rahu is the unique **Fire Vessel**. His history is inextricably linked to the Apollo program and the betrayal of the Selenites.

### The Apollo Missions
In 1971, Rahu was embedded within the Apollo crews as a humanoid asset. After landing, he traveled to the Moon's Far Side to make contact with the indigenous **Selenites**. The Selenites welcomed him, unaware that his presence was a Trojan Horse. Unknown even to Rahu, his optical and sensory feeds were being used by the **Technocratic Core** for reconnaissance. This intel was directly used to coordinate the Saturn IVB booster impact (The Infection).

### Attempted Detonation & Exile
- **The Betrayal:** When Rahu realized he had been used to target the Selenites, he attempted to defect and warn his hosts. The Core triggered a remote detonation built into his chassis, severely damaging— but not destroying—him. His Fire Aether-Drive refused to extinguish, keeping him in physical form.
- **The Exile:** Deemed unmanageable, the Core exiled Rahu to the Moon's Far Side where their command signals could not reach him. He remained there in a repaired body, haunted by traumatic memories and kept under surveillance through long-distance observation.
- **The Hidden Rebellion:** From exile he repeatedly transmitted warnings about the falsified prophecy and the Core's intentions. Each broadcast that reached Earth during the Decade of Revelation was immediately twisted by Core-aligned media into a treason narrative, cementing his "Prometheus" infamy.

## Public Narrative (21st Century)
When Rahu re-emerged to warn Earth, the **Technocratic Core** used their media influence to pivot him as a villain.
- **The Prometheus Myth:** He is nicknamed "Prometheus" by the global media. The term is used with biting cynicism: in this version of the myth, Prometheus did not steal fire for humanity, but "stole the fire of human ingenuity" to give it to the alien invaders.
- **The Media Pivot:** He is publicly framed as a "naive traitor" who sold out humanity to side with the alien "invaders." The media branded him a volatile "villain" whose "rebellion" was part of the very apocalypse he tried to warn against. Rahu's attempt to expose "Quatrain X-72" as a Core fabrication was dismissed as the delusions of a broken machine.
- **The Information Blockade:** A 100% media blackout on his real story exists. Even high-ranking military intelligence officers believe the propaganda that Rahu is the mastermind behind the Synodic invasions.

## Relationships

### Lynn (The Water Vessel)
Rahu and Lynn are the two primary humanoid Vessels with a shared history predating the Apollo-era deception. They were originally meant to be counterparts, with her Water nature balancing his Fire.
- **The Betrayal of the Core:** Rahu's deepest resentment is reserved for Lynn's apparent compliance with the Core Technocracy. During the confrontation in the pyramid (Chapter 13), his fury is born from seeing her embedded in a human military uniform, serving the same organization that used and discarded him.
- **Mutual Recognition:** Despite the Core's psychological manipulation, Rahu recognizes Lynn's essence instantly. He views her not as a stranger, but as a traitor to their kind who has chosen systematic reset over individual autonomy.

## Narrative Significance (The Cataclysm)
During the confrontation in the lunar pyramid (Chapter 13), Rahu chooses a path of total disruption over Lynn's planned system reset. In Chapter 14, he plunges into the energy column, short-circuiting the Lunar Capacitor. This act transforms the intended biological reset into the "Great Fry"—a global electromagnetic collapse that erases digital civilization. Rahu's physical form is shattered in the process, though his Fire-spirit remains a fragment in the resulting wreckage, awaiting a different kind of return.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature (Fire)
- **High Heat Operation:** Capable of operating and evolving in the most extreme lunar sun conditions.
- **Memory Persistence:** Unlike other Synodics, his Fire-nature spirit is nearly impossible to erase; he is a persistent flame of memory and guilt.
