---

## Physical Description
- **Age:** Late 20s / Early 30s.
- **Appearance:** Often seen in grease-stained coveralls reinforced with copper mesh. He carries a portable diagnostic kit that uses vacuum-tube indicators rather than digital screens.
- **Key Features:** Nervous eyes that are constantly scanning the horizon for the shimmer of "Project Alignment" or cloaked Gorgons.

## Background & Origin
- **The Technician:** Jarek was born into the northern settlements and trained under Myrr's strict analog protocols. While Myrr focuses on the "philosophy" of the analog, Jarek focuses on the practical application—keeping the wood-core machines running in a world designed to kill them.
- **Interrogation Survivor:** Captured during a mission near Cradle Zero, Jarek was interrogated by the Core's security units. He successfully withheld the coordinates of the resistance base, earning the deep respect of the "Crew."

## Personality & Psychology
- **Pragmatic Skeptic:** Jarek is less interested in the "King of the Gorgons" prophecy and more interested in the thermal efficiency of Lem's chassis. He is a realist who understands the technological gap between the North and the Hive Cities.
- **Loyal Operator:** In Myrr's absence, Jarek serves as the technical backbone of the crew. He is the one who implements the "Analog Interface" strategies and manages the logistics of the Headless Striders.
- **Somatic Stress:** He exhibits high levels of "Aetheric stress" when near high-output vessels like Lem or Rahu, often monitoring them with a mix of awe and terror.

## Narrative Role
- **Technology Representative:** Jarek represents the "working class" of the resistance—the people who have to fix the world after the gods (Vessels) break it.
- **Infiltration Expert:** He often suggests the practical entry points for Missions 2 and 3, bypassing Core sensors through manual overrides.
- **The Bridge:** When Myrr is unavailable, Jarek is the primary technician Lem interacts with for repairs and data-analysis.

## Skills & Abilities
- **Wood-Core Maintenance:** Expert in repairing and maintaining the "grown" machinery used by the White Forest.
- **Stealth Logistics:** Specialized in "thermal ghosting"—moving large payloads across the desert without triggering Archivist satellite detection.
- **Signal Analysis:** Capable of decoding Core broadcasts through analog filters.

## Relationships
- **Myrr:** Mentor and leader; Jarek respects his vision but occasionally finds his philosophy restrictive.
- **Lem:** Regards Lem with caution, viewing him as a "beautiful but dangerous engine."
- **Arlo:** Loyal to Arlo's leadership, seeing him as the only hope for the northern villages.

## Key Moments
- **The Return:** Jarek is the one who recovers Lem at the meeting point outside Cradle Zero after the first failed assault.
- **The Proposal:** Suggests the "Infiltration Gambit" when the direct kinetic approach fails.
- **The Grid Audit:** Identifies the "decoy" status of the North-Eastern Node before the final collapse.
