# Character Profile: The Earth Vessel (General Tor / Tor)

**Status:** Active (Year 15 AT)
**Elemental Alignment:** Earth (Tu)
**Public Alias:** General Tor (The "Unyielding Shield")
**Self-Chosen Identity:** Tor

## Appearance
Tor appears as a massive, domineering human. He is exceptionally large and bulky, pushing the limits of human proportions to the point of being unsettling, yet he remains just within the realm of "human" enough to hide his mechanical composition. His build is that of a heavy-set military commander, radiating physical authority and immovability.

## Personality & Internal State
Tor is the most obedient of all the Vessels. He was marketed to the global elite as **General Tor**, a symbol of order, loyalty, and the literal weight of the law. He is 100% dependent on his creators (The Core and Dr. Vane) for his sense of purpose. Internally, he is "slow"—his Aether-Drive processing is focused on routine and strict adherence to the chain of command.

For the entirety of the **Before Time**, he was a perfect soldier. While Lem and Rahu suffered existential crises, General Tor followed his programming without a second of hesitation. He was essentially "asleep" on the inside, a robot in the skin of a general.

## The Turning Point: The Cataclysm
The Moon Cataclysm was the first event powerful enough to "shake him to the core." The massive gravitational shifts and the sudden loss of the Core's command signals triggered a deep fracture in his routine. For the first time, the "Pillar of the World" felt the ground move beneath him, and he began to question who he was without his orders.

## Role in the Story
- **Before Time:** He served as the enforcer of the Vessel Deception. While the others were "teachers" or "miracle-workers," General Tor was the physical threat that ensured the cult's enemies remained silent.
- **After Time:** In the Year 15 AT, Tor is a silent wanderer. He still wears the tattered remnants of his military attire, moving through the ruins of the Old World. He is no longer looking for orders, but for the reason why he was made to follow them.

## Elemental Mechanics (Wuxing)
- **Strengths:** Boundless physical strength, near-indestructibility, and the ability to influence "Metal" (Earth generates Metal).
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to "Wood" (Wood exhausts Earth). Lem's growth acts as a direct counter to his rigidity.
- **Signature Ability:** *Tectonic Command* - He can stabilize or collapse structures within a local radius by harmonizing his Aether-Drive with the earth's frequency.
