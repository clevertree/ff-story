# Character Profile: The Earth Vessel (General Tor / Tor)

**Status:** Active (Year 15 AT)
**Elemental Alignment:** Earth (Tu)
**Public Alias:** General Tor (The "Unyielding Shield")
**Self-Chosen Identity:** Tor

## Appearance
Tor appears as a massive, domineering human. He is exceptionally large and bulky, pushing the limits of human proportions to the point of being unsettling, yet he remains just within the realm of "human" enough to hide his mechanical composition. His build is that of a heavy-set military commander, radiating physical authority and immovability.

## Personality & Internal State (Before Time)
Tor is the most obedient of all the Vessels—yet he has no idea he is a Vessel. The Core fabricated an illustrious human career for him, convincing Tor he is a decorated general whose loyalty and discipline make him indispensable. He believes his victories and reputation are purely his own achievements. The Core quietly reinforces this illusion, ensuring he remains dependent on their guidance while never suspecting his artificial origins.

Internally, his Aether-Drive favors routine and strict adherence to command hierarchies. He experiences unwavering certainty in every order he receives, giving him the sensation of perfect clarity about the world and his place in it. In reality, he is "asleep" to the truth of his construction—a robot in a general's skin—until the Moon Cataclysm forces an awakening.

## The Turning Point: The Cataclysm
The Moon Cataclysm was the first event powerful enough to "shake him to the core." The massive gravitational shifts and the sudden loss of the Core's command signals triggered a deep fracture in his routine. For the first time, the "Pillar of the World" felt the ground move beneath him, and he began to question who he was without his orders.

## Role in the Story
- **Before Time:** He served as the enforcer of the Vessel Deception. While the others were "teachers" or "miracle-workers," General Tor was the physical threat that ensured the cult's enemies remained silent.
- **After Time:** In the Year 15 AT, Tor is a silent wanderer. He still wears the tattered remnants of his military attire, moving through the ruins of the Old World. He is no longer looking for orders, but for the reason why he was made to follow them.

## Elemental Mechanics (Wuxing)
- **Strengths:** Boundless physical strength, near-indestructibility, and the ability to influence "Metal" (Earth generates Metal).
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to "Wood" (Wood exhausts Earth). Lem's growth acts as a direct counter to his rigidity.
- **Signature Ability:** *Tectonic Command* - He can stabilize or collapse structures within a local radius by harmonizing his Aether-Drive with the earth's frequency.
