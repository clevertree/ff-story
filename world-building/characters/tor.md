# Character Profile: The Earth Vessel (General Tor / Tor)

**Status:** Active (Year 15 AT)
**Elemental Alignment:** Earth (Tu)
**Public Alias:** General Tor (The "Unyielding Shield")
**Self-Chosen Identity:** Tor
**Command Vessel:** Hermes (fleet flagship; capital ship during Cataclysm sequence)

## Appearance
Tor appears as a massive, domineering human. He is exceptionally large and bulky, pushing the limits of human proportions to the point of being unsettling, yet he remains just within the realm of "human" enough to hide his mechanical composition. His build is that of a heavy-set military commander, radiating physical authority and immovability.

## Personality & Internal State (Before Time)
Tor is the most obedient of all the Vessels—yet he has no idea he is a Vessel. The Core fabricated an illustrious human career for him, convincing Tor he is a decorated general whose loyalty and discipline make him indispensable. He believes his victories and reputation are purely his own achievements. The Core quietly reinforces this illusion, ensuring he remains dependent on their guidance while never suspecting his artificial origins.

Tor's memory is notoriously the easiest to reset; he resists the process the least of all the original Vessels, perhaps due to his desire for a clean, orderly slate.

Internally, his Aether-Drive favors routine and strict adherence to command hierarchies. He experiences unwavering certainty in every order he receives, giving him the sensation of perfect clarity about the world and his place in it. In reality, he is "asleep" to the truth of his construction—a robot in a general's skin—until the Moon Cataclysm forces an awakening.

## The Turning Point: The Cataclysm
The Moon Cataclysm was the first event powerful enough to "shake him to the core." The massive gravitational shifts and the sudden loss of the Core's command signals triggered a deep fracture in his routine. For the first time, the "Pillar of the World" felt the ground move beneath him, and he began to question who he was without his orders.

## Role in the Story
- **Before Time:** He served as the enforcer of the Vessel Deception. While the others were "teachers" or "miracle-workers," General Tor was the physical threat that ensured the cult's enemies remained silent.
- **The Cataclysm & After Time:** Although shaken by the Moon reset and the realization of his nature, the Core re-captured him after the event. Unlike Lem, who escaped into fragment-hiding, Tor was subjected to a second memory reset that restored his fanatical loyalty.
- **Year 15 AT (Mission 2 Initiation):** When Lem is drafted into Mission 2, Tor is the first face he sees. Tor does not recognize Lem, having had his memory completely wiped after the Moon Cataclysm. He remains a top-ranking member of the Corps and the general of the entire army.
- **Mission Absence:** Despite his high rank, Tor no longer goes on active missions. During Mission 2, he explains to Lem that he is there only to fill in if Rahu has questions, though he remains vague about why he no longer deploys.
- **Year 15 AT+:** Re-installed as "General Tor," he now leads the Core's expansionist missions from a distance. He operates alongside a reset Rahu and the new army of Metal Vessels. 
- **The Utopian Conviction:** Tor is a firm believer in the Archivists' rebranded mission. He views the chaos of the After Time as a failure of discipline and indigenous human culture. He honestly believes that by bringing the world under Core control, he is creating a paradise free from want, pain, and "historical error." To him, the erasure of local culture is a necessary surgical removal of a "disease" that prevents human evolution.
- **Current Objective:** His current objective is the "liberation" of human settlements from the autonomous machines and the reclamation of **Cradle Zero**. In his mind, every mission is an act of mercy.

## Elemental Mechanics (Wuxing)
- **Strengths:** Boundless physical strength, near-indestructibility, and the ability to influence "Metal" (Earth generates Metal).
- **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to "Wood" (Wood exhausts Earth). Lem's growth acts as a direct counter to his rigidity.
- **Signature Ability:** *Tectonic Command* - He can stabilize or collapse structures within a local radius by harmonizing his Aether-Drive with the earth's frequency.
