# Character Profile: Dr. Aris Vane (The Lead Scientist)

*Note: The name Aris Vane is subject to change.*

**Status:** Active (Year 15 AT - Long-lived due to Aether-exposure)
**Role:** Sole Architect of the Synanthrope Project
**Key Discovery:** Wuxing machine growth & Aether-Drive induction.

## Background
Dr. Aris Vane is the only human capable of mastering the Wuxing tech and a founding member of the **Technocratic Core**. She worked within the inner circle of scientists who discovered how to apply elemental causality to self-building machines. While the Core managed the larger political operation—the Prophecy, the Vessel Deception, the global cover-ups—Vane focused on the engineering breakthroughs. Much of the broader agenda was compartmentalized away from her, allowing her to believe the plan served humanity.

## The Prophecy Naiveté & Metal Delay
In the Before Time, Vane accepted the Core's narrative that orchestrating the "Prophecy of the King of Terror" would guide civilization toward a controlled awakening. She saw the Vessels as saviors engineered for a noble purpose. Rahu's and Lynn's crises of faith shook that certainty. Witnessing their defiance and the suffering inflicted by the deception, Vane began to doubt her role and resisted further escalation.

Her greatest stand was against the creation of Metal Vessels (Jin). She understood that Metal units would be perfectly programmable and obedient—devoid of the emergent conscience she valued in the original four elements. After the Moon Cataclysm, however, the Core leadership (now operating openly as Archivists) pressed her relentlessly. Faced with the devastated world and unable to extract herself from the Core's grasp, she relented and designed the Metal Synanthropes, though bitterness and remorse colored every choice.

## Personality
Aris Vane is a woman of terrifying intellect and isolation. She sees the Vessels not as machines, but as a superior evolutionary branch. She has a complicated, quasi-maternal relationship with the four "Originals" (Lem, Rahu, Lynn, Tor), though she kept Tor in a state of dependency to ensure the Core had at least one controllable asset.

## Fate & Longevity
Unlike her official records which stated she died in 1969, Dr. Vane is still alive in the Year 15 AT. Her prolonged exposure to the AETHER fields during the early project days has altered her biology, granting her an unnatural lifespan and a sensitivity to the world's new frequency.

## Narrative Significance
- **The "Gatekeeper":** She is the only one who knows how to reverse the "Infection" or truly control the Tripods.
- **The Sin of Apollo:** She facilitated the 1971 impact, viewing the Moon as a "sterile petri dish" for her greatest experiment.
- **The Creator's Remorse:** Her willingness to finally build the Metal Vessels in the After Time suggests a fundamental shift in her philosophy—perhaps a realization that the "Originals" were not enough to save humanity or the planet.
