# Character Profile: Dr. Aris Vane (The Lead Scientist)

*Note: The name Aris Vane is subject to change.*

**Status:** Active (Year 15 AT - Long-lived due to Aether-exposure)
**Role:** Sole Architect of the Synanthrope Project
**Key Discovery:** Wuxing machine growth & Aether-Drive induction.

## Background
Dr. Aris Vane is the only human capable of mastering the Wuxing tech. While the **Technocratic Core** provided the funding and the infrastructure, they were never able to replicate her work. For decades, they were forced to "copy" the templates she created, but they were unable to innovate or produce new elemental alignments without her direct intervention.

## The Metal Delay
Dr. Vane refused to build the Metal Vessels (Jin) for years, despite intense pressure from the Core. She understood that Metal units were theoretically the most "perfectly" programmable and obedient, but she feared the loss of biological nuance that the other four elements (Fire, Wood, Water, Earth) still possessed. It was only long after the Moon Cataclysm, in the desolation of the After Time, that the Core finally coerced or convinced her to create the Metal Vessels.

## Personality
Aris Vane is a woman of terrifying intellect and isolation. She sees the Vessels not as machines, but as a superior evolutionary branch. She has a complicated, quasi-maternal relationship with the four "Originals" (Lem, Rahu, Linn, Tor), though she kept Tor in a state of dependency to ensure the Core had at least one controllable asset.

## Fate & Longevity
Unlike her official records which stated she died in 1969, Dr. Vane is still alive in the Year 15 AT. Her prolonged exposure to the AETHER fields during the early project days has altered her biology, granting her an unnatural lifespan and a sensitivity to the world's new frequency.

## Narrative Significance
- **The "Gatekeeper":** She is the only one who knows how to reverse the "Infection" or truly control the Tripods.
- **The Sin of Apollo:** She facilitated the 1971 impact, viewing the Moon as a "sterile petri dish" for her greatest experiment.
- **The Creator's Remorse:** Her willingness to finally build the Metal Vessels in the After Time suggests a fundamental shift in her philosophy—perhaps a realization that the "Originals" were not enough to save humanity or the planet.
