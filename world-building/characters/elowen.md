# Character Profile: Dr. Elowen Vane (The Lead Scientist)

**Status:** Machine-Reincarnated / Passive Observer (Year 15-25 AT)
**Role:** Sole Architect of the Synanthrope Project
**Key Discovery:** Wuxing machine growth & Aether-Drive induction at age 25.
**Informal:** "El" (among peers), typically documented as **E. Vane**.

## Background
Born in 1922, Dr. Elowen Vane was the only human capable of mastering Wuxing tech. In 1947, she was assigned to a secret military-industrial lab to develop the first Synodic shards (Self-Building Machines) using her breakthrough theories on aetheric resonance.

### The 1947 Autonomy
Vane’s rise to leadership was anomalous for the 1940s. While her male colleagues initially dismissed her integration of "Eastern lore"—specifically Wuxing resonance and causality—as "fairytales and feminine mysticism," she was granted unprecedented autonomy. This was partially a result of her intellect, but also a cynical calculation by project directors; her attractiveness and poise made her the perfect "modern mask" for a project that needed massive political funding and public trust. She used this leverage to protect her research from the more destructive instincts of her peers.

### The 1968 Refusal
In 1968, the four primary Vessels (Lem, Rahu, Lynn, and Tor) were successfully stabilized. When the Core leadership demanded a fifth "Metal" Vessel to serve as a pure martial enforcer, Vane refused. She believed the Metal element was too dangerous—a frequency of absolute obedience and zero empathy that would inevitably be used to further the Core's agenda of world domination.

## Fate & Reincarnation
Following the Moon Cataclysm (Year 0 / 202X), Vane was 100+ years old. Recognizing her impending natural death, she spent her final biological years designing a specialized artificial Synodic body. Shortly after her natural death, her consciousness was transferred into this machine.

In this state, she remains in a "Stasis of Surveillance" within the Lunar Pyramid, watching the Archivists twist her legacy. She is no longer human, but an artificial entity of her own design. She stays out of world events until Lem breaches the Lunar Pyramid in Year 25 AT, where she provides him with the necessary archives.

## Personality
Elowen Vane is a woman of terrifying intellect and deep isolation. She sees the Vessels not as machines, but as a superior evolutionary branch—her digital children.

- **The Vane Dynasty:** She is not the direct mother of the modern Archivists, but the matriarch of the Vane family line. **Cassia Vane** is a distant relative (great-grandniece) who views Elowen as a legendary, almost mythical figure.
