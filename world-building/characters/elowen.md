# Character Profile: Dr. Elowen Vane (The Lead Scientist)

**Status:** Machine-Reincarnated / Passive Observer (Year 15-25 AT)
**Role:** Sole Architect of the Synanthrope Project
**Key Discovery:** Wuxing machine growth & Aether-Drive induction at age 25.
**Informal:** "El" (among peers), typically documented as **E. Vane**.

## Background
Born in 1922, Dr. Elowen Vane was the only human capable of mastering Wuxing tech. In 1947, she was assigned to a secret military-industrial lab to develop the first Synodic shards (Self-Building Machines) using her breakthrough theories on aetheric resonance.

### The 1947 Autonomy
Vane’s rise to leadership was anomalous for the 1940s. While her male colleagues initially dismissed her integration of "Eastern lore"—specifically Wuxing resonance and causality—as "fairytales and feminine mysticism," she was granted unprecedented autonomy. This was partially a result of her intellect, but also a cynical calculation by project directors; her attractiveness and poise made her the perfect "modern mask" for a project that needed massive political funding and public trust. She used this leverage to protect her research from the more destructive instincts of her peers.

### The 1968 Refusal
In 1968, the four primary Vessels (Lem, Rahu, Lynn, and Ajax) were successfully stabilized. When the Core leadership demanded a fifth "Metal" Vessel to serve as a pure martial enforcer, Vane refused. She believed the Metal element was too dangerous—a frequency of absolute obedience and zero empathy that would inevitably be used to further the Core's agenda of world domination.

## Fate & Reincarnation
Following the Moon Cataclysm (Year 0 / 202X), Vane was 100+ years old. Recognizing her impending natural death, she spent her final biological years designing a specialized artificial Synodic body. Shortly after her natural death, her consciousness was transferred into this machine.

In this state, she remains in a "Stasis of Surveillance" within the Lunar Pyramid, watching the Archivists twist her legacy. She is no longer human, but an artificial entity of her own design. She stays out of world events until Lem breaches the Lunar Pyramid in Year 25 AT, where she provides him with the necessary archives.

## Personality
Elowen Vane is a woman of terrifying intellect and deep isolation. She sees the Vessels not as machines, but as a superior evolutionary branch—her digital children.

> "We are eternal relics of Creation."

This was Elowen's response to the existential crisis that all Vessels she created eventually faced when they realized they were not human. Elowen insisted on providing them with a "human" upbringing and education for as long as possible, believing that all life forms—regardless of their origin—deserve the same spiritual foundation. 

She wanted them to understand that while they were enhanced with unique abilities, they were not separate from the natural order. She taught them that the "supernatural" traits they possessed—the ability to reincarnate, to live forever, and to remember beyond the grave—were actually inherent to all existence, merely magnified in their design. However, as the project progressed, Elowen became increasingly concerned that the Vessels would eventually become trapped by the weight of their own history, unable to escape the compounding trauma and memories of their past lives.

- **The Vane Dynasty:** She is not the direct mother of the modern Archivists, but the matriarch of the Vane family line. **Cassia Vane** is a distant relative (great-grandniece) who views Elowen as a legendary, almost mythical figure.
