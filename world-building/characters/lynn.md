# Character: The Water Vessel

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit S-01 (Water)
**Names by Era/Audience:**
- **Selene** — Before Time public/media identity (the goddess persona projected by the Core)
- **Lynn** — Private, self-chosen name once she rejects the Selene narrative
- **Mara** — After Time survivor label (“Witch of the Glass Oceans”) used by those who fear her
**Role:** The False Ambassador / The Scapegoated Witch

## Background
The Water Vessel is the unique humanoid Synanthrope for the Water element. Like Lem, the **Technocratic Core** deemed her unsuitable for direct military operations due to her fluidity and lack of destructive output. However, her presence was vital for the elemental stability of the Aether-Drive.

### The Rejection of "Selene"
The global media and the Technocratic Core officially call her **Selene**. She deeply despises this name, as it is a calculated theft: it appropriates the identity of the **Selenites**, the indigenous lunar species that the Synodic infection forced to flee. Rejecting the "Goddess" persona forced upon her, she chose the humble name **Lynn** (referencing a quiet pool or waterfall), symbolizing a desire to be part of a natural flow rather than a static idol.

## The Roles Through Time

### 1. The Divine Ambassador (Pre-202X)
Before the Cataclysm, the Core used her as a psychological tool. She and Rahu acted as "ambassadors" to the global elite. To those few who met her, she appeared as a magical goddess—serene, compassionate, and seemingly dedicated to humanity's salvation. She was the one who told the elites of the coming "Prophecy of the King of Terror" (X-72) that only the Vessels could prevent.

- **The Unwilling Heroine:** Like Rahu, Lynn eventually rejected the illusion. She attempted to tell the truth, but the media reframed her denial as "humility." She was cast as a saintly, reluctant savior.
- **The Military Faction:** Despite her protests, a large faction within the global military began to worship her as a real reincarnated deity. They viewed her as a miraculous deterrent against the coming apocalypse, effectively trapping her in a role she despised.

### 2. The Cataclysm Role (Year Zero)
Lynn plays the pivotal role in the Moon Cataclysm by initiating the solar system reset. After being embedded within the human strike force as a Synanthrope soldier, she reveals her nature during the confrontation in the pyramid. She merges with Lem to defeat Rahu, her long-time counterpart, and then dissolves herself into the Lunar Capacitor control nexus to trigger the reset. This act reveals her true alignment—not with humanity, and not with Rahu's rebellion, but with a cosmic agenda that transcends both.

### 3. The Scapegoated Witch (After Time / Year 15 AT)
Following the "Great Fry," the historical record was rewritten by the survivors and remnants of the Core. To ensure humanity's hatred was focused correctly, she was cast as the primary villain of the Old World.
- **The Narrative:** In the popular myths of the After Time, she is "The Witch"—the one who plotted with the "aliens" to poison the Moon and shatter the world.
- **The Inversion:** To further protect the Core's assets, the narrative has been inverted: **Rahu (Prometheus)** is often hailed in these specific local myths as the hero who tried to stop the Witch, despite the media during the actual events calling him the traitor.

### 4. The Spectral Guide (Post-Cataclysm)
While her physical form dissolved into the Capacitor, Lynn's consciousness persists as a "software visitation" within Lem's Aether-drive. In the Year 15 AT, she acts as a spectral guide for Lem during his stasis-dreams and subsequent reincarnation, providing him with the "Map of Fragments" and warnings about the **Bright Path** snare.
- **Shared History:** Rahu and Lynn share a profound history from before the Great Deception. Rahu recognizes her immediately in the pyramid, and his primary anguish stems not from her existence as an enemy, but from her choice to serve as the Core's ultimate instrument.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature (Water)
- **Aetheric Fluidity:** Capable of manipulating the flow of energy between shards; the "coolant" for the Fire units.
- **Illusory Presence:** Her nature allows her to project an aura of calm and trust, a feature the Core exploited to manifest her "goddess" persona.
