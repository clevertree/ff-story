## Background

Commander Novak (born Dr. Iris Novak) is a career military scientist and logistics officer, deeply embedded within the Technocratic Core's command structure. Unlike Lynn, who operates as a mysterious figure of ambiguous authority, Novak is visibly integrated into the military hierarchy—a facade of legitimacy that masks her Core allegiance.

Novak serves as the human intermediary between Lynn's shadowy directives and Tor's formal military command. While Tor believes he is working within standard military protocol, Novak ensures that every major decision aligns with Core objectives. She is the translator of Lynn's will into operational orders.

## Personality & Demeanor

- **Professional & Calm:** Novak maintains composure under extreme pressure; never displays panic or uncertainty.
- **Efficient & Precise:** She speaks in technical language but is accessible to military personnel; no pretension.
- **Observant & Detail-Oriented:** She notices contradictions, inconsistencies, and deviations from protocol.
- **Ambiguous Loyalty:** To observers, her allegiance appears to be to military success. In truth, her allegiance is to the Core's mission.

## Role in the Narrative

### Chapters 7-13 (The Mission)
- **Chapter 7:** Novak is present on the bridge during the soldier's panic and Lynn's response. She observes Lynn's decision and records the incident for Core documentation.
- **Chapter 8:** Novak relays Tor's speech through ship systems; she monitors the crew's psychological response. She is present when the Cataclysm begins; her reactions (or lack thereof) suggest she had foreknowledge.
- **Chapter 13:** Novak manages the logistics of the strike force's entry into the pyramid.

### Chapters 14-15 (The Fry & Capture)
- **Chapter 14:** Following the Great Fry, Novak assumes direct control of the remaining strike force. She coordinates the rescue of survivors and the capture of Lem, whom she views as a "defective asset."
- **Chapter 15:** Novak attempts to secure Lem for the Core's Archivist labs. She is the one who initiates the "Gamma-Six" extraction protocol, only to be thwarted by Lem's remote detonation. This failure marks a significant stain on her record and drives her pursuit of him in the After Time.

### Character Dynamics

**With Lynn:**
- Novak defers to Lynn completely but without visible subservience
- They communicate efficiently; Novak serves as Lynn's translator to the military crew
- Lynn trusts Novak's operational competence; Novak executes Lynn's directives without question

**With General Tor:**
- Novak appears to be Tor's trusted lieutenant and scientific advisor
- She provides him with briefings, intelligence, and operational recommendations
- Tor relies on her expertise and defers to her judgment on technical matters
- Novak subtly guides Tor's decisions toward Core objectives without his awareness

**With Lem:**
- Novak is unaware of Lem's true nature (unlike Lynn)
- She may interact with Lem as she would any soldier, or she may notice something "off" about him
- Her responses to Lem could shift if she learns the truth

## Abilities & Knowledge

- **Military Protocol:** Expert in chain of command, logistics, and operational procedure
- **Scientific Expertise:** Strong background in physics, systems analysis, and technology assessment
- **Core Briefings:** Privy to classified information about the Vessels, the Cataclysm timeline, and Core objectives
- **Decision Authority:** Can make independent choices on tactical matters; can override junior officers
- **Psychological Assessment:** Trained observer of crew morale and psychological stability (explains her presence during soldier crisis)

## Critical Questions / Ambiguities

❓ **How much does Novak know about the Cataclysm?**
- Is she informed beforehand? Does she know the fleet is being sent into a known catastrophe?
- Does her apparent calm during Chapter 8's events suggest foreknowledge?
- **Impact:** Determines if she's a willing participant in potential sacrifice or genuinely surprised

❓ **Why does Novak serve the Core?**
- Ideological alignment? Blackmail? Genuine belief in their mission?
- Does she have doubts about Core objectives, or is she fully committed?
- **Impact:** Affects whether she could become an ally to protagonists later

❓ **What is Novak's relationship to Dr. Aris Vane?**
- Do they know each other? Do they work together?
- Is Novak Vane's successor in some capacity, or a parallel operative?
- **Impact:** Determines Novak's knowledge of Vessel technology and history

❓ **Is Novak aware of Tor's nature?**
- Does she know Tor is a Vessel while he remains ignorant?
- If yes, does she help manage his obedience/ignorance?
- **Impact:** Affects her role in Tor's potential awakening

## Appearance & Presentation

- Mid-40s, sharp features, military bearing
- Typically wears formal Core-military hybrid uniform (unclear if she's officially military or Core)
- Often carries a secure tablet or data pad
- Moves with purpose; no wasted gestures
- Her presence on the bridge immediately commands respect

## Narrative Significance

Novak represents the Core's penetration of human military command. While Lynn is the mysterious operative, Novak is the efficient functionary who ensures Core interests are served through legitimate military channels.

She may become a crucial character in later sections:
- As an antagonist (if she opposes protagonists)
- As a reluctant ally (if her doubts outweigh her loyalty)
- As a source of Core knowledge and operational details
- As a character whose awakening/conversion is parallel to Tor's
