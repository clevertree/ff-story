# Character: Arlo

**Full Name:** Arlo
**Role:** Supporting Character / Protagonist's Ally
**Birth:** ~AT 1 (Year 1 After Time)
**Status:** Human Survivor

## Background
Arlo was born in the immediate shadow of the Cataclysm, a member of the "After Time" generation who has never known a world without the smog-choked sky or the distant silhouettes of Monoliths. Raised in a small, isolated village in the northern forests, he grew up in a culture that treats technology with a mixture of religious dread and primitive superstition.

Unlike his elders, who view the machines as divine punishment or inexplicable monsters, Arlo possesses an intuitive, almost uncanny understanding of Synodic technology. He is a "Tech-Welder"—not in the sense of a trained engineer, but as a fearless scavenger who sees the beauty and utility in the humming, alien components left behind by the Core.

## Personality
- **Tech-Curious:** Arlo is driven by a deep-seated curiosity about how things work. He spends his nights repairing scavenged Core beacons or tinkering with discarded shards, much to the dismay of his community.
- **The Outcast:** Because of his affinity for technology, Arlo is viewed as "unclean" or "cursed" by his village. He is a social pariah, living on the fringes of the community that fears his gifts will bring the "Gorgon's Eye" upon them.
- **Fearless Realist:** While others cower at the sight of a Tripod, Arlo observes them with the same interest he would a strange animal. He is one of the few humans who realizes that the machines are not inherently aggressive unless provoked.
- **Independent Thinker:** He possesses a sharp, critical mind that rejects both the village's superstition and the Core's "False Hero" propaganda.

## Connection to Ren
Arlo first encounters Ren during his third mission (the Northern Shield). While the other villagers treat Ren with terrified reverence (seeing him as one of the Archivists' "Saviors"), Arlo is the first person to look past the Vessel's armor and see the boy underneath.

He recognizes the "remote control" flickers in Ren's movements and identifies with Ren's status as a being controlled by systems they didn't choose. Their bond is built on a shared language of tech and the mutual experience of being "lemons" within their respective societies.

## Narrative Role: The Refusal
Following the manufactured conflict in his village, Arlo is offered a position within the Technocratic Core as a "Synodic Analyst" or trainee. After witnessing the Metal Vessel's unprovoked attack on a non-aggressive Tripod—and realizing the Core uses the machines as pawns to manufacture their own heroism—Arlo explicitly refuses recruitment. 

His choice to remain in the "dirt" rather than join the "sky" serves as a pivotal moment of moral clarity for Ren, reinforcing Ren's secret desire to break free from his own mission constraints.
