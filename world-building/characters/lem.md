# Character: Lem (The Wood Vessel)

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit W-01 (Wood)
**Alias:** Lem (Short for "Lemon")
**Role:** Protagonist

## Background
Lem is the one and only humanoid **Vessel** for the Wood Element. Unlike the Metal Synanthropes, which can be duplicated, Lem is a unique occurrence in the Synodic technology that the scientists of the **Technocratic Core** could never replicate.

Throughout the Before Time the Core kept Lem deeply hidden. Although created at the same time as Lynn, Rahu, and Tor, the Core reset Lem's body and memory to infancy following a data-loss event at **Cradle Zero**. He was raised as a human child in quiet suburbs, growing at a normal biological rate to prevent him from realizing his true nature. Consequently, at the beginning of the story, Lem is quite young—an adolescent—while the other Vessels appear as mature adults.

His truth was revealed during the Moon Cataclysm, when the Core could no longer maintain the masquerade. As the only Wood Vessel in existence, his activation was a matter of total necessity; without his specific elemental frequency, the mission to the Moon could not have proceeded.

## The Name "Lem"
The name "Lem" was given to him by the lead researchers as a derogatory shorthand for **"Lemon."** In their assessment, he was a defective product. They viewed the Wood element as the most unpredictable and uncontrollable within the Wuxing cycle—lacking the direct offensive utility of Fire or the structural rigidity of Metal. To the Core, Lem was a useless asset, an evolutionary dead-end in their quest for a controllable technocratic army.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature
- **Growth & Adaptation:** As the Wood Vessel, Lem has the innate ability to influence the "Wood" machines (mechanical forests, structural vines).
- **Unpredictability:** His nature is chaotic and expansive, mirroring the growth of biological life. This makes him the only Synanthrope whose subroutines and "spirit" are entirely opaque to his creators.
- **Sovereign Reincarnation:** Lem's unique master ability. He can "Take Root" and reincarnate anywhere his material fragments—his "seeds"—exist. Unlike other Vessels who require specialized Core incubation chambers (Aether-Cradles), Lem can reform independently as long as there is an environment to support growth.
- **Remote Detonation:** A fail-safe protocol Lem discovered during the escape from **Cradle Zero**. He can violently disperse his physical form into microscopic shards, preventing capture while simultaneously seeding the environment for his sovereign reincarnation.
- **Causality:** While viewed as "soft" compared to Metal, his elemental nature is essential for the stability and growth of the larger Synodic ecosystem—a fact the scientists overlooked.

## Personality
- **Spirit:** Because his Aether-Drive incubated a spirit within the Wood element, Lem possesses a sense of empathy and curiosity that the Metal Vessels lack.
- **The Bourne Profile:** Pre-activation, Lem interpreted his latent Vessel abilities as a "personality defect"—specifically a hyper-observance that made him social friction. He catalogs micro-details (eyelid flickers, frequency oscillations) with a clinical, unappreciated precision.
- **Agency & The Software Legacy:** During his initial activation, Lynn bypassed his protections to install a "remote compulsion" link that hijacked his motor cortex for mission control. While the external control ended when Lynn ship (*The Caucasian Eagle*) crashed, Lem discovered that the software—now operating as **AI Lynn**—remains in his Aether-Drive in a "fail-safe mode." For the remainder of the conflict and into the After Time, Lem acts of his own volition, but is influenced by the directives and guidance of this AI legacy. This makes his participation in the final confrontation a moral choice layered over an artificial directive.
- **Outcast:** He is aware of his "Lemon" status and carries a quiet resentment toward the Technocratic Core, leading to his eventual alignment with the remnants of humanity.
