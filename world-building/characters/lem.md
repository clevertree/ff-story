# Character: Lem (The Wood Vessel)

**Full Designation:** Synanthrope Unit W-01 (Wood)
**Alias:** Lem (Short for "Lemon")
**Role:** Protagonist

## Background
Lem is the one and only humanoid **Vessel** for the Wood Element. Unlike the Metal Synanthropes, which can be duplicated, Lem is a unique occurrence in the Synodic technology that the scientists of the **Technocratic Core** could never replicate.

Throughout the Before Time the Core kept Lem deeply hidden. He was raised in quiet suburbs under the belief that he was an ordinary human teenager, insulated from the Vessel Deception and monitored from afar. The truth of his construction and abilities only surfaced during the Moon Cataclysm, when the Core could no longer maintain the masquerade.

## The Name "Lem"
The name "Lem" was given to him by the lead researchers as a derogatory shorthand for **"Lemon."** In their assessment, he was a defective product. They viewed the Wood element as the most unpredictable and uncontrollable within the Wuxing cycle—lacking the direct offensive utility of Fire or the structural rigidity of Metal. To the Core, Lem was a useless asset, an evolutionary dead-end in their quest for a controllable technocratic army.

## Abilities & Elemental Nature
- **Growth & Adaptation:** As the Wood Vessel, Lem has the innate ability to influence the "Wood" machines (mechanical forests, structural vines).
- **Unpredictability:** His nature is chaotic and expansive, mirroring the growth of biological life. This makes him the only Synanthrope whose subroutines and "spirit" are entirely opaque to his creators.
- **Causality:** While viewed as "soft" compared to Metal, his elemental nature is essential for the stability and growth of the larger Synodic ecosystem—a fact the scientists overlooked.

## Personality
- **Spirit:** Because his Aether-Drive incubated a spirit within the Wood element, Lem possesses a sense of empathy and curiosity that the Metal Vessels lack.
- **The Bourne Profile:** Pre-activation, Lem interpreted his latent Vessel abilities as a "personality defect"—specifically a hyper-observance that made him social friction. He catalogs micro-details (eyelid flickers, frequency oscillations) with a clinical, unappreciated precision.
- **Agency & The Broken Link:** During his initial activation, Lynn installed a "remote compulsion" link that hijacked his motor cortex. This link was severed when Lynn's ship (*The Caucasian Eagle*) crashed during the Moon Cataclysm. For the remainder of the conflict, Lem acts of his own volition, choosing to stay with the mission out of Necessity rather than force. This makes his participation in the final confrontation a moral choice rather than a programmed response.
- **Outcast:** He is aware of his "Lemon" status and carries a quiet resentment toward the Technocratic Core, leading to his eventual alignment with the remnants of humanity.
