# Vector

**Archetype:** Lead Metal Vessel Mission Soldier
**Affiliation:** The Core
**Status:** Active (Continuously Reincarnated)

## Overview
Vector is the lead Metal Vessel Mission soldier of the Metal Vessel tactical units. Unlike the standard rank-and-file Metal Vessels who retain minimal personality for maximum efficiency, Vector has been granted a slightly higher cognitive threshold to facilitate leadership and independent tactical decision-making on high-stakes missions. 

He serves as the primary point of contact for Core leadership (General Tor, Cassia Vane) and the Wood Vessel (Lem) during field operations. 

## Appearance & Attributes
- **Physicality:** A lean, optimized frame of brushed tungsten-polycarbonate alloy. His movements are terrifyingly devoid of wasted energy—every step and strike is a calculated vector of force.
- **Combat Style:** Master of multiple disciplinary combat forms. He is capable of challenging high-tier combatants like General Tor through pure algorithmic precision, though he lacks the creative "spark" or raw elemental power to overcome Rahu.
- **Personality:** Rigid, clinical, and absolutely loyal. He possesses a dry, mission-focused demeanor that borders on a personality, but he fundamentally lacks an internal life or capacity for doubt.

## Narrative Role: The Loop of Loyalty
Vector represents the absolute mastery the Core has over the reincarnation process. Throughout the story (Missions 2 through 5), Vector may be destroyed multiple times. However, he always returns for the next operation, his consciousness "reset" and his memories meticulously curated by the Core's data-scrubbers.

He acts as a foil to Lem and Tor, both of whom undergo profound internal changes. Vector is the "constant"—a man-machine who denies all contradictory information and remains a perfect slave to his programming until the very end.

## Key Relationships
- **Lem (The Wood Vessel):** Vector views Lem as a tactical asset to be managed, showing no resentment or kinship despite their shared status as Vessels.
- **General Tor:** Respects Tor as the pinnacle of human tactical command, serving as his right hand in the field until Tor's eventual defection.
- **Rahu:** Views Rahu as a catastrophic "variable" that must be neutralized, though he is internally coded with a "threat-avoidance" protocol regarding the Fire Vessel.
