## Physical Description
- **Age:** Mid-20s.
- **Appearance:** Wiry and athletic, wearing high-density fiber armor woven with conductive silver. She is often seen wearing a specialized headset for long-range communication.
- **Key Features:** Her movements are characterized by a singular, focused efficiency. Her "Water-Element" spiritual signature is noted for its high degree of processing stability.

## Background & Origin
- **The New Generation:** Ku belongs to the generation born After Time who grew up entirely within the White Forest's shadow. Unlike the elders who remember the pre-Fry world, she views the current ecosystem as a puzzle to be solved and defended.
- **Tactical Training:** She rose through the ranks of Myrr's crew not through mechanical skill, but through her ability to coordinate complex, multi-unit engagements.

## Personality & Psychology
- **Efficient & Resolute:** Ku does not engage in the philosophical debates common in the sanctuary. She focuses on objective, tactical reality. When the "Suns Fall," she is the one who keeps the evacuation orderly.
- **The "Water" Balance:** Although not a Vessel, Ku possesses a natural "Water-Element" resonance that makes her an excellent counterpart to Lem’s "Wood" volatility. She provides the calm, analytical flow during high-stress combat.
- **Protective:** Intensely dedicated to the survival of the northern groves and her fellow crew members.

## Narrative Role
- **Field Commander:** Whenever Myrr is focused on engineering or leadership, Ku is the one in the field directing the Striders and Monoliths.
- **Tactical Liaison:** She works closely with Lem during his fifth mission (the Lunar Assault), serving as his primary comms-link and tactical advisor.
- **The Voice of Warning:** Ku is the first to identify the kinetic shields' failure against orbital-intensity energy, forcing the move to "Plan B."

## Skills & Abilities
- **Fleet Coordination:** Master of synchronized unit movement; she can handle the logistics of a hundred-unit march with zero acoustic emission.
- **Aetheric Telemetry:** Expert at reading the "glow" of the world and predicting where the next strike will land.
- **Strategic Deception:** Specialist in "Narrative Traps," using dummy signals to lure Core interceptors away from the primary mission.

## Relationships
- **Myrr:** Views him with deep respect, though she is more willing to risk direct engagement than he is.
- **Lem:** A close tactical partner. Their relationship is built on shared battlefield intensity and mutual trust in each other's "signatures."

## Key Moments
- **The Gathering of Strands:** Coordinates the move of all defensive assets to the north to protect the five villages.
- **The Lunar Ascent:** Occupies the command seat of the lead transport during the final breach of the Lunar Pyramid.
- **The Final Lesson:** Informs Lem of the terminal vulnerability to orbital strikes, catalyzing the final decision to reset.
