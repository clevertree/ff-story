# Location: Megacities

The Megacities are the primary urban centers established by the Technocratic Core in the After Time. Unlike the **Cradles**, these locations do not house reincarnation laboratories; they are designed as populated hubs for the Archivist's "Utopian" expansion.

**Note on Industrial Separation:** Megacities are distinct from **Fire Cities**. While a Megacity may be built in proximity to a Fire City to access the energy grid, they are always separated by a "buffer zone" (typically 20-50 miles) due to the extreme thermal criticality and radioactive smog generated by the Pillars of Fire.

## Overview
Megacities are constructed using Synodic manufacturing, appearing almost overnight in strategic regions. They are primarily located in the **Equatorial Dead Zone** (surrounding the desert base) or in the **North**, where former human villages have been forcibly converted into high-tech urban centers.

## The Paradise Protocol
These cities are marketed to the starving, hiding remnants of humanity as being completely free from "want and pain." They provide:
- Clean, synthetic energy and food.
- Climate-controlled environments.
- Absolute security from wild mechanical fauna.

## The Hook (Technocratic Dependency)
Entry into a Megacity requires the complete abandonment of indigenous culture and total reliance on Core technology. They are "beautiful prisons" where human history is replaced by the Archivist's "Correct Calendar" and individual agency is surrendered for physical comfort.

## Legacy Foundations
Many Megacities are built directly atop the **Ruined Megacities** of the Before Time—scavenged husks of 21st-century cities that were reclaimed and refashioned after being overrun by Mechanical Cell flora during the Great Fry.

## Primary Hubs
Located around the **Ember Basin** and the **Cable Trail**:
- **Azure Zenith:** Northern guardian of the basin.
- **Crystalline Reach:** High-altitude moisture harvesting spire.
- **The Glass Spires:** Northeast hub built on vitrified ruins.
- **Iron Meridian:** The transit heart of the Cable Trail.
- **Radiant Dawn:** Geothermal power hub on the Rift's edge.
- **The Obsidian Gate:** The Core's primary southwestern portal and coastal port.
