# Location: Megacities

The Megacities are the primary urban centers established by the Technocratic Core in the After Time. Unlike the **Cradles**, these locations do not house reincarnation laboratories; they are designed as populated hubs for the Archivist's "Utopian" expansion.

## Overview
Megacities are constructed using Synodic manufacturing, appearing almost overnight in strategic regions. They are primarily located in the **Equatorial Dead Zone** (surrounding the desert base) or in the **North**, where former human villages have been forcibly converted into high-tech urban centers.

## The Paradise Protocol
These cities are marketed to the starving, hiding remnants of humanity as being completely free from "want and pain." They provide:
- Clean, synthetic energy and food.
- Climate-controlled environments.
- Absolute security from wild mechanical fauna.

## The Hook (Technocratic Dependency)
Entry into a Megacity requires the complete abandonment of indigenous culture and total reliance on Core technology. They are "beautiful prisons" where human history is replaced by the Archivist's "Correct Calendar" and individual agency is surrendered for physical comfort.

## Legacy Foundations
Many Megacities are built directly atop the **Ruined Megacities** of the Before Time—scavenged husks of 21st-century cities that were reclaimed and refashioned after being overrun by Mechanical Cell flora during the Great Fry.
