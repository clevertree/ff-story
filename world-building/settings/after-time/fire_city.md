# Location: The Fire City (Cradle Zero)

The **Fire City** is the colloquial name for **Cradle Zero**, the primary Synodic power-hub and terrestrial command center on Earth, located in the heart of the **Ember Basin** (formerly Central Africa). The term **Cradle** is reserved specifically for the two primary terrestrial and lunar sites that house Synodic reincarnation laboratories.

**Element Profile (Ember Basin):**
- **Metal:** 68%
- **Earth:** 15%
- **Fire:** 17%
- **Wood:** 0%
- **Water:** 0%

## The Ember Basin
Once a lush jungle known in the Before Time as the Ituri Forest, the Basin has been transformed into a vast red-sand desert. The persistent thermal output of the **Pillar of Fire** has stripped the moisture from the land, leaving a scorched wasteland defined by extreme heat and "Wild Synodics."

## The Gorgon Hive & The Silent Forge
The city is a massive, autonomous mechanical hive built and maintained by **Gorgons**. It is situated approximately **50 miles** from the ruins of a pre-Cataclysm industrial hub known as the **Silent Forge**. Unlike the static human ruins of the Before Time, the Fire City is a shifting, geometric architecture of metal and energy. It serves as a central hub for the redistribution of energy and materials via the **Cable Trail**.

## The Pillar of Fire & The Smoke
At the heart of the city stands the **Pillar of Fire**, a permanent thermal overload reaching into the upper atmosphere. This pillar is the result of autonomous machines continuously funneling energy into the ruins of the original facility.
- **The Smoke Cloud:** The intense heat of the pillar generates a thick, perpetual layer of smoke and ash that stretches for hundreds of miles in every direction. This localized atmospheric ionization effectively blocks the sun, creating a permanent twilight across the region.

## Global Distribution
While Cradle Zero is the primary site, the Core has established a network of Fire Cities along the **Equatorial Zone** and key geographic junctions:
- **The Salt Pillar:** Located in the northern **Cairo Salt Flats**, fueling the Continental Bridge.
- **The Steam Spire:** Positioned at the edge of the **Silver Bight**, monitoring the White Forest.
- **The Rift Furnace:** A chain of energy siphons along the **Great Rift Valley**.
- **The Meridian Forge:** Powering the central logistics of the **Cable Trail**.

## The Dead Zone
The **Equatorial Dead Zone** is the vast, scorched territory that surrounds the Fire City.
- **Scale:** It extends for hundreds of miles from the city's center.
- **Environment:** Defined by extreme heat, oppressive smoke, and "Wild Synodics"—machines that have gone feral and operate outside of Core control.
- **The Desert of Blends:** The outer perimeter of the Dead Zone, characterized by "blended" elemental wildlife (Wood-green metal, Water-blue fire) and shimmering glass dunes.

## Key Sites
- **The Desert Perimeter:** The fortified boundary surrounding the Dead Zone where the resistance ("The Crew") launched their final assault.
