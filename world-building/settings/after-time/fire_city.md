# Location: The Fire City (Cradle Zero)

The **Fire City** is the colloquial name for **Cradle Zero**, the primary Synodic power-hub and terrestrial command center on Earth. The term **Cradle** is reserved specifically for the two primary terrestrial and lunar sites that house Synodic reincarnation laboratories.

## The Gorgon Hive
The city is a massive, autonomous mechanical hive built and maintained by **Gorgons**—the multi-legged builder units of the Synodics. Unlike the static human ruins of the Before Time, the Fire City is a shifting, geometric architecture of metal and energy. It serves as a central hub for the redistribution of energy and materials across the planet.

## The Pillar of Fire & The Smoke
At the heart of the city stands the **Pillar of Fire**, a permanent thermal overload reaching into the upper atmosphere. This pillar is the result of autonomous machines continuously funneling energy into the ruins of the original facility.
- **The Smoke Cloud:** The intense heat of the pillar generates a thick, perpetual layer of smoke and ash that stretches for hundreds of miles in every direction. This localized atmospheric ionization effectively blocks the sun, creating a permanent twilight across the region.

## The Dead Zone
The **Equatorial Dead Zone** is the vast, scorched territory that surrounds the Fire City.
- **Scale:** It extends for hundreds of miles from the city's center.
- **Environment:** Defined by extreme heat, oppressive smoke, and "Wild Synodics"—machines that have gone feral and operate outside of Core control.
- **The Desert of Blends:** The outer perimeter of the Dead Zone, characterized by "blended" elemental wildlife (Wood-green metal, Water-blue fire) and shimmering glass dunes.

## Key Sites
- **The Desert Perimeter:** The fortified boundary surrounding the Dead Zone where the resistance ("The Crew") launched their final assault.
