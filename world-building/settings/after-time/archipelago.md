# Setting: The Core Archipelago

The Core Archipelago is a series of floating island bases established by the Core in the After Time (AT), representing their transition from a secretive cabal into a dominant world order.

## Origins and Construction
Following the Moon Cataclysm (0 AT), the Core utilized small fragments of the moon as the foundation for these bases. By leveraging their remote control of Synodic life from **Cradle Alpha**, they rapidly developed and deployed massive **Synodic Anti-Gravity Engines**. 
- **The Zero-G Layer:** The islands naturally hang in the zero-gravity layer of the Earth's outer atmosphere.
- **Mobility:** The anti-gravity engines allow the Core to move the islands to-fro, up and down, across any global coordinate.

## The Sky Paradise (0 AT - 15 AT)
For the first fifteen years of the After Time, the Archipelago served as a "sky paradise" for rescued human populations.
- **Technological Surrender:** Upon entry, all citizens were required to surrender their "tainted" 202X digital technology. The Core claims these relics were riddled with alien backdoors designed to control or kill human populations.
- **Social Structure:** Small cities formed on the larger islands. The Core allowed citizens to keep their religions and traditions alive in exchange for their gratitude and obedience.
- **Flight Restrictions:** Movement was extremely limited; citizens were forbidden from visiting the ground without explicit permission, both to protect them from the "wild" ground and to prevent the discovery of relic technology.
- **The Reclamation Deference:** Between 0 AT and 15 AT, the Core convinced its citizens to defer to its control in the **Reclamation Project**, promising a utopia free from the mistakes of the old world.

## Major Islands
### Ark Prime
The largest sky city and the former capital of the Archipelago. Following the relocation of its citizens to terrestrial mega-cities around 15 AT, it was refactored into the Core's most formidable mobile weapon: the **Iron Pillar**.
- **Refit:** Its massive population centers were cleared to make room for oversized engines and a base-mounted **Scalar Cannon**.

### Ark Progenitor ("The Bridle")
A specialized scouting island designed for operations in Dead Zones and hostile thermal environments.
- **Design:** Unlike the city-islands, Ark Progenitor has no visible buildings on its surface. It resembles a windowless military bunker.
- **Function:** It is equipped with advanced filtration systems to operate in low-oxygen, high-smoke environments.
- **The Nickname:** Cynically called "The Bridle" by the Metal Vessels, as it is used to "harness" and subdue wild Synodic life, while simultaneously holding the Vessels on a short leash.

## Legacy
The Archipelago and the Reclamation Project demonstrate the extent of the Core's control over human populations by "holding the keys" to the Synodic technology they pioneered.
