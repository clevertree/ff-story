# Setting: The Moon (The Shattered Cradle)

Once a symbol of human achievement, the Moon is now the source of Earth's suffering.

## The After Time (The Fragmentation)
- **The Debris Belt:** The Moon is no longer a solid sphere but a cluster of massive, jagged fragments held together by erratic gravitational anomalies.
- **The Farside Cannon:** A massive, partially ruined structure on the largest lunar fragment. In the "Before Time," this was a single, colossal tube capable of launching Tripods.
- **Tripod Hives:** Structural "nests" built into the Lunar craters where the mechanical entities are manufactured and launched during the 15-day sun cycles.
- **Cradle Prime (formerly Cradle Prime):** The largest and most fortified fragment of the Moon, consisting of the far side. It still houses the **Cradle Prime** pyramid/moon base from the Before Time, which remains mostly intact and unchanged despite the lunar fragmentation. It serves as the headquarters for the Archivist Council. Along with Cradle Zero, it is the only location designated as a **Cradle**, housing the primary Synodic reincarnation laboratories.
    - **The Central Nexus:** The heart of the Pyramid where the Lunar Capacitor was located and where the global "Great Fry" was triggered.
    - **The New Lab:** A refashioned Archivist laboratory within Cradle Prime/Cradle Prime where Lem's aetheric presence was analyzed by Cassia Vane.
- **The Farside / The Apollo Landing Site:** The location of the initial 1971 infection and Rahu's long exile.
- **Lunar Orbit / The Near Moon:**
    - **Zenith:** A specific altitude and alignment point in lunar orbit where spacecraft begin their controlled descent to the far side.
- **The Silence:** No human contact remains with the Lunar Colonies. They are presumed "First-Strike" casualties of the Cataclysm.
