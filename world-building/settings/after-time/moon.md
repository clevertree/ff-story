# Setting: The Moon (The Shattered Cradle)

Once a symbol of human achievement, the Moon is now the source of Earth's suffering.

## The After Time (The Fragmentation)
- **The Moon Crack:** Occurred immediately after the Great Fry, serving as the physical failure that aborted the global reset. Kira’s rage shattered the lunar shell "like an egg."
- **The Debris Belt:** The Moon is no longer a solid sphere but a cluster of massive, jagged fragments held together by erratic gravitational anomalies.
- **Orbital Arc:** The fragments are spread across the orbital path in a long, jagged arc, with the majority of the bulk concentrated near the largest fragment (Cradle Prime).
- **The Glow of Death:** The inner moon-light no longer exists. There is no more natural moon-light in the After Time.
- **Lunar Plasma:** High-energy plasma arcs constantly between the shards. Intermittent lightning strikes between fragments are visible from Earth's surface. 
- **Telecommunication Interference:** This constant plasma discharge is the primary source of electronic imbalance, disrupting all long-distance wireless telecommunications across the planet.

## Environmental & Synodic Impact
- **Nocturnal Devastation:** The lack of biologically-essential moonlight has permanently disrupted the natural rhythms of Earth's flora and fauna.
- **Low-Power Hibernation:** Wild Synodic life, dependent on external heat or light, enters a state of immobile "low-power hibernation" during the dark nights.
- **Fire City Dominance:** Synodic entities within Fire Cities remain active 24/7, powered by the intense artificial heat and light of the Core's industrial hubs.
- **Cradle Prime (formerly Cradle Prime):** The largest and most fortified fragment of the Moon, consisting of the far side. It still houses the **Cradle Prime** pyramid/moon base from the Before Time, which remains mostly intact and unchanged despite the lunar fragmentation. It serves as the headquarters for the Archivist Council. Along with Cradle Zero, it is the only location designated as a **Cradle**, housing the primary Synodic reincarnation laboratories.
    - **The Central Nexus:** The heart of the Pyramid where the Lunar Capacitor was located and where the global "Great Fry" was triggered.
    - **The New Lab:** A refashioned Archivist laboratory within Cradle Prime/Cradle Prime where Ren's aetheric presence was analyzed by Cassia Vane.
- **The Farside / The Apollo Landing Site:** The location of the initial 1971 infection and Rahu's long exile.
- **Lunar Orbit / The Near Moon:**
    - **Zenith:** A specific altitude and alignment point in lunar orbit where spacecraft begin their controlled descent to the far side.
- **The Silence:** No human contact remains with the Lunar Colonies. They are presumed "First-Strike" casualties of the Cataclysm.
