# Location: The Northern Villages (The Arlo Enclave)

A cluster of five traditional human settlements that survived the Cataclysm by relying on low-tech methods and "Analog" shielding. This location was the primary theater for Lem's third mission.

## Environment & Architecture
The enclave is situated in a colder, alpine region of Earth where snow is a frequent presence. The landscape is dominated by dense, old-growth forests that provide an abundance of resources for the inhabitants.

The villages are highly organized and constructed entirely without modern technology. The houses are handcrafted from local timber, utilizing traditional woodworking techniques to withstand the harsh northern climate.

## Key Sites
- **Arlo's Village:** A community that treats technology with religious dread, where Arlo was raised as an outcast.
- **The Shore of Shadows:** A rugged, winding trail following the shoreline of the deep lake at the back of the village, leading to the resistance camp.
- **The Resistance Camp:** A shadowed, tech-cluttered clearing hidden near the village where Myrr and the "Crew" operate their scavenged gear.
