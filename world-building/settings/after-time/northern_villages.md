# Location: The High Enclave (The Northern Villages)

A cluster of five traditional human settlements situated in the **High Enclave** (formerly the High Atlas Mountains). These villages survived the Cataclysm by relying on low-tech methods and the natural isolation of the peaks. This location was the primary theater for Ren's third mission.

## Environment & Architecture
The High Enclave is a colder, alpine region where the air is thin and crisp. The landscape is dominated by jagged ridges and stone dwellings that cling to the slopes. The architecture reflects a Berber-inspired style, using rough-hewn stone and heavy timber.

The villages are highly organized and constructed entirely without modern technology. The inhabitants practice **Technical Absolutism**, treating all machinery with spiritual dread. They follow the **Wuxan**, an ancient spiritual tradition that reveres the five elements as natural resonances of the Earth, viewing the Core's digital technology as "Industrial Witchcraft" that corrupts these forces.

## The Wuxan Pentad
The High Enclave is governed by five primary settlements, each anchored to one of the sacred elements:
- **Ait-Aman (Water):** Arlo's home, built around a deep ancestral well carved into the bedrock. It represents the "Flow of Truth." 
- **Ait-Idar (Wood):** The "Village of Roots," situated in the lower valleys where they maintain the region's only timber groves. 
- **Ait-Ignan (Fire):** The "Village of the Spark," keepers of the great communal pyres that provide heat and ritual light.
- **Ait-Ighil (Earth):** The highest settlement, carved directly into the stone ridges. They are the "Guardians of the Peak."
- **Ait-Uzzal (Metal):** The "Village of Iron," which specializes in cold-forging the raw ore found in the mountain caves, shunning the heat of digital furnaces.

## Key Sites
- **The Well of Ait-Aman:** A central deep-water well that is the spiritual heart of Arlo's community.
- **The Ridge of Echoes:** A jagged overlook where the villagers watch for the Core's surveillance drones and the distant glow of the Dust Sea.
- **The Cable Trail Pass:** A dangerous crossing where the villagers must pass beneath the massive energy pylons of the Core to reach the lower valleys.
