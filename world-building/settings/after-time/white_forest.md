# Location: The White Forest

A massive, anomalous ecosystem where the trees are composed of luminescent "Analog Wood"—a biological-mechanical hybrid that is immune to Core signals. It is protected by the **Electronic Snake**, a colossal guardian that consumes any Synodic entity that enters.

## Characteristics
The forest serves as a safe haven for those who wish to avoid Core surveillance, as its internal composition naturally blocks electronic signals. Unlike the "Wood" technology of the Synodics, which grows like fungi and never corrodes, the **Analog Wood** and recycled metal within the forest are susceptible to oxidation. It is one of the few places on the planet where the familiar scent of rusted iron and organic rot persists, contrasting with the clinical permanence of the Core's cities.
