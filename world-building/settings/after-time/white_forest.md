# Location: The White Forest

Located along the **Silver Bight** (equatorial coast), the White Forest is a massive, anomalous ecosystem where the trees are composed of luminescent "Analog Wood"—a biological-mechanical hybrid that is immune to Core signals. It is protected by the **Electronic Snake**, a colossal guardian that consumes any Synodic entity that enters.

The forest is inhabited by the **Voidsmen**, a self-identified group of survivors and technicians who have rejected the "Witchcraft" of digital technology.

**Element Profile (Silver Bight):**
- **Wood:** 40%
- **Water:** 33%
- **Earth:** 26%
- **Other:** 1%
- **Metal / Fire:** 0%

## The Voidsman Philosophy
The Voidsmen believe that digital signals are a corruption of true energy. They live by a strict "Analog Code":
- **Energy, Not Communication:** Their signal-networks are designed to move physical energy and heat, not to transmit data or surveillance. They share power through the trees to sustain the grove, but they forbid long-range communication that could be intercepted or "encrypted" by the Core.
- **The Sacred Tap:** Energy is respected as a finite, precious resource. It is tapped into only as much as is needed for survival, never for expansion or industry.
- **Signal-Voids:** They specialize in creating and maintaining "Voids"—zones where the Core's digital frequencies cannot penetrate, protecting their sanctuary through absence rather than force.

## The Cloud-Piercers
The forest's primary towers are the **Cloud-Piercers**, massive trees that reach above the smog layer to harvest aetheric energy. They provide networked heat and sustinence to the entire forest, allowing it to thrive even when the Core's global smog blankets the sky. The **Voidsmen** use "Wood-Water" analog technology, making the forest a "bright area" visible for miles from the coastal deserts.

## Characteristics
The forest serves as a safe haven for those who wish to avoid Core surveillance, as its internal composition naturally blocks electronic signals. Unlike the "Wood" technology of the Synodics, which grows like fungi and never corrodes, the **Analog Wood** and recycled metal within the forest are susceptible to oxidation. **Null-Walkers**—specialized Voidsmen scouts—navigate the perimeter of the forest, monitoring the "Signal-Shore" where the Core's reach ends.
