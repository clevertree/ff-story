# Setting: Earth

Earth is the primary stage for the Human-Tripod conflict and the environmental collapse.

## The Before Time (Pre-202X)
- **Atmosphere:** Standard nitrogen-oxygen mix.
- **Geography:** Recognizable continents and megacities.
- **Tone:** A world on the brink of technological transcendence or collapse, largely unaware of the Lunar threat.

## The After Time (Post-Cataclysm)
- **The Glazed Oceans:** Vast stretches of former ocean have been vitrified into jagged green-black glass.
- **The Smog Veil:** Atmospheric ionization and volcanic ash have created a permanent twilight.
- **The Ruined Megacities:** Scavenged husks of 21st-century cities, now largely controlled by Tripod patrols or overrun by "Mechanical Cell" flora.
- **Cradle Zero / The Desert Base / The Fire City:** Originally a secret facility built within a vast, federally reserved forest in America. This was the headquarters where Dr. Elowen Vane and the Core scientists created the original Vessels.
    - **Physical Transformation:** Following the Moon Cataclysm, the local environment was scorched into a permanent desert.
    - **The Controlled Burn:** After the human staff evacuated, autonomous machines continued to follow their programming, gathering fuel and energy from across the continent and funneling it into the ruins of **Cradle Zero**. This created a massive thermal overload, resulting in a permanent "Pillar of Fire" reaching into the sky. This pillar is the primary source of the global smoke cloud that defines the After Time.
    - **Reclamation Mission:** As of Year 1 AT, the Archivists (operating from **Cradle Prime** on the Moon) have identified **Cradle Zero** as a critical tactical objective. Their mission is to reclaim the facility, extinguish the localized "Fire," and utilize the site as a terrestrial staging ground for their re-integration into Earth's politics. This transformation from a "Fire City" back into a controlled "Cradle" marks the transition toward the Year 15 AT status quo.
- **Settlement Clusters:** Small, low-tech human enclaves hiding in geological shadows (canyons, deep subways) to avoid detection by the "Hyper-Vision" of the Tripods.
- **The High-Tech Cradles (The New Cities):** The Archivists' ultimate vision for Earth. These are bright, powerful metropolises built using Synodic manufacturing.
    - **Paradise Protocol:** These cities are marketed as being completely free from "want and pain," providing clean energy, synthetic food, and security from the mechanical fauna.
    - **The Hook:** Entry into these cities requires the complete abandonment of indigenous culture and total reliance on Core technology. They are beautiful prisons of dependency, where human history is replaced by the "Correct Calendar" and individual agency is traded for comfort.
    - **Construction Status:** As of Year 15 AT, the first of these cities are being seeded, with **Cradle Zero** intended to be the primary terrestrial capital once reclaimed.
