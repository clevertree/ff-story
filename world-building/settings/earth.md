# Setting: Earth

Earth is the primary stage for the Human-Tripod conflict and the environmental collapse.

## The Before Time (Pre-202X)
- **Atmosphere:** Standard nitrogen-oxygen mix.
- **Geography:** Recognizable continents and megacities.
- **Tone:** A world on the brink of technological transcendence or collapse, largely unaware of the Lunar threat.

## The After Time (Post-Cataclysm)
- **The Glazed Oceans:** Vast stretches of former ocean have been vitrified into jagged green-black glass.
- **The Smog Veil:** Atmospheric ionization and volcanic ash have created a permanent twilight.
- **The Ruined Megacities:** Scavenged husks of 21st-century cities, now largely controlled by Tripod patrols or overrun by "Mechanical Cell" flora.
- **Settlement Clusters:** Small, low-tech human enclaves hiding in geological shadows (canyons, deep subways) to avoid detection by the "Hyper-Vision" of the Tripods.
