# World-Building: Settings Index

This index provides an overview of the key locations across Earth and the Moon, categorized by their state in the **Before Time** and the **After Time**.

---

## Earth

Earth is the primary stage for the Human-Tripod conflict and the environmental collapse.

### The Before Time (Pre-202X)
- **Atmosphere:** Standard nitrogen-oxygen mix.
- **Geography:** Recognizable continents and megacities.
- **Tone:** A world on the brink of technological transcendence or collapse, largely unaware of the Lunar threat.
- **[The Quiet Suburbs](before-time/suburbs.md):** Lem's childhood home.

### The After Time (Post-Cataclysm)
- **The Smog Veil:** Atmospheric ionization and volcanic ash have created a permanent twilight.
- **[After Time Geography](../geography.md):** Overview of the major AT regions in **Alkebulan** and the erasure of all old "Before Time" map names. **Alkebulan** is the only continent that remains comfortably livable after the Great Reconstruction.
- **The Continental Bridge:** The merger of **Alkebulan** and Eurasia following the Cataclysm; the vanishing of the Mediterranean.
- **The Obsidian Heights:** A range of jagged mountains and volcanic dead zones covering the former Middle East.
- **[The High Enclave](after-time/northern_villages.md):** Alpine northern region of **Alkebulan** and the technical-absolutist villages.
- **[The Silver Bight](after-time/white_forest.md):** Equatorial coastal sanctuary and the luminescent White Forest.
- **[The Ember Basin (Cradle Zero)](after-time/fire_city.md):** The primary terrestrial command center and industrial "Silent Forge" in the central desert of **Alkebulan**.
- **The Cable Trail:** Continental data and energy conduits.
- **[The Northern Villages](after-time/northern_villages.md):** Traditional human settlements and resistance territory.
- **[The White Forest](after-time/white_forest.md):** A mechanical-biological hybrid ecosystem immune to Core signals.
- **The Equatorial Dead Zone:** Scorched territory surrounding the Fire City (details in [Fire City](after-time/fire_city.md)).
- **[The Glazed Oceans](after-time/glazed_oceans.md):** Vitrified remains of the planet's water bodies.
- **Settlement Clusters:** Small, low-tech human enclaves hiding in geological shadows (canyons, deep subways).

## The Moon (The Shattered Cradle)

Once a symbol of human achievement, the Moon is now the source of Earth's suffering.

### The Before Time (The Apollo Era to 202X)
- **[The Moon (Intact)](before-time/moon.md)**
- **Lunar Colonies:** Small-scale research bases and early industrial mining sites.
- **The Project Alpha Site:** Unbeknownst to the public, the Apollo missions were used to seed Dr. Vane's SBM shards on the Moon.

### The After Time (The Fragmentation)
- **The Debris Belt:** The Moon is no longer a solid sphere but a cluster of massive, jagged fragments held together by erratic gravitational anomalies.
- **The Farside Cannon:** A massive, partially ruined structure on the largest lunar fragment. In the "Before Time," this was a single, colossal tube capable of launching Tripods.
- **Tripod Hives:** Structural "nests" built into the Lunar craters where the mechanical entities are manufactured and launched during the 15-day sun cycles.
- **Cradle Prime (formerly Cradle Prime):** The largest and most fortified fragment of the Moon, consisting of the far side. It still houses the **Cradle Prime** pyramid/moon base from the Before Time, which remains mostly intact and unchanged despite the lunar fragmentation. It serves as the headquarters for the Archivist Council. Along with Cradle Zero, it is the only location designated as a **Cradle**, housing the primary Synodic reincarnation laboratories.
    - **The Central Nexus:** The heart of the Pyramid where the Lunar Capacitor was located and where the global "Great Fry" was triggered.
    - **The New Lab:** A refashioned Archivist laboratory within Cradle Prime/Cradle Prime where Lem's aetheric presence was analyzed by Cassia Vane.
- **The Farside / The Apollo Landing Site:** The location of the initial Selenite encounter and Rahu's long exile.
- **Lunar Orbit / The Near Moon:**
    - **Zenith:** A specific altitude and alignment point in lunar orbit where spacecraft begin their controlled descent to the far side.
- **The Silence:** No human contact remains with the Lunar Colonies. They are presumed "First-Strike" casualties of the Cataclysm.
