# Setting: The Moon (The Shattered Cradle)

Once a symbol of human achievement, the Moon is now the source of Earth's suffering.

## The Before Time (The Apollo Era to 202X)
- **Lunar Colonies:** Small-scale research bases and early industrial mining sites.
- **The Secret Discovery:** Unbeknownst to the public, the Apollo missions uncovered "The Beast" slumbering beneath the Mare Tranquillitatis.

## The After Time (The Fragmentation)
- **The Debris Belt:** The Moon is no longer a solid sphere but a cluster of massive, jagged fragments held together by erratic gravitational anomalies.
- **The Pillar of Fire:** A continuous energy output from the largest fragment, often visible from Earth as a "Second Sun" that never sets but gives no warmth.
- **The Farside Cannon:** A massive, partially ruined structure on the largest lunar fragment. In the "Before Time," this was a single, colossal tube capable of launching Tripods.
- **Tripod Hives:** Structural "nests" built into the Lunar craters where the mechanical entities are manufactured and launched during the 15-day sun cycles.
- **The Silence:** No human contact remains with the Lunar Colonies. They are presumed "First-Strike" casualties of the Cataclysm.
