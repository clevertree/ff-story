# Setting: The Moon (Before Time)

Before the Cataclysm, the Moon was a solid terrestrial body, an intact sphere orbiting Earth, and a symbol of human achievement.

## Geography
- **Intact Sphere:** A complete, solid celestial body.
- **The Near Side:** Home to early industrial mining sites and small-scale research bases.
- **The Far Side:** The location of the most secretive and advanced human installations and the former home of the indigenous **Selenites**.
- **The Mare Tranquillitatis:** Site of the original Apollo landings and the secret 1971 "infection" where NASA seeded Dr. Vane's SBM shards.

## The Selenite History
- **Indigenous Inhabitants:** Prior to 1971, the Moon was inhabited by the **Selenites**, a highly advanced but reclusive alien civilization.
- **The Removal:** In 1971, the Technocratic Core launched a secret campaign to forcibly remove the Selenites from the Moon, chasing them out to secure the Far Side for Synodic test-beds.
- **Total Erasure:** Following their removal, the Core erased all physical and digital evidence of their existence. The world at large remained ignorant of the Selenite presence, and they are never mentioned in historical records or After Time media.

## Key Installations
- **Cradle Prime (The Lunar Pyramid):** A colossal, multi-layered pyramid structure built on the far side of the Moon. 
    - Established as a secret, high-security moon base by the Technocratic Core.
    - Designed as a self-sustaining facility housing advanced Synodic research and reincarnation laboratories.
    - The structure was engineered for extreme durability, intended to serve as a "ark" for the Core's leadership and technology.
- **The Farside Cannon:** A single, colossal tube capable of launching heavy payloads from the lunar surface. In this era, it was primarily used for clandestine equipment deployment.
- **Lunar Colonies:** A network of small research habitats and mining outposts (e.g., Shackleton Base, Mare Imbrium Mining) that were publicly known, unlike the secret Cradle Prime.
