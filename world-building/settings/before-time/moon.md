# Setting: The Moon (Before Time)

Before the Cataclysm, the Moon was a solid terrestrial body, an intact sphere orbiting Earth, and a symbol of human achievement.

## Geography
- **Intact Sphere:** A complete, solid celestial body.
- **The Near Side:** Home to early industrial mining sites and small-scale research bases.
- **The Far Side:** The location of the most secretive and advanced human installations.
- **The Mare Tranquillitatis:** Site of the original Apollo landings and the secret discovery of "The Beast" slumbering beneath the surface.

## Key Installations
- **Cradle Alpha (The Lunar Pyramid):** A colossal, multi-layered pyramid structure built on the far side of the Moon. 
    - Established as a secret, high-security moon base by the Technocratic Core.
    - Designed as a self-sustaining facility housing advanced Synodic research and reincarnation laboratories.
    - The structure was engineered for extreme durability, intended to serve as a "ark" for the Core's leadership and technology.
- **The Farside Cannon:** A single, colossal tube capable of launching heavy payloads from the lunar surface. In this era, it was primarily used for clandestine equipment deployment.
- **Lunar Colonies:** A network of small research habitats and mining outposts (e.g., Shackleton Base, Mare Imbrium Mining) that were publicly known, unlike the secret Cradle Alpha.
