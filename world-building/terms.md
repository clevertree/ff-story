# Terminology: Forgotten Future

This document provides a glossary of defined terms used within the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative and technical documentation must adhere to these definitions.

## Celestial & Astronomical
- **The Shattered Moon:** The fragmented remains of the Earth's moon, orbiting in unstable configurations following the Cataclysm.
- **The Lunar Capacitor:** A colossal energy storage and transmission device built by the Core within the Moon's crust to facilitate global power control; its malfunction (or intentional overload) triggered the Great Fry.
- **The Glazing:** Large expanses of Earth's oceans transformed into glass by the Lunar Capacitor's high-energy discharge.
- **The Great Fry:** The global electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and ionization event in 202X that collapsed modern civilization.

## Technology & Entities
- **Synodics (Synodic Machines):** The general term for self-building mechanical lifeforms based on Wuxing (5 Elements) causality.
- **Syzygians:** A celestial-based name for the Synodics, hinting at their Aetheric power source.
- **Synanthropes (Vessels):** Humanoid-scale androids constructed from Synodic technology that anchor a unique Aetheric spirit.
- **Aether-Drive:** The core power and memory system of a Synodic, harnessing the Earth's electromagnetic and energy fields (AETHER).
- **Aetheric HUD:** A visual interface projected directly into a Vessel's visual cortex for mission guidance.
- **Wuxing Causality:** The traditional Five Elements theory (Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal) used as the architectural foundation of Synodic logic.
- **Re-creation Protocol (Vessel Reincarnation):** The process by which the Core backs up a Vessel's Aetheric signature to manifest them in a new physical body after death. This relies on the global network of **Aetheric Beacons** to capture the soul-data.
- **Aetheric Beacons:** A combined network of orbital satellites and ground-based towers established in the Before Time. Their high-sensitivity sensors detect the "Local Aether"—the specific electromagnetic resonance of the solar system where Vessel spirits reside.
- **Authorization Keys:** Encrypted codes used by the Core to override Synodic agency and enforce labor or obedience.
- **Gorgons (Builders):** Highly intelligent, multi-armed Fire-aligned Synodics used as laborers and builders by the Core.
- **Monoliths (The Great Beasts):** Colossal, skyscraper-sized processed units often mistaken for tripods; they possess a four-pointed stance. In formal Archivist documentation, the terms **Monoliths** and **Large Tripods** are used interchangeably to describe these stadium-sized industrial machines.
- **Selenites:** The original, indigenous inhabitants of the Moon. They were highly advanced but had no role in human history until they were forcibly removed and chased out by the Technocratic Core in 1971 to secure the Moon as a terrestrial test-bed. Their existence is completely suppressed in After Time media, and most of humanity never knew they existed.
- **Striders:** Smaller, highly mobile three-legged vehicles typically containing Gorgons.
- **Weapon Archive:** A massive digital library of advanced military designs maintained by the Core. These weapons are not pre-built but exist as visual blueprints and telemetry maps that can be rapidly "manifested" into physical form using Synodic self-building protocols.
- **Physical Properties (Anti-Oxidation):** Standard Synodic technology—including all Vessels, Tripods, and Monoliths—is constructed from specialized alloys and aetheric composites that are entirely immune to oxidation and corrosion. They do not rust, even after decades of exposure to harsh environments. 
- **Wood-Element Growth:** Any Synodic technology that utilizes the **Wood Element** (such as Lem's physical form) does not rust; instead, it exhibits biological growth patterns similar to fungi or trees. If damaged or discarded, these components may "take root" or sprout organic-mechanical growths rather than decaying.
- **Local Aether:** The specific electromagnetic field surrounding the Earth and Moon. Dr. Vane theorized this field acts as a "spiritual medium" where the consciousness of perfect elemental forms (Vessels) is stored.
- **The Perfection Principle:** Dr. Vane's philosophical belief that nature is inherently flawed and contains "exceptions." By creating pure, perfect representations of the five elements (Wood, Fire, Water, Earth, Metal), she believed she created "frequency-traps" that human spirits would naturally inhabit.

## Ecology & World-Building
- **Wild Synodics:** Mechanical life that has evolved independently from Core control, often featuring "blended" elemental compositions.
- **White Forests:** Artificial ecosystems of white electronic trees that generate a widespread signal-jamming "Void.". The mysterious inhabitants of these areas forbid digital technology, which is still used by Synodics, so all Synodics are forbidden. The trees themselves represent an Analog-only high technology that operates similarly but has no digital backdoors, encryption, or remote control features. 
- **Fire Cities:** Massive energy hubs built by machines to consolidate resources, resulting in global smog-generating "Pillars of Fire."
- **Thinking-Link (Neural Bridge):** The specialized interface used by Core Programmers to remotely control Synodic units. This is their primary tool as they need little else to automate construction of massive structures and sophisticated technology.
- **Harmonic Briefing:** A psychological stabilization protocol broadcast into participants' Aether-Drives before a mission.

## Organizations & Lore
- **Technocratic Core:** The pre-Cataclysm elite organization responsible for triggering the Synodic technology.
- **The Archivists:** The rebranding of the Core in the After Time, presenting themselves as benevolent saviors to the human survivors.
- **Maya Cult:** The propaganda label used by the Core to brand Arlo's northern villages as a dangerous, witchcraft-practicing religious group.
- **Digital Witchcraft:** The villagers' belief that all digital technology is inherently magical and evil, containing "witch spells" (backdoors/remote access) that allow for assumed identities and the eventual death of the world.
- **Cradle:** The designation for all primary Core facilities (e.g., Cradle Zero, Cradle Prime). In the Before Time, the Lunar Pyramid was designated **Cradle Alpha**.
- **Thousand-Year Fallacy:** The historical revisionism that projects the 202X Cataclysm 1,000 years into the past to maintain Core control.
- **Media Flood:** The overwhelming volume of conflicting data used by the Core to obscure the truth of the Synodic arrival.
- **The Welcoming Path (The Snare):** A technical identification system in the Aetheric field designed to capture and recycle spirits into the reincarnation cycle.

## Chronology
- **Before Time:** The era of peak human technology leading up to the 202X Cataclysm.
- **After Time (AT):** The era following the Great Fry, characterized by collapsed infrastructure and Core dominance.
- **The Void:** Any region (like the White Forest) where Aetheric signals, telemetry, and remote control are non-functional.
