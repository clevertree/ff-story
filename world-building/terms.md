# Terminology: Forgotten Future

This document provides a glossary of defined terms used within the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative and technical documentation must adhere to these definitions.

## Celestial & Astronomical
- **The Shattered Moon:** The fragmented remains of the Earth's moon, orbiting in unstable configurations following the Cataclysm.
- **The Lunar Capacitor:** An ancient, non-terrestrial energy storage device within the Moon that triggered the Great Fry.
- **The Glazing:** Large expanses of Earth's oceans transformed into glass by the Lunar Capacitor's high-energy discharge.
- **The Great Fry:** The global electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and ionization event in 202X that collapsed modern civilization.

## Technology & Entities
- **Synodics (Synodic Machines):** The general term for self-building mechanical lifeforms based on Wuxing (5 Elements) causality.
- **Syzygians:** A celestial-based name for the Synodics, hinting at their Aetheric power source.
- **Synanthropes (Vessels):** Humanoid-scale androids constructed from Synodic technology that anchor a unique Aetheric spirit.
- **Aether-Drive:** The core power and memory system of a Synodic, harnessing the Earth's electromagnetic and energy fields (AETHER).
- **Aetheric HUD:** A visual interface projected directly into a Vessel's visual cortex for mission guidance.
- **Wuxing Causality:** The traditional Five Elements theory (Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal) used as the architectural foundation of Synodic logic.
- **Re-creation Protocol:** The process by which the Core backs up a Vessel's Aetheric signature to manifest them in a new physical body after death.
- **Authorization Keys:** Encrypted codes used by the Core to override Synodic agency and enforce labor or obedience.
- **Gorgons (Builders):** Highly intelligent, multi-armed Fire-aligned Synodics used as laborers and builders by the Core.
- **Monoliths (The Great Beasts):** Colossal, skyscraper-sized processed units often mistaken for tripods; they possess a four-pointed stance. In formal Archivist documentation, the terms **Monoliths** and **Large Tripods** are used interchangeably to describe these stadium-sized industrial machines.
- **Striders:** Smaller, highly mobile three-legged vehicles typically piloted by Gorgons.
- **Weapon Archive:** A massive digital library of advanced military designs maintained by the Core. These weapons are not pre-built but exist as visual blueprints and telemetry maps that can be rapidly "manifested" into physical form using Synodic self-building protocols.

## Ecology & World-Building
- **Wild Synodics:** Mechanical life that has evolved independently from Core control, often featuring "blended" elemental compositions.
- **White Forests:** Artificial ecosystems of white electronic trees that generate a widespread signal-jamming "Void.". The mysterious inhabitants of these areas forbid digital technology, which is still used by Synodics, so all Synodics are forbidden. The trees themselves represent an Analog-only high technology that operates similarly but has no digital backdoors, encryption, or remote control features. 
- **Fire Cities:** Massive energy hubs built by machines to consolidate resources, resulting in global smog-generating "Pillars of Fire."
- **Thinking-Link (Neural Bridge):** The specialized interface used by Core Programmers to remotely control Synodic units. This is their primary tool as they need little else to automate construction of massive structures and sophisticated technology.
- **Harmonic Briefing:** A psychological stabilization protocol broadcast into participants' Aether-Drives before a mission.

## Organizations & Lore
- **Technocratic Core:** The pre-Cataclysm elite organization responsible for triggering the Synodic technology.
- **The Archivists:** The rebranding of the Core in the After Time, presenting themselves as benevolent saviors to the human survivors.
- **Cradle:** The designation for all primary Core facilities (e.g., Cradle Zero, Cradle Prime).
- **Thousand-Year Fallacy:** The historical revisionism that projects the 202X Cataclysm 1,000 years into the past to maintain Core control.
- **Media Flood:** The overwhelming volume of conflicting data used by the Core to obscure the truth of the Synodic arrival.
- **The Bright Path (The Snare):** A technical identification system in the Aetheric field designed to capture and recycle spirits into the reincarnation cycle.

## Chronology
- **Before Time:** The era of peak human technology leading up to the 202X Cataclysm.
- **After Time (AT):** The era following the Great Fry, characterized by collapsed infrastructure and Core dominance.
- **The Void:** Any region (like the White Forest) where Aetheric signals, telemetry, and remote control are non-functional.
