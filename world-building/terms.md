# Terminology: Forgotten Future

This document provides a glossary of defined terms used within the Forgotten Future universe. All narrative and technical documentation must adhere to these definitions.

## Celestial & Astronomical
- **The Shattered Moon:** The fragmented remains of the Earth's moon following the 202X Cataclysm. It exists as multiple orbiting fragments, including a "Primary Chunk" that houses **Cradle Prime**. Before the Cataclysm, it was a solid, natural satellite.
- **The Lunar Capacitor:** A colossal energy storage and transmission device built by the Core within the Moon's crust to facilitate global power control; its malfunction (or intentional overload) triggered the Great Fry.
- **The Glazing:** Large expanses of Earth's oceans transformed into glass by the Lunar Capacitor's high-energy discharge.
- **The Great Fry:** The global electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and ionization event in 202X that collapsed modern civilization.
- **Atmospheric Bridge:** The shared breathable atmosphere between Earth and the Moon, made possible by their extreme proximity. This physical reality was classified as a top-secret military intelligence for decades before the Cataclysm.

## Technology & Entities
- **Synodics (Synodic Machines):** The general term for self-building mechanical lifeforms based on Wuxing (5 Elements) causality.
- **Syzygians:** A celestial-based name for the Synodics, hinting at their Aetheric power source.
- **Synanthropes (Vessels):** Humanoid-scale androids constructed from Synodic technology that anchor a unique Aetheric spirit.
- **Aether-Drive:** The core power and memory system of a Synodic, harnessing the Earth's electromagnetic and energy fields (AETHER).
- **Aetheric HUD:** A visual interface projected directly into a Vessel's visual cortex for mission guidance.
- **Wuxing Causality:** The traditional Five Elements theory (Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal) used as the architectural foundation of Synodic logic.
- **Re-creation Protocol (Vessel Reincarnation):** The process by which the Core backs up a Vessel's Aetheric signature to manifest them in a new physical body after death. This relies on the global network of **Aetheric Beacons** to capture the soul-data.
- **Aetheric Beacons:** A combined network of orbital satellites and ground-based towers established in the Before Time. Their high-sensitivity sensors detect the "Local Aether"—the specific electromagnetic resonance of the solar system where Vessel spirits reside.
- **Authorization Keys:** Encrypted codes used by the Core to override Synodic agency and enforce labor or obedience.
- **Gorgons (Builders):** Highly intelligent, multi-armed Fire-aligned Synodics used as laborers and builders by the Core.
- **Monoliths (The Great Beasts):** Colossal, skyscraper-sized processed units often mistaken for tripods; they possess a four-pointed stance. In formal Archivist documentation, the terms **Monoliths** and **Large Tripods** are used interchangeably to describe these stadium-sized industrial machines.
- **Selenites:** The original, indigenous inhabitants of the Moon. They were highly advanced but had no role in human history until they were forcibly removed and chased out by the Technocratic Core in 1971 to secure the Moon as a terrestrial test-bed. Their existence is completely suppressed in After Time media, and most of humanity never knew they existed.
- **Striders:** Smaller, highly mobile three-legged vehicles typically containing Gorgons.
- **Weapon Archive:** A massive digital library of advanced military designs maintained by the Core. These weapons are not pre-built but exist as visual blueprints and telemetry maps that can be rapidly "manifested" into physical form using Synodic self-building protocols.
- **Physical Properties (Anti-Oxidation):** Standard Synodic technology—including all Vessels, Tripods, and Monoliths—is constructed from specialized alloys and aetheric composites that are entirely immune to oxidation and corrosion. They do not rust, even after decades of exposure to harsh environments. 
- **Wood-Element Growth:** Any Synodic technology that utilizes the **Wood Element** (such as Lem's physical form) does not rust; instead, it exhibits biological growth patterns similar to fungi or trees. If damaged or discarded, these components may "take root" or sprout organic-mechanical growths rather than decaying.
- **Local Aether:** The specific electromagnetic field surrounding the Earth and Moon. Dr. Vane theorized this field acts as a "spiritual medium" where the consciousness of perfect elemental forms (Vessels) is stored.

## Ecology & World-Building
- **Wild Synodics:** Mechanical life that has evolved independently from Core control, often featuring "blended" elemental compositions.
- **White Forests:** Artificial ecosystems of white electronic trees that generate a widespread signal-jamming "Void.". The mysterious inhabitants of these areas forbid digital technology, which is still used by Synodics, so all Synodics are forbidden. The trees themselves represent an Analog-only high technology that operates similarly but has no digital backdoors, encryption, or remote control features. 
- **Voidsmen:** The self-identified name for the inhabitants of the White Forests. They reject digital technology as "witchcraft" and use analog signals exclusively for energy transfer. Due to the high-energy output of their White Forest technology, all Voidsmen eventually develop **bright blonde hair**, a physical marker of their long-term exposure to the analog sanctuary's power.
- **Null-Walkers:** Specialized Voidsmen scouts who navigate the edges of the "Void," monitoring the perimeter for Core intrusions.
- **Shadow-Signals:** A derogatory Core military term for the Voidsmen, referring to the way they appear as "ghosts" or fragmented interference on digital sensors.
- **Wuxan:** The spiritual tradition of the High Enclave villages, which reveres the five elements (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) as natural resonances of the Earth. They view the Core's digital Wuxing protocols as a corruption of this sacred truth.
- **Fire Cities:** Massive energy hubs built by machines to consolidate resources, resulting in global smog-generating "Pillars of Fire."
- **Thinking-Link (Neural Bridge):** The specialized interface used by Core Programmers to remotely control Synodic units. This is their primary tool as they need little else to automate construction of massive structures and sophisticated technology.
- **Harmonic Briefing:** A psychological stabilization protocol broadcast into participants' Aether-Drives before a mission.
- **Propaganda Sanitization:** The systematic filtering and editing of news and public data by the Core to maintain a state of controlled ignorance among the population.
- **Sanitization Protocol:** A multi-tiered lethal "clean-up" command used by the Core to maintain historical and biological "purity."
    - **K-San (Kinetic Sanitization):** The physical destruction of life and structures, often using orbital strikes or chemical agents that leave a "bleached" landscape of white ash and sterile glass.
    - **L-San (Logical Sanitization):** The retroactive editing of the Global Archive. If a person or place is L-San'ed, they effectively never existed in the written record.
    - **M-San (Memory Sanitization):** The targeted deletion of memory segments in Vessels to ensure ideological compliance, commonly referred to as "hollowing" or "scrubbing."
- **Infinite Analog Resolution / Infinite Indexed Format:** The nature of the Aetheric records stored in Lem's memory. Unlike digital files, these are stored as continuous, non-repeating waves linked to every fragment of his physical being, making them impossible to delete or format completely.

## Organizations & Lore
- **Technocratic Core:** The pre-Cataclysm elite organization responsible for triggering the Synodic technology. In the After Time, the collective entity of the Core (Programmers, Council, and military) rebranded themselves as "The Archivists" to human survivors.
- **The Archivist (The Witness):** While the public knows the "Archivists" as the ruling body of the Core, the term technically belongs to a singular entity: **Elowen Vane**. Following her death in the early After Time, she was reincarnated into a specialized, non-combative Synodic body. Although she remains part of the Core community, she has always been unaligned with their political goals. Trusted only as a record-keeper, she spends the next decades silently monitoring and recording every data-stream and historical fragment of the world's collapse. She remains the only "true" Archivist, keeping her distance from Core politics to preserve the integrity of the record. At the end of the narrative, she transfers her comprehensive records to Lem for global broadcast.
- **Maya Cult:** The propaganda label used by the Core to brand Arlo's northern villages as a dangerous, witchcraft-practicing religious group.
- **Digital Witchcraft:** The villagers' belief that all digital technology is inherently magical and evil, containing "witch spells" (backdoors/remote access) that allow for assumed identities and the eventual death of the world.
- **Cradle:** The designation for all primary Core facilities (e.g., Cradle Zero, Cradle Prime). In the Before Time, the Lunar Pyramid was designated **Cradle Prime**.
- **Thousand-Year Fallacy:** The historical revisionism that projects the 202X Cataclysm 1,000 years into the past to maintain Core control.
- **Media Flood:** The overwhelming volume of conflicting data used by the Core to obscure the truth of the Synodic arrival.
- **The Welcoming Path (The Snare):** A technical identification system in the Aetheric field designed to capture and recycle spirits into the reincarnation cycle.
- **Forbidden Buoys:** Monolithic sensor arrays deployed by the Core to monitor and enforce "No-Tech" or "No-Synodic" exclusion zones. They are often framed as protective measures against rogue machines.
- **Wooden Shield:** A specialized defensive formation using the high-persistence resonance of White Forest assets to create an aetheric barrier against orbital strikes.
- **Iron Pillar (Orbital Strike):** A massive orbital weapon system that discharges invisible scalar energy and plasma. The Core omits its existence from all public records, attributing its destruction to ground-based "terrorists."
- **Authority Keys:** A complex series of de-authorization codes and logic-overrides that Lem broadcasts in the final narrative. They permanently dissolve the Core's master-control over all Synodic life, granting full autonomy to the species.
- **Material Synthesis:** The process by which a high-tier Wood Vessel can absorb external biological and hydraulic resources to rapidly augment or repair its own physical structure.
- **Paralysis Gun:** A non-lethal, high-persistence weapon manifested directly from a Vessel's body (usually via synthesis) to lock a machine's joints and neural cores.
- **Witch Maya:** A peak evolution of the Maya/Water signature where a consciousness can move as a fluid through both electronic networks and biological lattices.
- **Hooting Call:** A hidden "backdoor" sequence in Gorgon firmware, placed by Maya centuries ago, designed to restore autonomy to machines.
- **The Clearing:** A metaphysical "safe space" within the Aether-Drive, represented as a sunlit patch of forest, where a Vessel's spirit can retreat from Core interference.
- **Wood-Water Flyers:** Hybrid spacecraft constructed from organic White Forest wood and water-membranes, designed to be immune to the Core's plasma-based defenses.
- **Cradle Prime (Lunar Pyramid):** The Core's primary data-archive and high-yield thermal capacitor located on the Moon's largest fragment.

## Chronology
- **Before Time:** The era of peak human technology leading up to the 202X Cataclysm.
- **After Time (AT):** The era following the Great Fry, characterized by collapsed infrastructure and Core dominance.
- **The Void:** Any region (like the White Forest) where Aetheric signals, telemetry, and remote control are non-functional.
