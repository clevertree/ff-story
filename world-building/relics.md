# Relics of the After Time

This document tracks significant physical objects, artifacts, and historical items that serve as anchors for the narrative, cultural memory, or technological turning points.

## The Glass Locket (The Invisible Grain)
A small, reinforced glass pendant containing a microscopic silver speck. It is the primary physical anchor for the "Invisible Grain" narrative cycle.

*   **Origin:** Created by **Lynn Vane** (during her time as **Selene**) as an infinitely indexed, high-resolution physical database of the Before Time and the Core's early operational protocols.
*   **Significance:** While electronic databases are subject to **Sanitization**, the Grain is a microscopic machine-material that requires a direct physical link (fiber-optic mesh) to read.
*   **Key Plot Beats:** 
    *   Passed from Old Man Azar to **Arlo** in **Ait-Aman**. 
    *   Given to **Lem** by Arlo as a refusal of the past ([Chapter 38](chapters/chapter_38_refusal.md)).
    *   Secretly copied by **Myrr** to ensure the survival of the data.
    *   Returned to Arlo and incinerated in the **Iron Pillar** strike ([Chapter 45](chapters/chapter_45_pillar.md)).

## Rahu's Thermal Blade
A specialized Synodic weapon designed for high-frequency thermal cutting, wielded by the Fire Vessel, **Rahu**.

*   **Origin:** Hive-manufactured as part of the Fire Vessel's lattice. It is optimized for "Playback" combat—executing pre-recorded, perfect strike patterns.
*   **Museum Display:** Following the events of the **Lunar Pyramid**, the shattered remains of the blade were recovered and placed in the **Archives of the Free State**.
*   **Significance:** It represents the peak of "Programmed Aggression"—a weapon that acts with total precision but zero human hesitation. It serves as a reminder of the **Anton Drexler** era of remote-controlled warfare.

## The Water Vessel's Locket (The Resonance Key)
A secondary artifact often confused with the Glass Locket, this item belonged to **Maya** and served as the initial bridge for **Lem**'s sensory integration.

*   **Function:** It contains no data, only a specific metallurgical resonance that matches the **Lunar Capacitor**'s frequency.
*   **Current Status:** Lost during the early skirmishes of Mission 2.
