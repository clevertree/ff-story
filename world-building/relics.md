# Relics of the After Time

This document tracks significant physical objects, artifacts, and historical items that serve as anchors for the narrative, cultural memory, or technological turning points.

## The Glass Locket (The Invisible Grain)
A small, reinforced glass pendant containing a microscopic silver speck. It is the primary physical anchor for the "Invisible Grain" narrative cycle.

*   **Origin:** Created by **Lynn Vane** (during her time as **Selene**) as an infinitely indexed, high-resolution physical database of the Before Time and the Core's early operational protocols. In an act of desperation before returning to the Core, Lynn hid stolen and hacked databases across several secret locations, including Ait-Aman.
*   **Deception Strategy:** Knowing the Core would scan her memories upon her return, Lynn meticulously crafted a "spiritual" cover story. She gave the locket to the villagers, describing it only as a vessel for the "spiritual memories of the earth and its entire history." She deliberately kept the database a secret from the village to prevent them from becoming targets for Sanitization. By ensuring the Core saw this "empty" relic in her memories, she successfully baited them into dismissing it. **Anton Drexler** personally inspected the locket several times on-site but, finding no active signals or known technology, dismissed it as a harmless "holy relic" not worth the conflict of removal.
*   **Significance:** While electronic databases are subject to **Sanitization**, the Grain is a microscopic machine-material that requires a direct physical link (fiber-optic mesh) to read. **Elowen Vane** invented the grain as the foundational technology for all **Synodic life**.
*   **Key Plot Beats:** 
    *   Passed from Old Man Azar to **Arlo** in **Ait-Aman**. 
    *   Given to **Myrr** by Arlo as a gift of gratitude for the northern defenses ([Chapter 42](../chapters/chapter_43_parley.md)).
    *   **Chapter 60:** Elowen Vane analyzes the locket and reveals its true nature: an inert but complete database that gives off no signals and must be connected to on a microscopic level to extract. Its data is finally decrypted and transmitted to save the future Chapter Transmission.

## Rahu's Thermal Blade
A specialized Synodic weapon designed for high-frequency thermal cutting, wielded by the Fire Vessel, **Rahu**.

*   **Origin:** Hive-manufactured as part of the Fire Vessel's lattice. It is optimized for "Playback" combat—executing pre-recorded, perfect strike patterns.
*   **Museum Display:** Following the events of the **Lunar Pyramid**, the shattered remains of the blade were recovered and placed in the **Archives of the Free State**.
*   **Significance:** It represents the peak of "Programmed Aggression"—a weapon that acts with total precision but zero human hesitation. It serves as a reminder of the **Anton Drexler** era of remote-controlled warfare.
