# After Time Society

Society in the After Time is fractured, defined by a technological divide and the "Great Abandonment."

## The Great Abandonment
Following the Great Fry (Year 0 AT), most Before Time (BT) cities were overtaken by Synodic wildlife. Uncontrolled Gorgons and Tripods repurposed urban infrastructure as "nests" or recycling hubs. Humans were forced to flee these centers to avoid the mechanical predators.

## Survival Lifestyles

### Rugged Village Life
Small, isolated communities that have rejected tech to remain "invisible" to the Core. These villages are primarily located in **Alkebulan**, which remains the most livable continent following the Great Reconstruction. In the After Time, all "Before Time" map names have been discarded as obsolete by the indigenous populations.
- **The Wuxan Worshippers (High Enclave):** Revere natural elements as "Resonances." They treat all digital machinery as a form of "Industrial Witchcraft" that corrupts the Earth. They maintain oral history that contradicts the Core's Thousand-Year Fallacy.
- **Village Rites and Leadership:** Religious leadership in these villages is a burden of the fearless. The Core routinely targets village priests as "Maya Cultists," forcing the majority of adults into a defensive "religious burnout" or apathy. Only the few who do not fear death—often those with a bone-deep belief in reincarnation—take up the role of the preacher.
- **Old Man Azar:** A legendary figure in **Ait-Aman**, Azar was the last of the indigenous high priests who lived in total isolation from the 21st-century world. He preserved the ancient **Tamazight Long Count** and the secret "Songs of the Cataclysm" using a hide drum and a central ritual fire.
- **Generational Fear:** The distrust of technology in these villages is not merely religious; it is a secular trauma response. It is a "Generational Fear" born from the observation of the 21st century's collapse, a belief that the misuse of technology is a cyclical sin that will inevitably repeat if not strictly forbidden.
- **The Voidsmen (Silver Bight):** Self-identified survivors who inhabit the "Signal-Dead" White Forests. They reject digital data for analog energy-conduits. They are physically identifiable by their **shock-blonde hair**, a side effect of long-term exposure to the analog energy-conduits within the forest sanctuary. They live in symbiotic harmony with "White Forest" trees to maintain a permanent sanctuary from Core surveillance.

## Wuxan Temporal Theory: The Long Count
The Wuxan villages follow a temporal system largely unknown to the Core, preserved by the indigenous lineages of the High Enclave in **Alkebulan**.
- **The Root Count:** The **Tamazight Long Count** identifies the current year as **4,213**, dating back to the first "blooming" of human civilization. This forbidden chronology provides the mathematical proof that the Core's "Thousand-Year Fallacy" is a fabrication.
- **The Tun (Orbital Shifts):** The Wuxan religious calendar tracks variations in the Earth's orbital period, known as **Tuns**. These shifts represent the planet's destabilization during different ages:
    - **The Golden Age:** 225 days per year.
    - **The Dark Age:** Fluctuating periods of 240, 260, and 273 days as the planet struggled to stabilize after the Moon's fragmentation.
    - **The Modern Age:** A sudden "stabilization" to 360 days, coinciding with the Core's activation of the **Aetheric Beacons**.
- **Knowledge over Control:** This temporal knowledge was solidified during the **Golden Age** when the Vessel **Lynn (Selene)** visited the Atlas Mountains. She taught the ancestors Wuxing theory and astronomy—not to control them, but to share the "True Count" of the universe.

### Core-Dependent Communities
The majority of survivors living in "safe zones" under Core protection.
- **The Archipelago Citizens (0 AT - 17 AT):** Early survivors rescued by the Core and relocated to floating island bases. Entry required **Technological Surrender**—giving up all 202X relics to be processed for "Digital Taint." These citizens experienced a "Sky Paradise" and became the primary supporters of the Reclamation. By 17 AT, most relocated to terrestrial mega-cities.
- **Bunker Cities:** Subterranean or fortified makeshift cities built while awaiting the completion of Megacities. Residents are entirely dependent on the Core for water, air filtration, and synthetic sustinence.
- **The Cable-Linked:** Settlements that follow the **Cable Trail**. They live in the shadows of the massive pylons, trading labor for access to the energy grid.

## The Technocracy
The Core operates as a global military and scientific order. They enforce the **Thousand-Year Fallacy** through several key policies:
- **Historical Harmonization:** The state narrative validates individual memories of the 21st century by framing them as the "Failed Bloom." Harmonizers like **Cassia Vane** ensure that any remaining archaeological contradictions are smoothed over.
- **Secular Supremacy:** The Core is strictly non-religious. While it permits the cultural worship of **Saint Rahu** and the practice of communal rituals like **The Clearing of the Hearth**, state law and Synodic Logic must always take precedence.
- **Synodic Service:** The Core markets its control over **Gorgons** and other Synodics as a benevolent domestication. Citizens are accustomed to seeing "tamed" mechanical servants building their homes and infrastructure.
