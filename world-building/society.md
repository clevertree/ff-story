# After Time Society

Society in the After Time is fractured, defined by a technological divide and the "Great Abandonment."

## The Great Abandonment
Following the Great Fry (Year 0 AT), most Before Time (BT) cities were overtaken by Synodic wildlife. Uncontrolled Gorgons and Tripods repurposed urban infrastructure as "nests" or recycling hubs. Humans were forced to flee these centers to avoid the mechanical predators.

## Survival Lifestyles

### Rugged Village Life
Small, isolated communities that have rejected tech to remain "invisible" to the Core.
- **The Wuxan Worshippers (High Enclave):** Revere natural elements as "Resonances." They treat all digital machinery as a form of "Industrial Witchcraft" that corrupts the Earth. They maintain oral history that contradicts the Core's Thousand-Year Fallacy.
- **The Voidsmen (Silver Bight):** Self-identified survivors who inhabit the "Signal-Dead" White Forests. They reject digital data for analog energy-conduits. They are physically identifiable by their **shock-blonde hair**, a side effect of long-term exposure to the analog energy-conduits within the forest sanctuary. They live in symbiotic harmony with "White Forest" trees to maintain a permanent sanctuary from Core surveillance.

### Core-Dependent Communities
The majority of survivors living in "safe zones" under Core protection.
- **The Archipelago Citizens (0 AT - 17 AT):** Early survivors rescued by the Core and relocated to floating island bases. Entry required **Technological Surrender**—giving up all 202X relics to be processed for "Digital Taint." These citizens experienced a "Sky Paradise" and became the primary supporters of the Reclamation. By 17 AT, most relocated to terrestrial mega-cities.
- **Bunker Cities:** Subterranean or fortified makeshift cities built while awaiting the completion of Megacities. Residents are entirely dependent on the Core for water, air filtration, and synthetic sustinence.
- **The Cable-Linked:** Settlements that follow the **Cable Trail**. They live in the shadows of the massive pylons, trading labor for access to the energy grid.

## The Technocracy
The Core operates as a global military and scientific order. They enforce the **Thousand-Year Fallacy** through several key policies:
- **Historical Harmonization:** The state narrative validates individual memories of the 21st century by framing them as the "Failed Bloom." Harmonizers like **Cassia Vane** ensure that any remaining archaeological contradictions are smoothed over.
- **Secular Supremacy:** The Core is strictly non-religious. While it permits the cultural worship of **Saint Rahu** and the practice of communal rituals like **The Clearing of the Hearth**, state law and Synodic Logic must always take precedence.
- **Synodic Service:** The Core markets its control over **Gorgons** and other Synodics as a benevolent domestication. Citizens are accustomed to seeing "tamed" mechanical servants building their homes and infrastructure.
