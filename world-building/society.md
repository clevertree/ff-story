# After Time Society

Society in the After Time is fractured, defined by a technological divide and the "Great Abandonment."

## The Great Abandonment
Following the Great Fry (Year 0 AT), most Before Time (BT) cities were overtaken by Synodic wildlife. Uncontrolled Gorgons and Tripods repurposed urban infrastructure as "nests" or recycling hubs. Humans were forced to flee these centers to avoid the mechanical predators.

## Survival Lifestyles

### Rugged Village Life
Small, isolated communities that have rejected tech to remain "invisible" to the Core. These villages are primarily located in **Alkebulan**, which remains the most livable continent following the Great Reconstruction. In the After Time, all "Before Time" map names have been discarded as obsolete by the indigenous populations.
- **The Wuxan Worshippers (High Enclave):** Revere natural elements as "Resonances." They treat all digital machinery as a form of "Industrial Witchcraft" that corrupts the Earth. They maintain oral history that contradicts the Core's Thousand-Year Fallacy.
- **The Selene Campaign (Before Time):** A Core psychological operation where the Vessel **Lynn** was deployed as **Selene**, a "reincarnated goddess" of antiquity, to win over the independent tribes of the High Enclave. While the Core marketed her as a divine savior to facilitate integration, Lynn eventually rebelled against the narrative, attempting to convince the villagers of her non-divine status. Most tribes rejected her for this "heresy," except for **Ait-Aman**, who maintained their loyalty to her as a mortal teacher.
- **The Invisible Grain:** A sacred relic of Ait-Aman, given to **Old Man Azar** by Selene. It is an enclosed glass locket housing a microscopic grain of machine material. According to village tradition, this grain contains an infinitely indexed database of "Pandora's Box"—all the systems of control, military strategy, and forbidden knowledge of the Before Time. Azar frequently quotes Lynn when referencing the locket: *“Responsibility belongs to the programmer, never the programmed.”* The Core dismisses the locket as a superstition, believing an "invisible database" to be a preposterous claim of the uneducated.
- **Outreach and Recruitment:** The Core maintains a "soft power" presence in the Enclave through diplomats like **Cassia Vane**. They offer prestigious internships to promising youths, such as **Arlo**, provided they reach the age of eighteen (a limit set by the collective elders).
    - **The Lost Interns:** A source of deep-seated village distrust. Villagers tell stories of youths like **Kiran** who accepted internships on the Core's Archipelago and were never "allowed" to return, leading to the belief that the Core uses recruitment as a form of bloodless kidnapping.
- **Old Man Azar:** A legendary figure in **Ait-Aman**, Azar was the last of the indigenous high priests who lived in total isolation from the 21st-century world. He preserved the ancient **Tamazight Long Count** and the secret "Songs of the Cataclysm" using a hide drum and a central ritual fire.
- **Generational Fear:** The distrust of technology in these villages is not merely religious; it is a secular trauma response. It is a "Generational Fear" born from the observation of the 21st century's collapse, a belief that the misuse of technology is a cyclical sin that will inevitably repeat if not strictly forbidden.
- **The Voidsmen (Silver Bight):** Self-identified survivors who inhabit the "Signal-Dead" White Forests. They reject digital data for analog energy-conduits. They are physically identifiable by their **shock-blonde hair**, a side effect of long-term exposure to the analog energy-conduits within the forest sanctuary. They live in symbiotic harmony with "White Forest" trees to maintain a permanent sanctuary from Core surveillance.
    - **Trade Ethos:** The Voidsmen trade with independent villages almost exclusively for rare biological or mineral resources, never for technology, however knowledge is their highest valued trade product, and facts are appraised based on their percieved self-evidence. Any trader caught in a lie is immediately and permanently blacklisted from the forest network.
    - **Link Sickness:** The psychological danger of the **Analog Mind Link**. While the union provides absolute truth, it is highly addictive. Over-users suffer from "Reality Drift," a condition where they lose connection with the physical world and prefer to remain in the shared, idealized perceptions of the link.
- **Economic Sovereignty (Tribal Currency):** Despite the Core’s promise of universal plenty, both the Voidsmen and the Wuxan villages insist on maintaining physical, tribal currencies—often cold-forged metal tokens or ritualized craft-goods. They reject the **Allocation** system as a "gilded shackle."
    - **The Lesson of the Switch:** Parents in the villages teach their children to imagine having every luxury imaginable and then losing it all in one heartbeat because a technician at Cradle Zero flipped a switch. They value the "poverty" of independent trade because no remote power can devalue their physical labor or erase their stores of grain.
- **The Mineral Rejection:** None of the independent villages will accept gold, silver, or diamonds as currency. While these were traditional stores of wealth in the Before Time, the indigenous populations of Alkebulan recognize them as the primary tools of exploitation that ruined their continent long before the Cataclysm.
    - **The Alchemical Deception:** Villagers maintain a persistent AT rumor that in the year 2015, the "Large Hadron Collider" created gold out of lead (Chrysopoeia), and that diamonds have been easily manufactured in labs for centuries. They suspect the Core of attempting to re-exploit "old wounds" by buying off villages with jewelry that costs the Core nothing to produce. To a villager, a gold coin is a symbol of a "fake promise."
- **The Transparency Schism:** A deep cultural rift between the Voidsmen and the other independent villages. While the Voidsmen use the **Analog Mind Link** to ensure total honesty ("checking every corner of the mind"), other villagers view the device as a tool of deception. They fear the link is capable of manufacturing "false truths" or that it represents a technological assault on the human spirit, leading to a breakdown in trust between the two groups.

## Wuxan Temporal Theory: The Long Count
The Wuxan villages follow a temporal system largely unknown to the Core, preserved by the indigenous lineages of the High Enclave in **Alkebulan**.
- **The Root Count:** The **Tamazight Long Count** identifies the current year as **4,213**, dating back to the first "blooming" of human civilization. This forbidden chronology provides the mathematical proof that the Core's "Thousand-Year Fallacy" is a fabrication.
- **The Song of the Root:** The oral ledger of Earth's history. It is performed as a series of story-songs that account for every year since creation. While lyrics focus on major "Causal Nodes" (events that changed the world), the state of humanity in the "in-between" times is always elaborated upon so that no time is ever skipped. At the transition between songs, the singer states the current year of the tally.
- **Defiant Visibility:** The practice of performing sacred rituals, like the Song of the Root, openly in the presence of Core monitors. The villagers stare directly into the Core's sensors while chanting, using their unbroken history as a shield against digital gaslighting.
- **The Tun (Orbital Shifts):** The Wuxan religious calendar tracks variations in the Earth's orbital period, known as **Tuns**. These shifts represent the planet's destabilization during different ages:
    - **The Golden Age:** 225 days per year.
    - **The Dark Age:** Fluctuating periods of 240, 260, and 273 days as the planet struggled to stabilize after the Moon's fragmentation.
    - **The Modern Age:** A sudden "stabilization" to 360 days, coinciding with the Core's activation of the **Aetheric Beacons**.
- **The AD Era:** High Enclave villagers refer to the After Time (AT) as **AD**—After Death (of the Moon). They view the fragmenting of the Moon as the death of a deity. The Core considers the use of "AD" a sign of "Maya Cult" influence, viewing it as a superstitious mystification of a purely technological event.
- **Knowledge over Control:** This temporal knowledge was solidified during the **Before Time (BT)** when the Vessel **Maya (Lynn)** visited the High Enclave in the years preceding the Cataclysm. She delivered a series of sermons in the Atlas Mountains, teaching the ancestors Wuxing theory, the True Count of the universe, and the endurance of the soul. These sermons were preserved as oral tradition in the five villages (the Wuxan Pentad), and modern leaders like Arlo are said to have mastered Wuxan theory by studying these ancestral records.

### Core-Dependent Communities
The majority of survivors living in "safe zones" under Core protection.
- **The Allocation:** The Core's primary method of social control. It is a post-scarcity centralized distribution system where every citizen has constant, seamless access to every resource they could want—food, housing, medical care, and transportation. There is no currency; the system functions through passive biometric recognition. 
    - **Recreational Allocation:** While basic needs are met, citizens compete for social status through "Recreational Allocation." The Core encourages the "purchase" of lab-grown gold and diamond jewelry to signal attractiveness and hierarchy. This keeps the population focused on artificial scarcity and vanity rather than questioning the **Master Lock**.
    - **The Villager Warning:** The villagers warn their children that this "gift" comes with the **Master Lock**: the Core can extinguish a citizen's entire life at the flip of a switch, cutting off oxygen, water, or shelter instantly if compliance is lost.
- **The Archipelago Citizens (0 AT - 17 AT):** Early survivors rescued by the Core and relocated to floating island bases. Entry required **Technological Surrender**—giving up all 202X relics to be processed for "Digital Taint." These citizens experienced a "Sky Paradise" and became the primary supporters of the Reclamation. By 17 AT, most relocated to terrestrial mega-cities.
- **Bunker Cities:** Subterranean or fortified makeshift cities built while awaiting the completion of Megacities. Residents are entirely dependent on the Core for water, air filtration, and synthetic sustinence.
- **The Cable-Linked:** Settlements that follow the **Cable Trail**. They live in the shadows of the massive pylons, trading labor for access to the energy grid.

## The Technocracy
The Core operates as a global military and scientific order. They enforce the **Thousand-Year Fallacy** through several key policies:
- **Historical Harmonization:** The state narrative validates individual memories of the 21st century by framing them as the "Failed Bloom." Harmonizers like **Cassia Vane** ensure that any remaining archaeological contradictions are smoothed over.
- **Vessel Culture:** While the Core is strictly secular, it permits the **Lamenters** (15% of the population) to worship Rahu and Tor as holy **Vessels**. The Core encourages rituals like the **Maya-Leaf Hunt** to maintain social cohesion and anti-Maya sentiment.
- **Synodic Service:** The Core markets its control over **Gorgons** and other Synodics as a benevolent domestication. Citizens are accustomed to seeing "tamed" mechanical servants building their homes and infrastructure.
