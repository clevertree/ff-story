# After Time Society

Society in the After Time is fractured, defined by a technological divide and the "Great Abandonment."

## The Great Abandonment
Following the Great Fry (Year 0 AT), most Before Time (BT) cities were overtaken by Synodic wildlife. Uncontrolled Gorgons and Tripods repurposed urban infrastructure as "nests" or recycling hubs. Humans were forced to flee these centers to avoid the mechanical predators.

## Survival Lifestyles

### Rugged Village Life
Small, isolated communities that have rejected tech to remain "invisible" to the Core.
- **The Wuxan Worshippers (High Enclave):** Revere natural elements as "Resonances." They treat all digital machinery as a form of "Industrial Witchcraft" that corrupts the Earth. They maintain oral history that contradicts the Core's Thousand-Year Fallacy.
- **The Voidsmen (Silver Bight):** Self-identified survivors who inhabit the "Signal-Dead" White Forests. They reject digital data for analog energy-conduits, living in symbiotic harmony with "White Forest" trees to maintain a permanent sanctuary from Core surveillance.

### Core-Dependent Communities
The majority of survivors living in "safe zones" under Core protection.
- **Bunker Cities:** Subterranean or fortified makeshift cities built while awaiting the completion of Megacities. Residents are entirely dependent on the Core for water, air filtration, and synthetic sustinence.
- **The Cable-Linked:** Settlements that follow the **Cable Trail**. They live in the shadows of the massive pylons, trading labor for access to the energy grid.

## The Technocracy
The Core operates as a global military and scientific order. They enforce the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**, claiming the Cataclysm occurred a millennium ago to erase the memory of the 21st century and ensure humanity views them as the only path to restoration.
