Draft2Digital Content Guidelines
================================

Last Updated October 27, 2025

At Draft2Digital, we believe every writer deserves the opportunity to become a published author. We cater to discerning, career-minded authors who care about the craft and artistry of the written word. We’re also a home for authors who may not be interested in turning their writing into a career, or may only intend to publish a single book, but who demand the utmost quality with their finished product. Our tools are designed to facilitate the publishing process and provide authors and small publishers with access to a global market of booksellers, libraries and subscription services.

We are not a destination for mass production book farms, nor for individuals who seek to publish 100% AI-generated books, low-content books, summary books, or low-quality books that do not meet the high standards of our partners and their discriminating readers.

The following list summarizes the types of content that may not be acceptable at Draft2Digital:

Public Domain Content

We do not accept Public Domain works.

Infringing Content

The user is responsible to make sure they do not violate any laws relating to copyright or trademarks for intellectual property they do not own the rights to.

Objectionable Content

We reserve the right to block any content we determine to be objectionable, including but not limited to hate speech and content that promotes terrorism.

Erotic Content

We accept many types of erotic content, but we require erotic content be properly self-classified using our Erotica Certification System (ECS). Most of our vendors prohibit some forms of erotica. Any attempt to mislead us about the nature of your content could lead to your account being closed. We do not accept content with pornographic images or content that glorifies taboo subjects such as sexual exploitation of children or rape.

Summary Content

We do not accept Summary books of other works including books that analyze, review, provides lessons about, or are workbooks for other titles that the user does not own the copyright for.

Misleading Content

We do not accept content that may deceive a buyer by mimicking the title, author name, cover design, branding, or any other metadata of a popular title.

Low Quality Content

We do not accept content that will result in a poor customer experience due to lack of editing, proper formatting, or unprofessional images.

Low Content

We do not accept content that has insufficient content and is centered around being filled out by an end user, such as journals, notebooks, diaries or planners.

Freely Available Content

We do not accept content that provides little to no value over information readily available to readers for free.

Mass Produced Content

We do not accept mass produced content including Private Label Rights (PLR), material written by content farms, content generated solely by machine or other automated processes.

AI Content

While we support AI-assisted content we do not accept content that has been generated entirely by AI/LLMs that has not gone through extensive editing from a human.

Noncredentialled NonFiction Content

We may require further documentation of subject matter expertise for nonfiction content. Accounts that upload nonfiction books about a variety of topics will need to show proof of subject matter expertise around each topic.
