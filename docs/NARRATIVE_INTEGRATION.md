# Narrative Integration: Chapters, Teaser, and World-Building

This document tracks how the manuscript chapters align with the teaser's visual narrative and the established world-building facts.

## Chapter-to-Facts Cross-Reference

### Chapters 10–14: The Pyramid & The Reset
**World-Building Facts Applied:**
- ✅ **Elemental Conflicts** — Water (Lynn) quenches Fire (Rahu); Wood (Lem) provides the structure for the merger.
- ✅ **Vessel Deception** — Lynn reveals her true nature; the soldiers' mission is revealed as a precursor to a reset.
- ✅ **The Lunar Capacitor** — Revealed as the "nexus" Lynn uses to short-circuit the solar system.
- ✅ **Technology Failure** — Stasis weapons fail against high-tier elemental manipulation.
- ❓ **Open Question (Historical):** How does the Core track Vessel activity during the Reset cascade? *(Partially addressed in `world-building/facts.md` under Beacon Network & Aether-Drive, but left opaque in-text for mystery.)*

## Teaser Alignment

### Verse 1: "The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire"
- **Narrative Equivalent:** Chapters 1-11 (Lem witnesses Tripods; joins strike team; Moon fragments)
- **Teaser Imagery:** Moon destruction, heat/fire, emergence of the Tripods
- **Timing:** 202X (Late Year), Days before/during Cataclysm

### Chorus 1: "Stars die"
- **Narrative Equivalent:** Chapters 10–14 (Lynn initiates the solar system reset; the "Great Fry" begins)
- **Teaser Imagery:** Celestial unmaking; total energy discharge
- **Timing:** Cataclysm Day 1-8 AT

## World-Building Facts Confirmed by Chapters

1. ✅ **Lynn's Authority** — Confirmed by her ability to command the Lunar Capacitor and manage mission logistics.
2. ✅ **Deep Cover Extraction** — Lem was hidden as a 'normal' orphan for decades; Lynn only retrieved him after securing late-stage military clearance and using the invasion as cover.
3. ✅ **Reluctant Unification** — World governments merged militaries gradually and out of existential desperation ('do or die'), disclosure of secret tech as a good-faith gesture.
4. ✅ **Vessel Merger** — Confirmed that Wood and Water can unify via the Aether-Drive to match high-tier Fire threats.
5. ✅ **The Lunar Capacitor's Purpose** — Confirmed as a "Reset" device rather than just a weapon of war.
6. ✅ **The Archivist Origin** — Distinguished between the "Archivist" ruling collective (The Core) and the singular **Archivist** (**Elowen Vane**), who survived her death via reincarnation to record the world's collapse in neutrality.

## Open Questions Raised by Chapters (Historical Notes)

### Critical (originally Must Resolve Before Next Section)
These items have since been addressed in the hardened lore docs, but are kept here as design-history notes:

1. **The Archivist Survival Mechanism** — Clarified in `world-building/facts.md` and `world-building/timeline/timeline.md`: Core data is preserved in shielded bunkers and the Lunar Pyramid, while the "True Archivist" (Elowen Vane) maintains an uncensored record inside her Synodic body.
2. **Ajax's Year 15 AT Departure** — Sketched in `world-building/missions.md` and the Master Timeline; exact logistics are intentionally elided on-screen, preserving Ajax's \"wanderer\" phase as legend.
3. **Lem's "Fracture"** — The merger leaves subtle Water traces and enhanced reincarnation behavior (see Sovereign Reincarnation notes in `world-building/facts.md`), but Lem remains the Wood Vessel.

### High Priority (now answered in canon notes)

4. **Rahu's Transformation** — Addressed under Fire Vessel notes in `world-building/facts.md` and `world-building/characters/rahu.md` (lunar exile and Fire persistence).
5. **Humanity's "Wipe"** — Canonized in `docs/OUTSTANDING_QUESTIONS.md` and `world-building/facts.md` as 25–35% survivorship with most loss in the early After Time.
6. **Lynn's Status** — Resolved as \"spirit extinguished, software legacy persists\" (AI Lynn and the Maya phenomena).

## Writing Continuity Checklist (Snapshot)

- [X] **Before Next Section:** Clarify Lynn's knowledge of the Cataclysm timing (Ch 15 reveals her as architect).
- [X] **Before Next Section:** Define what Lem learns vs. knows instinctively (Ch 3–14 shows his gradual realization).
- [X] **Next Section (The Silence):** Document the immediate sensory aftermath of the Reset (the silence of the electromagnetic void).
- [ ] **Transition to After Time:** Optional clarification of the physical mechanism for Ajax and Lem's return to Earth (if ever brought on-screen again).
