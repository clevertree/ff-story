## Chapter-to-Facts Cross-Reference

### Chapter 15-18: The Pyramid & The Reset
**World-Building Facts Applied:**
- ✅ **Elemental Conflicts** — Water (Lynn) quenches Fire (Rahu); Wood (Lem) provides the structure for the merger.
- ✅ **Vessel Deception** — Lynn reveals her true nature; the soldiers' mission is revealed as a precursor to a reset.
- ✅ **The Lunar Capacitor** — Revealed as the "nexus" Lynn uses to short-circuit the solar system.
- ✅ **Technology Failure** — Stasis weapons fail against high-tier elemental manipulation.
- ❓ **Open Question:** How does the Core track Vessel activity during the Reset cascade?

## Teaser Alignment

### Verse 1: "The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire"
- **Narrative Equivalent:** Chapters 1-11 (Lem witnesses Tripods; joins strike team; Moon fragments)
- **Teaser Imagery:** Moon destruction, heat/fire, emergence of the Tripods
- **Timing:** 202X (Late Year), Days before/during Cataclysm

### Chorus 1: "Stars die"
- **Narrative Equivalent:** Chapter 20 (Lynn initiates the solar system reset; the "Great Fry" begins)
- **Teaser Imagery:** Celestial unmaking; total energy discharge
- **Timing:** Cataclysm Day 1-8 AT

## World-Building Facts Confirmed by Chapters

1. ✅ **Lynn's Authority** — Confirmed by her ability to command the Lunar Capacitor and manage mission logistics.
2. ✅ **Deep Cover Extraction** — Lem was hidden as a 'normal' orphan for decades; Lynn only retrieved him after securing late-stage military clearance and using the invasion as cover.
3. ✅ **Reluctant Unification** — World governments merged militaries gradually and out of existential desperation ('do or die'), disclosure of secret tech as a good-faith gesture.
4. ✅ **Vessel Merger** — Confirmed that Wood and Water can unify via the Aether-Drive to match high-tier Fire threats.
5. ✅ **The Lunar Capacitor's Purpose** — Confirmed as a "Reset" device rather than just a weapon of war.
6. ✅ **The Archivist Origin** — Distinguished between the "Archivist" ruling collective (The Core) and the singular **Archivist** (**Elowen Vane**), who survived her death via reincarnation to record the world's collapse in neutrality.

## Open Questions Raised by Chapters

### Critical (Must Resolve Before Next Section)
1. **The Archivist Survival Mechanism** — The Core preserves their data in shielded subterranean vaults (Cradle Zero). However, the "True Archivist" (Elowen Vane) maintains her own independent records within her specialized Synodic body, which are impervious to Core censorship.
2. **Tor's Year 15 AT Departure** — How does the General leave the Moon's surface to become the "After Time wanderer" on Earth?
3. **Lem's "Fracture"** — Does the merger with Lynn leave Lem permanently altered (e.g., carrying Water traces) or merely exhausted?

### High Priority (Strongly Recommended Before "The Silence")
4. **Rahu's Transformation** — After his defeat and the reset initiation, how does Rahu evolve into the "Gorgon-like" lunar presence? Is it a survival response to the Capacitor's radiation?
5. **Humanity's "Wipe"** — How much of the human population survives the immediate Solar System Reset vs. the subsequent "Great Fry" famine/chaos?
6. **Lynn's Status** — Is she "dead" as an individual, or is she now a distributed intelligence within the solar system's new grid?

## Writing Continuity Checklist

- [X] **Before Next Section:** Clarify Lynn's knowledge of the Cataclysm timing (Ch 14 reveals her as architect)
- [X] **Before Next Section:** Define what Lem learns vs. knows instinctively (Ch 3-14 shows his gradual realization)
- [X] **Next Section (The Silence):** Document the immediate sensory aftermath of the Reset (The silence of the electromagnetic void)
- [ ] **Transition to After Time:** Explain the physical mechanism for Tor and Lem's return to Earth (if applicable)
