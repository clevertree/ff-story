## Getting Started

```
Log into your IngramSpark Account.
Select Add a Title in the Quick Links section on your account’s home page.
```
```
If you are only adding a print book, select Print Book Only
```

**|Files Are Ready**

```
If you have print ready files, select Yes, all my files are ready.
```
```

```
**|Files Are Not Ready**

```
If your print files aren’t ready, click No, I would like to see the available options for creating
files.
```

Here you can choose to create your print-ready files with our free book-building tool or hire a
trusted industry expert who can help you create your files.
To create your cover with the book-building tool, you can create from pre-designed layouts,
upload a jpg or png and finish the cover design within the tool, or upload a completed cover
as a jpg or pdf file.

If you choose to use the book-building tool, you won’t be able to upload print-ready pdf files,
and you can’t change this option later. If you start the process in the book-building tool and
want to upload your own pdf files, delete the book, and restart the process, this time selecting
“ **Yes, all my files are ready** ”.

If you have a valid ISBN and want your book available through IngramSpark’s global
distribution network, select **Print, distribute, and sell book**.

If you plan to only order copies for yourself, and do not want to distribute your book to
retailers and libraries, select **Only print book**.
