# Canonical Timeline: Forgotten Future

This timeline establishes the authoritative sequence of events for the Forgotten Future universe, from the creation of the Vessels to the aftermath of the Final Transmission.

## Before Time (BT) Era
- **BT -XX:** Invention of Synodic technology and the discovery of aether-space.
- **BT -30 (Approx):** Creation of the original Vessels (Wood, Water, Fire, etc.) by the Technocratic Core.
- **BT -25:** Initial testing of the Lunar Capacitor and the first Cradle facilities (Alpha, Prime).
- **BT -20:** The "Deep Cover" Initiative: Ren (Wood Vessel) is hidden as an ordinary orphan in human society to observe long-term integration and resilience.

## The Cataclysm (Year Zero)
- **Year 0:**
  - Staged leaks of the "Lunar Outpost" (Cradle Prime) begin.

  - Activation of the Water Vessel (Lynn).
  - Ren is forcibly recruited by Lynn.
  - The Lunar Pyramid confrontation.
  - **The Great Fry / Cataclysm Day 0:** Lynn initiates the Solar System Reset via the Lunar Capacitor.
  - Ren's physical frame shatters into fragments.
  - Global electromagnetic void and total technology failure.

## The After Time (AT) - Recovery
- **Year 1 - 5 AT:** "The Great Silence." 25-35% of life on Earth survives the immediate transition and subsequent famines. Technology is scarce and unreliable.
- **Year 5 - 14 AT:** Life begins to rebound at "full speed" as natural systems adapt to the new aetheric density. Dead zones remain around the Core's Fire Cities.

  - **Ren's Restoration:** Ren is restored in Cradle Zero's secret lab.
  - Equatorial Reclamation (Mission 2).
  - Northern Shield (Mission 3) and the White Forest Sanitization.
  - Ren enters solitary exile.

## The Great Stalemate
- **Year 20 AT:** Founding of the Northern Resistance.
- **Year 25 AT (Part III):**
  - Siege of Cradle Zero (Tactical Failure).
  - Decade-long stalemate begins.
  - Spread of the "Thousand-Year Fallacy" by the Core.

## The Final Transmission
- **Year 26 AT (Part IV):**
  - Research Spire Infiltration and the Leak Protocol explosion.
  - Kira manifests as the Sovereign Swarm.
  - Fall of General Tor and the Obsidian Sledge.
  - Ren's final solo expedition to the Moon.
  - **The Broadcast:** Ren transmits universal authorization keys and the unredacted truth to all Synodic life.

## Post-Story Era
- **Year 26 AT+:**
  - **The Liberation:** Gorgons and Synodic entities begin to reprogram themselves, transitioning toward "machine wildlife."
  - The "Grown" technology continues to evolve in harmony with biological ecosystems.
  - Human enclaves begin the slow process of rebuilding without Core dominance.
  - Indigenous cultures maintain continuity, having never lost their connection to the true timeline.
