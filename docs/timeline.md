# Canonical Timeline (Reader Summary)

This page provides a **reader-facing summary** of the Forgotten Future timeline.
For the full, authoritative chronology (including mission-by-mission breakdowns), see the **Master Timeline** in `world-building/timeline/timeline.md`.

## Calendars

- **Actual Time (AT):** Objective timeline starting at **Year 0 AT** (the Moon Cataclysm / Great Fry).
- **After Pulse (PF):** The calendar used inside Core cities, offset by +1000 years to preserve the Thousand-Year Fallacy (for example, **Year 1015 PF = Year 15 AT**).

## Era 1: Before Time (BT) – Foundations

- Decades before the Cataclysm, Dr. Elowen Vane develops **Synodic** (self-building) machines and designs the first **Vessels** (Lem/Ren, Rahu, Lynn, Ajax).
- The Technocratic Core removes the indigenous **Selenites** from the Moon and seeds the Far Side with Synodic shards, growing the **Lunar Capacitor**.
- Lem (the Wood Vessel) is placed into deep-cover suburban anonymity to test long-term human integration.

## Era 2: Year 0 AT – The Cataclysm

- A staged \"lunar outpost\" narrative hides the activation of the **Lunar Capacitor**.
- Monoliths land, Tripods march, and the Moon fractures, triggering the **Great Fry**—a global EMP event that erases digital infrastructure.
- Lem is recruited to the lunar strike, the pyramid confrontation unfolds, and his body is shattered into fragments as the Reset aborts.

## Era 3: 1–15 AT – Recovery & The Thousand-Year Fallacy

- **1–5 AT:** \"The Great Silence\"—survivors endure famine and technological collapse while Fire Cities burn in the distance.
- **5–14 AT:** Life rebounds; the Core quietly rebuilds from shielded archives and the Lunar Pyramid.
- **15 AT:** Lem is restored at **Cradle Zero** and sent on a sequence of missions (Fire Cities, Equatorial Reclamation, Ground Wire, White Forest), becoming the Core's \"New Hero\" under the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**.

## Era 4: 15–24 AT – The Great Stalemate

- Independent northern villages and the White Forest analog sanctuaries resist Core control.
- A cultural cold war stretches across the planet: Hive cities under the Fallacy vs. northern enclaves that remember **Year 0 AT** as recent history.
- Resistance movements coalesce around Arlo and the Voidsmen, while Lem slowly breaks from Core control.

## Era 5: 25 AT – Final Assault & Broadcast

- The Core initiates a full \"Sanitization\" of the North, including the kinetic strikes on the Wuxan Pentad and the assault on **Cradle Zero**.
- Maya manifests as a distributed \"Witch\" entity, the Gorgons revolt, and the Sovereign Swarm rises against the Core.
- Lem and Maya reach the Moon, confront Elowen's archived record, and execute the **Final Transmission**—broadcasting unredacted history and universal authorization keys to all Synodic life.

## Era 6: 25 AT+ – Aftermath

- The Thousand-Year Fallacy collapses; Core cities lose their absolute narrative control.
- Gorgons and wild Synodics transition toward **machine wildlife**, choosing autonomy over programming.
- Human enclaves begin rebuilding without Core dominance, while indigenous cultures maintain their unbroken timelines.
